Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “come up like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are consteronated from the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is that plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name might raise laughter.
One member behind Labourist Party said that his group is concerned that “this is what rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member behind Plaid said that the group as a whole "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Grand Conservatory noted that his group proceeds to a change in the name “with an open mind” but noted that the MWP has close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is spoken in the same way as the letter ‘u’ in yarkshirian English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes to the title, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be at the members of the Parliament."
The Law of the Kingdom Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public advice on proposals, where the broad support received the option of calling a meeting of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP was given the greatest support in the public discussion.
The members of the Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus can bring to the attention of President Elin Jones, who has to present a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The Reform Laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of members and the draft system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on a change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to the Republic of North Macedonia.
An all-all vote should solve dozens of years of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to the Greek territory and repeatedly protest against the request for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is the opponent of the plebiscite to change the title, declared that he would not follow the vote.
The referendum advocates, including Zoran Zaev's Prime Minister, argue that the change of name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin will be quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I spoke to are saying that he was at every corner of the bar and church,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's not one thing in there today."
The disappearance of the bars seems to be understandable.
"People are seeing another way today," he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the quarter where people go regularly.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later will be exactly where they started.”
As she adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats full of such types of people who would not be able to help the rest of the saints in the quarter.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will white” says, “and therefore soon the day when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into flats will become members of the churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before the Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original White Methodist Congregation moved away.
The building took over the black congregation, whose godlyness was near.
St. Martin took over the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of the 125th Street boycott, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem who refused to employ or increase black people.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building strongly, but when Father Johnson's ancestors planned to build it again, they ordered a doorbell.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and his successor to St. Martin, was proud to call "the poor."
The trade union, which played in July, called it "cultural treasure" and "non-replaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the world's first bellfire, played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger bell tower in a church in Riverside.
Mr Merriweather says nobody replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, there has been a complicated story of architects and builders in Sv. Martin, some of whom have called the laymen of the church, another episcopal diocese.
The Governing Council of the Church, consisting of lay leaders, sent a letter in July that expressed the concern that the diocese "will seek to pay the cost" for the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese did not participate.
Some of the Pharisees complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old boy in California who was diving for lobsters
According to official news, the shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy who was diving in California for lobster on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 o'clock near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday, listening to a boy calling for help, and then he fell to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of catching a lobster, but then “realizing that he was shouting, ‘He was screaming to me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken down the whole area of the key bone. ”
“I screamed to all go out of the water: “In the water is the shark!” adds Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
The poster ctt. Larry Giles at the press conference said that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was intended that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
The authorities for investigations and security closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the Space Market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build up the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty alleys in the style of a department store, where specialised sales outlets will be available.
As part of a strong market launch with cosmetics in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is growing, while sales of fashion and domestic needs are dropping, alleys with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores all over the country. In case of success, the next year will spread to other stores.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for racks that have previously been used for TV, microwave and home needs.
Sainsbury's states that it will double the size of the range of cosmetic products to up to 3 000 products and will also show brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space will also receive an existing range from the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to branded places similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also reinstates its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly demand.
In addition, in two stores Saintsbury’s will test the license of the retailer of Fragrance Shop. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London and the next year it will occur in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards daily shopping of small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like business houses, because the chain of supermarkets tries to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales of Argos branch and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains which he bought two years ago. Thus, the sales of food and acquisitions were even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to redefine separation with the cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfamiliarly.
At the beginning of the thousand years, Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the argument of dividing the profits from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold his 281 pharmacies three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who owns the chain of Lloyds.
Lloyds is supposed to play his role in four stores by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Trade director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all the needs and attractive environment and beneficial location mean that we now represent an attractive place for buying cosmetics that change old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is "distorted" after Holly Willoughby resigned for £11 million
Dragons Day Peter Jones "morning" star after TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from a contract worth $11 million with his lifemark so she could focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes brand and Truly's accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the brand Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 17-year-old show moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby made the star of Dragons' Day of Peter Jones by leaving their casual lifestyle business for the last minute – to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the informed sources, Jones “worshiped” when a television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to a new deal – worth up to 1,5 million pounds – he will no longer be able to spend enough time with the brand of their home clothes and accessories of Trula.
The company was compared to the Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and could double the wealth of the presenter Willoughby at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When the seventh-year-old Willoughby in Instagram announced that Truly's brand was leaving, Jones went out of Britain to one of his summer residences.
The unmarked source states: “My wife Truly was a very top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future to ensure it for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was shockingly shocked by all the parties involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters are full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving the moderators of This Morning, which belongs to the most profitable British stars, could become millions due to the heavy investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and the possible delay in placing labels.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and Dan Baldwin's husband have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly's brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and twenty-five-year-old Jones joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S Ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin in the moderation of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
The difficult act “and then we fell in love”
He talked about the criticism that journalists would get from him as a comment that some consider to be “an invaluable president” and how positive he was talking about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump replied with his ridiculous “voter” voice.
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in Trump, he appreciated as a big step towards the deuklarization of North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the meeting on nuclear weapons was stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the sumit of June in Singapore, the major North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea cannot see a “corresponding response” on his first steps of disarmament.
Instead, the US continues sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim in his opinion brought positive results – to end rocket tests, to help free the hostages, and to return the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And to defend his unusual access to information about relationships with Kim.
“It is so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of here to get into this crowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd in front of him.
The vast tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, in the post-Llombok earthquake situation, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s residents were expelled from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team that travels to Pala, but it's not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that Indonesian activists will evaluate the situation in Paul to see if international organisations will be allowed to assist.
Since the earthquake occurs very often in Indonesia, the earth is still unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although shelters against tsunami were built in Acehu, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of siren warning sirens in Paul from the tsunami probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was given.
Even in the best time, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of earthquakes, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the place of new calamities.
Improving bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
The next year, he will once again seek his election, but his government reduces the defaults in financing.
President Joko also faces pressure from the continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street battles between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people and tens of thousands of people have driven out of their homes.

The number of victims of wave tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Bureau for Disaster said on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and the tsunami waves rose to 832.
The 7.5 degree earthquake hit on Friday, caused a wave of up to 6 metres high, and many people in ruins of the broken buildings were imprisoned, said the press conference spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit because of a fight for "crisis of history"
His exile would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical Iranian followers in the Taliban style destroying a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "discipline" and "the effort to write history."
The chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the goals would also be the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't order or perform iconoclasmus in English Civil Wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent creation of Cromwell, whose author is Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the character that many think is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to the daily The Sunday Telegraph: “Men people consider Cromwell, although today something less than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of Parliament before external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unscrupulous historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well identifiable figure that represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminiscing."
The killing pig tore down the Chinese farmer
According to local media, an attack and death of a pig farmer took place in the South-East China market.
As on Sunday he wrote the daily South China Morning Post, a man in whom only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a overloaded artery in the pool of blood near the pigs in the Liou-Pchan-Shuej market in Kuejsu Province.
The pig farmer is being prepared to apply the vaccine to pigs in direct effect on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, China.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from Jün-n Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found that the door to the sideweeds was open.
He thinks there was a big blood-abundant pork in the pigs.
According to the information, it was confirmed during the forensic investigation that the 250-kilogram pork was tearing down by the farmer.
"Bratranec had all his legs bloody and ripped off," quoted the daily Guyang Evening News cousin, whom he referred to as "Wu".
On the security camera footage, it shows how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animals that killed men didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
Market administrator told Evening News that the pig was locked up, so as not to think of anyone else when the police at the crime scene collected evidence.
Market leaders are allegedly dealing with Yuan' family to compensate for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already happened in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and criticized men.
About ten years earlier, 300kg of pig attracted a Welsh farmer to a tractor and drove him to a farmer's wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitby said to the station CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “leaf”.
“They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of USA
Hurricane Rosa, according to the predictions, will weaken and shift over colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, the flood rain will be brought to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5am Eastern Time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is forming a low-pressure brawl and is moving east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, she will be in the form of a tropical storm and starts pushing tropical humidity north to the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of the Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Thropic humidity then causes massive rain in the coming days in the U.S. southwest.
Strains 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous floods, streams of drought and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity causes the precipitation to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some locations in the U.S., especially over the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain, the floods may occur.
Due to the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very vague to go on foot to the desert.
Strong rain can cause the canyons to become smothering rivers, and storms will bring local impact winds and flooding dust.
The approaching low-pressure brood will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the Southern California coast.
The total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller currents of the sutin and slippery cars.
It will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, Arizona will begin to draw closer to the unique tropical outbursts and on Monday night and the rain will spread on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the heavy rain will spread to the four corners, and it will last until the middle.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature across the U.S. because the Arctic will start to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, they will once again try to expand the protruding summer heat.
A warm start of October with temperatures around 27 °C from southern plans to parts of the U.S. is expected in most of the territory in the middle and east of the United States.
There could be 27 °C in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October the high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing has been followed by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people were watching six television channels, four-year-old election statements for Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, women who accused him of sexual assault, reportedly occurring in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate situation continued and the voters interrupted the current programmes with reports of sudden Friday's coup: an agreement by Senator over Arizona Jeff Flake that the FBI would pursue one week's investigation of charges.
Christine Ford told the courtroom committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her at a high school party in drunkness and tried to strip her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% certain that this was not happening.
More than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen are likely to follow the event.
The company counted average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that the statements broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
In comparison, it's similar to the number of viewers watching football matches in playoffs or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings from all stations when, according to Nielsen, he was followed on average by 5.69 million viewers throughout the full-day hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
The interest continued even after the negotiations.
Senator Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican, she announced that she would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, picked up how the protestors shouted at him when he was going to take the elevator to the hearing committee.
CNN was live over, as he stood blind with his eyes for a few minutes, and had him chewed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power while many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office made a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more in committee meetings.
All cable and television networks were sent live later when the court committee was to vote for Kavanaugh's nomination to vote throughout the Chamber.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were examined by the FBI by next week, which required the minority of Democrats.
Flakea partly convinced the interviews with his friend, democratic senator Chris Cons.
After an interview with Cons and some other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes for Kavanaugh's approval.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the FBI about the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May criticized the fact that it was “politics” about Brexit.
Ministerial President Theresa May, in an interview for the Sunday Times, accused the criticism of her plan to leave the European Union that “politicians” on the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at a Konzervative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the premiere on the front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called plan from Chequers when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose one another's duties is "a complete nonsense".
Shot at Wayde Simse: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of dying LSU player
Police arrested the suspect in the murder of Wayde Simse, 20-year-old LSU player.
Police department in Baton Rouge said that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and arrested on the basis of a second degree murder charge.
The authorities published a complaint video between Sims and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, they lost glasses.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs under the CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde after the interrogation.
According to the lawyer, bail was set at USD 350 000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the police unit for the Louisiana refugees, the crime labs of the state police, Southern University police and local citizens for assistance in the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for "deeping and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the match.
LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said that Wayde’s death was a team of "sorry" and "sorryed" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
The volcano is snoring ashes on Mexico City
The ash from the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The national disaster prevention centre of Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach volcanoes after Vulcan activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a series of thunderings and shocks.
On social networks, there have been pictures of front-glass vehicles covered by thin ash in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics noticed an increase in volcano activity, which is located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake was shaken by a central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The Vulcan known as ‘Don Goyo’ has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence met the order police, and thousands of people became involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which was divided by Katalánsko.
The usual police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, the ones on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, however, the police had to use a pair of shoes.
The groups supporting independence in a few hours sang “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of protesters of the Union who called “Let Spain live.”
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considers illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrate it, the tension remains high in the region seeking independence.
The voters spoke of a large majority of independence, but the participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the breakout were boycotting them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent conflicts across the region attempted to put an end to vote in electoral rooms.
The groups supporting independence remained out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest together, said he no longer hoped to gain independence for Catalania.
“ Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were happy to vote, but now we are in the dead end," he said.
Despite the important, although a close victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan Parties supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either left themselves to exile, or await their involvement in the court for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old montér Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and says that the conflict had mutilated politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tighter,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who has been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"The scandal in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repressions we have witnessed by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after the crash of a car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were imprisoned after the car repeatedly hit the house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was a damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone fired a crossbow on the car too.
Mengova Tref has secured Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston has secured victory
Livingston, who proceeded from lower division, shocked Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only second defeat from 18 matches as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengy Tref turned out decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian second place.
Gerard's team of this season still has no victory in the Premiership League on the guests' field, and next Sunday, the first Hearts will stand, which loses eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston expanded a series of games without defeat in Division for six games, so Chief Coach Holt, who had beaten Kenny Miler last month, hasn't tried a defeat.
Livingston didn't take his chance against the inexhaustible guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because its directity caused many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated his defense, but he failed before the gate, then Alan Lithgow just missed Craig Halket's head in front of the goal.
The house's enough to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Proti Rangers was set up a free kick and Livingston created a skulin, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent the Meng, which the ball in the middle of the penitentiary territory was flowing and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated by holding the balls, but the domestic defense for them was impenetrable and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper was mostly not very busy.
The same image of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's legs stopped Rangers Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow didn't hit another standard Livingston situation.
Livingston's penitentiary territory was constantly flying the centres that the players were cleaning up, and two penalts arrived – after Halkett's attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another hand.
“Fenomene” from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Without exception, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and the team hasn't changed since returning to the dirt, but the great praise deserves Holt as the team has fought since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, he was doing a great set of defenses, while Menga kept an emergency at Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all along.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't touch these standards anymore.
Their ending was lame – only once penetrated home – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of the table.
The Erdogan was expecting a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smiles.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, which aims at correcting the relationship between allies in NATO.
They have not agreed on a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and the adoption of Turkey into the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population in this town is outside Turkey.
Police, for security reasons, prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
There were also hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the ground.
Antiquity protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed like autokrats.
Deptford accident: Cyclist died after a car collision
In London, a biker died from an accident with a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street crossroad with the busy Evelyn Street street in Deptford on the southeast of town.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
Death occurred only a few months after another biker died about a kilometer and a half from the place of Saturday tragedy in an accident at Childers Street when the driver went off.
The Metropolitan Police have reported that the police are now trying to identify and inform men of their relatives.
The road is closed, buses drive after replacement routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Prisoner Long Lartin: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a male prison with high security.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still remain.
To handle the riots involved in eight prisoners in one wing, specialised overseers from the Trinádo team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
A spokesperson of the prison service said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, the prison workers were specifically trained.
Six staff members have been treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer periods in prisons."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended up in the hospital after the attack.
And last October, order units were admitted to the prison due to severe unrest in which personnel were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (the area where they are dry can benefit)
It is not normal for Arizona to hit a tropical low-pressure bras, but that's exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining hurricane energy Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
National weather services have already issued warning against floods on Mondays and Tuesdays from Western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The national meteorological service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept a tropical storm or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix’s status!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict the widths of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, places up to 150 mm.
In other parts of the desert northwest, including the center of the Skalist Mountains and the Big Men will probably fall 25 to 50 mm, with a local sum of up to 100 mm.
For those who do not threaten the flooding floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may also help, because the southwest of the United States just hit dry.
The serverweather.com states that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least “extreme dry”, which is the second highest category.
The hurricane Rosa route will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about a hurricane force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing its strength.
It is expected that he will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which poses a large risk of flooding.
‘In the area from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, the total precipitation of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm being present,’ says the serverweather.com.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesdays, arrive at the border of Arizona in the morning. Then she passes Arizona and enters southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe precipitation in Baja California, Northwestern Soora and the desert Southwest of the United States," reports the National Centre for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause mortally dangerous floods and streams of sutin in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three-year-old boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now “stabilized”.
As the police from Avon and Somerset informed, young men aged between 17 and 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "wrote the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a refusal of unscrupulous and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said to have a place in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh had “sacred wickedness and anger” during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, where he definitely and emotionally refused to call Christine Blasey Ford that she had been attacked several decades ago when they were teenagers.
She also told Ford about her accusation at the meeting.
On Saturday, the President said that "the Americans were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliantness and quality and courage."
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service at the end of the day.”
The President indirectly pointed to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about how important it was to involve the Republicans in mid-term elections.
“ Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump declared that the Democrats decided to "resist and obstruction."
The management adviser of the Republican Party told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is growing
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island Sulawesi hit large earthquakes and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Pala, hundreds of people met at the festival on Friday. However, during the twilight, the coast hit up to six metres of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything in their path.
War tsunami preceded an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami became a threat yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and didn’t escape, so they fell for the victim’s waves,” said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purpo Nugro’s disaster at Jakarta.
"The inner tsunami did not go alone, took the cars, logs, houses, hit everything on earth," Nugro said and added that the tsunami at the open sea was spreading speeds of 800 km/h before the impact on the coast.
He said that some people before the wave fled into trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
The aerial photographs that the agency has published in order to mitigate the disaster show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal city as well as on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people lived.
The Indian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) stated in its statement that energy released by early shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb thrown down in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow cove, which may have increased the tsunami.
Nugro described damage as “extensive” and said there was a divorce of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found buried under the ruins of the broken buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugro informs that the amount of victims and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Donggala, which is near the eccentric earthquake.
According to him, the communication was simply protected without any information from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in its statement that more than 300 000 people live in the area, adding that his workers and volunteers are heading into affected places.
“It's tragic, but it could get worse,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency had received considerable criticisms because it did not inform that Pala had hit the tsunami, although the authorities said that the waves had come at the time of the warning.
On the amateur footage shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the higher floor of a building screaming desperately warns people on the street from the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes of the coast, a water wall will hit which will take away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to check the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused a large failure of electricity, which interrupted communication around the Pala, so authorities could only easily coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending freight aircraft using Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other essential needs.
The airport in the city has been re-opened for transport of assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the evacuation center in Pala on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggaly came to the city of Paul, where employees hide in shelters from the whole building built in the yard, they saw images of ruin, says Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When assisted groups began their sad activities of helping disaster, some complained that foreign workers with great experience could not come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to a calamari site until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of province," says the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster, we can start international aid, but there is no such situation.”
When the second night began in Paula after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who were still missing, they still hoped that their loved ones would be those miracles that lightened by the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics freed a woman who was trapped under the care of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists on Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr Gendon said, as in the hours followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to the contestants from Pala who participated in the beach festival.
His messages but instead of a pair of blue ticks, they ended up with a grey mark.
"I think it means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in addition to ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press report from the police department in Newport, thieves removed $26,750 on Friday morning from Brink's bankomat in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money into it.
When he did, another man “experted from behind Brink” and stole a bag with money to be inserted into the ATM.
According to the press report, several suspects were seen from the scene, but the police did not clarify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Inform the police in Newport of number 859-292-3680 of possible identity information.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.
One-four-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and the pseudonym has been used as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should mention his new album, Yandhi.
The show will replace the singer Arino Grande, who cancelled her participation for “scientific reasons” as stated by the director of the show.
West has previously said that the word for him has, in addition to shortening the current professional name and religious significance.
According to my opinion, "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, where “you” meant West had heard about his album at the beginning of this year when he talked about the radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It's changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to the mere Ye, as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection on who we are."
The name has changed many other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred names Love (love) and Brother Love (Brandian Love).
Former West’s co-worker JAY-Z also recorded his name alternately and without him and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use an army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
By the time left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 began shooting people at peaceful demonstrations in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Okrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to students and opening up additional free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities to train young men into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert in the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published notification of AI, although the US as a whole do not have any formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be one in innovation AI by 2030.
“AI's double budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we're looking for another breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Lee said this week in an interview for CNBC that doubled funding could double the chance that next major AI discovery would be made in the US.
Lee, who published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's book “Supervelmosi AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures company, which invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in Othello, and later became Microsoft's research manager and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technological competition by the U.S. Government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to try hard to get government grants.
“Academic peaks do not lead China, but corporations” says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best experts from the university to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
In order to improve the AI efforts, changes in immigration policy could also help, according to Lee United States.
“I think doctorate holders should be offered green cards automatically” he says.
The Chinese State Council issued the Development Plan for artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way, as the National Science Council and other government organisations hand out money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Defence Ministry set up a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and academic background, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Commission for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that she was investing $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
As regards the NSF Foundation, it now invests over USD 100 million per year in AI's research.
However, US legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether they want to change the country name
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the Northern Macedonia Republic, which would solve several decades of old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of the North Neighbourhood constitutes a right to its territory, and has therefore vetted Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts as to whether a minimum of 50 percent of the voters needed to make the referendum valid.
Question in the referendum: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the arrival of an agreement with Greece?"
The beneficiaries of a name change, including the Prime Minister Zorana Zaev, argue that it is a price that is worth paying to Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," says Oliver Georgyevsky of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
But the election was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally voted.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjos Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko commit their votes in the Macedonian referendum to change the name that the country would open its way to NATO and the European Union, in Strucia in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and pulls chairs from tents built by people who are boycotting referendums.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads, not the service door," Kavadarkov says.
“ We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can approach others like China and Russia and become part of Euroasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring up Macedonia with a unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much investment needed.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zav said.
The result "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the desired participation.
In another survey organised by Telma TV Macedonian station, 57 percent were found to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
To be successful, it must be 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious impact on the pro-Western government policy since its arrival last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a goal through Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took out Brighton defense on Saturday and secured Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the submission of Aguera, his goal in 65 minutes looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a match that the Argentinian assailant got in the middle of the field.
He spoke between the three Brighton defenders and got into an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green dressings.
On the edge of Brighton's penitentiary territory, one defender went round and several others preceded.
He found Sterling next time on his left.
The English assailant put the ball in the penitentiary's land back to Aguer, who turned the right-hand goalkeeper into Brighton Mathew Ryan's right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," told the reporters the manager City Pep Guardiola.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have put a goal in that moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League game but he arranged Sterling.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on his left.
Sane worked the ball and then sent Sterling to the far-off pole.
Attacker Sky Blues kept the ball in the net just before he slipped out of the field.
The City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Shezer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the forever competitive Scherzer hopes to stand up for a pitcher on Sunday in a fight against Colorado Rockies – but only if they have Rockies who lead in NL West by one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for playoffs.
On Friday night, Rockies secured a wild card by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least play because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn't I play it?"
The Nationals have not yet reported who will start Sunday, but they are allegedly committed to throwing Shcherzer in such a situation.
It would be 34th start for Scherera. On Thursday he would train and pitch on Sunday when he normally had his leave.
The Washington pitcher has 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 shifts in this season.
Trump attended a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we have accomplished will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives remains five weeks.
He is one of the great, great ones – I do not candidate, but we are still in motion and I am fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power with whatever means they need, you see the wickedness, the resistance.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, according to him, decided for the "resistance and obstruction."
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added, and said that the Democrats are “annoying and evil and disbelieving and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court of Justice, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the vote of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you take the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, wait-- that was a really bad word of the body-- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party is no longer a varied view current.
It is intolerant to those who express their views
When the activists of Momenta on my local side voted in favour of my reminder, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labourist Members to whom they say they are not welcomed – because they sincerely said their opinion.
With my co-worker from Parliament, Joan Ryan was similar because anti-Semitism was built in a resolution.
In my case, I was criticized by the reminder that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, concerning Europe, paradoxically similar matters that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was written that “we want the meeting to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I was a local member of the Labour Party, they were exactly like the GC meeting on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, most meetings are not taking place, and the promise of “more lovinger” politics has been long ago forgotten if it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerating in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed whether acceptable to the direction of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, which I previously thought we had similar political views, suddenly they expected me to turn around 180° and stop positions that I could otherwise not agree with – whether it is the national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there are a lot of social supply, where they call for my appeal, they condemn the Wednesday policy and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those, colleagues who face sexist or racist insults every day, but never fail.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed in is how insulting happens to be the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the various opinion current and each proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised many times to stick back, so much does not speak, and then "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I went to politics for.
Since 32 years ago as a school student, I joined the Labour Party, provoked by the dissatisfaction of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who had left my general school class to fall apart, I tried to fight for better public service for those who needed them – whether as a local councillor or minister of government.
I've never concealed my policy, not in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, all I would say is that when the country goes through to Brexit that hurts households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not a moment in Nottingham, but my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is best interest for you all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives have a bit distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully fun game of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're at the front of the tables, like the only undefeated.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chances, which helped the home to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“In our fights we went through great trials and we are still not defeated, so I must be happy” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honor Ayru, the chances are better than us.
Five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climate, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, which allowed Melrose to use the numbers and Jason Baggot obtained the unaltered five.
Climo increased Ayru's pension and then scored in the half-life and turned the solo experiment into 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and five Patrick Andersons, turned Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who left the playground on the stretchers, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, which he turned to Climate.
The acting captain of Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose once again used the players thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short pressure.
The home returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for assaulting Climate without a ball, MacPherson from the penalt order placed the ball behind the moving maul of Ayru.
Climo turned again, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught a kick of David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five homemen.
Still Game star launches a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the field of hospitality. It has been found to be the head of a licensed restaurant company.
A six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which writes and plays along with Greg Hemphill's long-term comedy partner.
Two reports that the next ninth series will be the last series of shows, and it seems that Kieranan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an extract from the official register, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
Herec refused to comment on the report, but the source of the daily Scottish Sun indicated that Kienan wanted to engage in a “performing business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the inland Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are guarding against the La Paz Navy headquarters, which is decorated with ropes.
There is a blue flag above public buildings in the color of the ocean.
The water base of Lake Titicaca for Amazon is described by a password: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout the entire inland Bolivia, there is still a lively memory of the coast that the country has lost in favour of Chile in a bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as is the desire to roam the Pacific Ocean again.
These desires may be the largest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of an international court that should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive result,” says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of MSD on large screens across the country hoping that the Haag Tribunal will decide in favour of the Bologna claim that – after many decades of interruptions – Chile is obliged to discuss that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
The Charismatic Home President of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle to re-elect next year – also has great interest in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in the favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to appeal to someone in the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that the decision of MSD comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case “was not complex”, as Paz Zárate, the Chinese trade union to international law.
And the last four years, not only did they support the Bolivia thing, but maybe they just turned it down.
“The questions of access to the sea have been strengthened by the existing Bolivia government,” says Zárate.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all of Chile’s remaining good will.
Bolivia and Chile will start to act again once again, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to conduct a discussion.
Both countries haven't changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament won't happen if the US can't believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make promises on the summaries of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck at a dead point, more than three months for a Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "swimming hope" that the U.S. sanctions and objections against the declaration of the end of Korean war could sometimes knock Sever down on his knees.
Washington is careful about consenting to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps to disarm first.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general skepticism that Pyongyang seriously thinks that this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows that the latest trend of huge headgear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers have revealed a number of crazy huge headgears for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a fashion show that has all taken place at Paris's Week of Fashion.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creation on the pier.
An exhibition bite from Valentina was overrun with a beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers that flooded the heads of models.
Other excessively big supplements were decorated with melons, witch hat and even pineapple – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks have sewn their lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One production resembled diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a barking ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could come to fashion stores.
Grown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half-meter wide cream, all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation for the show pier – a famous beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimmers carrying it.
A dark orange rafi bag lined with rafi cane and a white leather handle was on Paris's fashion week with La Riviera spring/year 2019 collection from Jacquemuse.
Stylist celebrity Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – given that the designer had such great success, it would be difficult to ignore demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Scottish independent schools have many academic achievements, and this continues in 2018 with other excellent results. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities are just underlining this.
These schools have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (The Scottish Council of Independent Schools – SCIS) and are trying to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of services.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they chose, and their place as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we see that modern languages are still popular in schools and the desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak the language that he understands, he goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he's in the heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are in the first place of the tables, with the lack of success rates of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language reached the best grades of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages as the subjects selected by pupils are as important in the study plans of independent and other schools as those of STEM (sciences, Technology, Technical Areas and Mathematics).
The research carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 has shown that 17 percent of the inadequacy of language skills, for reasons which employers pose as problems in the surveillance of open jobs.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in the globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such lifelong skills.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with foreign people, one who speaks more languages will automatically benefit from competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013 between 4000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak in a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with the only language spoken by two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
If children know more languages, especially emerging languages, they will have more chance to find meaningful employment.
In Acts, each school differs in the language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain in the view by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have an independent school choice from several teaching languages, who are in the field of expertise.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children are preparing and equiping them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever they are waiting for in the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be introduced for the first time on a Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' uniform
Fans who look forward to LeBron James coming to see Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be here.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's opening match at San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it'll take.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably only take a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the practice, James asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the previous season.
"In this phase of my career I don't need pre-sussional matches," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia will launch a wave of the campaign performance.
It's the first of five toys scheduled for next week, including a stop in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a vacant post in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in mid-term, as the Republicans stand in November elections against the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's match in West Virginia can be monitored online through live transmission to YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing the candidate to the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense for accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior. It is expected that the confirmation vote of the Senate will be postponed one week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of land is to help Republicans to speed up before November's elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers, President Trumpa says that the five meetings next week are aimed at "to add energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Senate control is so important for his agenda that the President will drive in this busy season campaigns to as many states as possible," said Reuters, spokesperson of Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could come by supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania, and they could follow the media from Pittsburgh.”
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who's behind the polls.
“For Morris, it is not a good sign that the President must come to help him in research”, says Reuters Politologist from the University of Western China Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown my stomach to fight to keep hope of Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday couples can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all, in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum go now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it so that the pendulum probably moves a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, it has four points, and there are still 12 of them left.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form Spithe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal when he moved from the launch to green, and he is an example.
Celebrating screams were even stronger in the continuation of his bike, when he managed to pull the key foot to get the whole fight when they were with Tomas after two holes by two backs.
His Putt, who won the game for them at 15 holes, met with a similar algae telling you that the American team is not out there yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can prove nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
This course and the way energy flows both towards the stormy audience and confirms that these are the players of destination for Sunday’s victory, and that by the sunset over Le Golf Naitional will not be more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
At the same time, it's the best for both of us to have a different hole.
But talk about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cooperated briefly with Serge Garce, the hero of the morning games with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pits and two dables at the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in the abyss, from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will ever help you out of it.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow people's interactions in pairs, the advice they're giving, the advice they don't eat, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better so far as a team, and until the last day it has experienced a significant lead, but this game of two couples has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially of the states, have doubted.
The final day of Ryder Cup leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's games pairs to two balls went out with a head start of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly nearly won the Tiger Woods twice, decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to hold a trophy that they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games for two balls with the American side that failed in series 3-1.
The US showed more resistance in fours, won two matches, but they couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 games to keep his trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who, after a sensational weekend, received the nickname "Molliwood", are only the second couple to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of the Woods players and Patrick Reed in the game of two balls and then slowly beat the tired Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who took two matches on Saturday, showed the occasional brilliant flashes, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game pairs to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game to two balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the game pairs to 2&1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keepka - one and three in the world ladder.
But Europe did not have it on this pleasant fresh day in the southwestern of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 win over Spain by Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game of two balls and returned later to beat the pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game pairs, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-point game, although as a defending Fury's party needs only a draw to get trophies.
After the second day, the best in two days seems to be a Sunday counter-influence behind them.
North Korea says that “no way” will be armed unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the UN sanctions have deepened their distrust on the United States and, in such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted "significant measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as the stopping of nuclear and rocket tests, the dismantling of nuclear tests and the promise of not spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, confidence in our national security will never be established, and under such circumstances there is no unilateral disarmament."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the 'responsible' approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would have been rewarded for every gradual step, his statement appeared to be significant in the fact that it did not reject the unsustainable denuclearization just as it had already passed through Pchongyang.
Ri referred to the joint statement published by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim committed to working on the "deuclarisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea strives for formal termination of the war conflict from 1950 to53, but the United States has said that Pchjongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also called upon challenges to release tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “denucralisation first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force their targets and even object to the “end of war”, said Ri.
“ I realize that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem is, the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed out earlier at the UN during the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the US party to this issue, the dailyisation of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a pathetic situation.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea missiles in the U.S. is inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim as a “rare man” on suicide mission.
This year, in the UN, Trump, who threatened “total destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but said that many work and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denucleized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for it, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: “The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strongly and without stopping until we realize the complete, final, verified deuclearisation”
The Security Council unanimityfully supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to repress the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missile programmes Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly and Pompeo said that next month they would visit Pyongyang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey has not ended well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to bring North Korea to bear “gangster requirements” within a few hours.
North Korea committed itself to meeting Moon in this month to disassemble the missile area and also the nuclear complex if the United States adopts "correspondent measures".
He said that Kim told him that "corresponding measures" in which he hoped are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and was going to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course to teach them a good rest
A new course at Harvard University this year made all his students sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of macho studios throughout the night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self - care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who thinks is the first of its kind in the USA.
It was inspired to begin course after lectured on the impact of sleep depression on learning.
“At the end of the day one girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me now, in my last year? ’
She said that no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year explains to students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Medical Services of the University, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding out that students were really not sleeping during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of student colleges, where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books on the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance affects the lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in “schooling all night” still exists, added that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that there is an increasing problem of sleep shortage.
The amount of sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said - even to avoid being attracted, because sleep depression turns the brain into a hunger mode, so that man is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler to design a course that she graduated from one of his classes last year in Harvard's first year.
He said he opened his eyes and inspired him to push the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a comparative institution.
The professor recommended students to consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can decide your cirkadian rhythm, which leads to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal flooded Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy hit hard on Steven Gerrard's disgruntled 1-0 in Livingston.
Strana Ibrox tried to record her first victory from 4th to 1st February of the triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-life and the Rangers' lineup seemed to be without inspiration and determination to cope.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there might be more problems with Rangers after having had to be the Calum Spence bar referee treated with head injury after he apparently hit the object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on her side that drove past Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who took down the Hearts point last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained manhood suffocated his opponents at every step.
Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first released Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup man buried his big chance.
Far free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter hour's mark when Steven Lawless and Steven Thomson hit the table, but the referee Steven Thomson took out the Colombian challenge.
Rangers managed only two shots to target in the first half, but the former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and the crotch of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener may have been against the course of the game 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for that blow.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield wasn't reacting when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked Menga up for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost immediate result when the wing collapsed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was breaking through the lines and blocking the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind that they liked when Lithgaw and Halkett metal one long ball after another.
The Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor did well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson returned.
Almanach: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now the page from our almanach "Nieday Morning": September 30, 1882, today is 136 years, and it still comes... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's counter.
The sciences of Geiger Counter then became also a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of those seemingly unlikely scientists of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in God’s name is this? ”
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s reader, who is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, yeah, now he's really into it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” proteins that are common to many cancers, and then not reinjected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can “see” proteins common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute for Cancer at Bethesda Maryland said, "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 is "a growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to when immune cells were collected from patients and “educated” is to target cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended the pro-Trupovian preaching, in his magic hat, following his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was screened in the Saturday Night Live studio following a confused performance during which he praised President Donald Trumpa and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the hat of the Make America Great Again, he began to spit on democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
“ I often talk to white people and they say: “How can you like Trumpa, for he is a racist?”
If I'd mind racism, I wouldn't have been in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show of parody with Matt Damon in the main role in which a Hollywood star was joking from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Court Committee on the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's theater recordings were recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West.
West also complained to the viewers that his head ornament was getting eaten right behind the scenes.
“I was bullyed at the scenes.
They said, "Don't go up there with that hat."
That's ham!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and he added that he would "set up his Superman suit, because that means you can't say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were only earned by building a audience at least twice, and the SNL members looked worse, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said, "The studio was quiet.
Westa invited as a late replacement for the singer Arino Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing Song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the governing conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: DAVU, DES STEVIL DAVU.”
But the visiting talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was “just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.”
“But I NECHCI will reward someone (the buyer of his music or clothing or the support of his “change”) who I believe is presenting and sending to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and goes in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.

The game Thrones star Kit Harington has entered the toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
Actor, 31 years old, but he came out of the stereotype of the macho heroes and said that such role on the screen mean that young boys often feel that he must be claiming to earn respect.
Newly, The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the toxic masculine problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, recently married to his star on Rose Leslie's throne, also 31, admitted that the problem of “docela strongly” was expressed.
“Now I personally feel quite strongly - what happened so badly with the masculineity?” he said.
“What do we teach teen men about the problem we see here?”
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for rising toxic malehood due to its very male figures.
He continued: “What is born and taught?
What do guys learn on TV, on the streets, from them make it feel like they need every man to have his side like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because I'm sure a young man has changed to worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequela or sequela Games for thrones after the completion of the series, because he had enough "boss and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in the renewed right west of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.

"I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole life after," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, an object of love for Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series awarded with Emma's prize.
A few took place in June 2018 at Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected by this virus according to official numbers in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transferred by sex, which meant a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced almost to zero, according to Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is reported to be increasingly widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men are finally married to women.
Many of the transfers of disease come from insufficient sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of the effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denys the staff to escape the data of the GOP senators, the terms of "secure lies" and "conspiracy theory" are being ignored.
On Saturday, American Member Maxine Waters assessed the claim that a member of her employees sent personal data to three Republican American senators on the website of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by “ultraravic” scientists and websites.
“Lise, lies, and other contemptible lies” said Waters in his Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for American senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the Senate's discussion on sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh.
There was ever a leak after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Consumer sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that source of contributions is connected to Waters' office and published information on Waters staff members, says Hill.
"This unaffected claim is absolutely false and absolute lie," continued Waters.
“A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - in no case was he responsible for leaking this information.
This unaffected claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned an online criticism, including the former press secretary of Ari Fleischer's White House.
“This denial is angry,” said Fleischer.
"This suggests she has no temper to be a member of Congress."
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be resistive.
The plaintiff must not question the motives.
He must be calm and not disturbed."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the democratic criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who attended the elections against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
She stated in her statement that her office had pointed out “the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – weaker spy parodies Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case of this recovery of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this rough satira on the topic of how obviously bad the nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this embossed, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to wrap things up in a completely new way - that name more than anything else signal that is a wide comic work designed for non-English talking cinematographic audience.
He, of course, is the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims for smoothie glamour, has some of Inspector Clouseau's, a spy from Mr. Bean, and a great piece of this guy who won the only tone in Chariots of Fire at the famous opening of the London Olympic Games.
The character is also originally based on travelers and an international mystery man, which Atkinson once played in already forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this last edition There are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English, as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor's blade was briefly talking about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physics comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite bloated and superfluous, especially when “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Imosible themselves now offer comedy as a certain ingredient in their production.
Humor is more like he's supposed to be children than adults, and for me, the crazy tramps of Johnny English are so ingenious and concentrated, like Atkinson's silent movie game in Mr. Bean's person.
The ongoing assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy web network and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to dissuade an agent in the service - as much as a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure that has already suffered under the complete collapse of political inconsistencies: Emma Thompson will be playing the best of these characters, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs will inform her that once any of her active spies are in danger, he will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English itself, which is now employed as a director in some luxurious device, but at the same time gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: here's a few nice gangs, because English offers a spy academy similar to School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall because of the emergency brief and met with his former long- suffering partner Bough, who played Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the submarine, an excellent figure, on which Vicki Pepperdine's talent may even be wasting a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are back in action at the secret service of Her Majesty and are meeting with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullete, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyseu full of frisque floors: masked as waiters burn French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto Voltova's luxury yachts; and English launches pure anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's house using virtual reality.
I'm sure all the essays are ready for this last sequence, but let's say she's kind and turbulent, she's got something from the kids' television.
A rather mild matter.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really fit his talent?
Labourists deny that they develop a plan for English people to work four days a week to get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
Apparently, the Party wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to workers from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would have had a three-day weekend, but they'd still have the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea would "fall" into the economic agenda of the parties and is planning to implore the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A long-term member of the Labourists said to the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the positions of the party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labourist Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “Third working week isn’t our party’s policy, and the party is not taking it into account.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference last week to complete his vision of the Socialist Revolution in Economics.
Mr McDonnell stated that he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "signors" in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water companies need not return to their overall share because the Labourist Government could carry out a "judgment" on the basis of perceived charges.
He has also confirmed the plans to place employees in company boards and to create self-owned funds which give 10% of the equity of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the 60-minute show that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might have changed their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has dismissed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether any Republican senators might be squandered to attract their support.
In an interview on Sunday's "60 minutes" the correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, “Did you do it?”
He was decisive, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's decision, however, is insurmountable.
"I've already made my decision to Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean some pretty explosive accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the ones she called could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changes."
What is Global Citizens Festival and what has he done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be held the annual music event Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission at the end of the world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to be able to get a free ticket for an event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, email to the world leader, call or other meaningful means of helping to raise awareness of their goal of poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reaches his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in the way of convincing them to demand action, or is it just another case called “clicktivism” - people who feel that they sign online petitions or that they leave tweet change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters have been trying to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the fact that world leaders notify commitments and measures amounting to more than $37 billion, which have an impact on the lives of more than $225 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, Group 390 notified commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds still have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British Partnership of Investors and Realizers, who have committed to "to help their children grow into their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help in the end of the subnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of history from social injustice,” Ambassador to the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which calls for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, “Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty? ”
Global citizene replied: “It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we fall down and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and the anti-Apartheid movement we will succeed in front of us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the performers in New York City, who will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for a "block" to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of Interior
Washington can "where necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, reveal the American Home Secretary Ryan Zinke as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria - especially where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to channel energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States have the opportunity to make sure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, blocked, to ensure that their energy is not marketable," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event organised by consumer energy alliances, which is a non-profit group that takes place in the United States as a "energy consumer's voice".
He compared Washington's approach and dealing with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were practically the same.
"Economic possibilities for Iran and Russia are more or less investment in or replace fuel," he said, and at the same time refers to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including the American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "an inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trumpa, made the Berlin "rukomím" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars to double the existing pipe capacity to 110 billion cubic meters is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to develop pressures and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Mr.Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has taken a stand by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German organisation for the industry, the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a close look at the 2020 presidential candidate, says Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that after the mid-term elections she would look closely at the presidential candidate.
During the meeting of City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about the candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and correct our broken government, including the top female position," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I'll be close to looking at the presidential run."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said she was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm scared to the mortuary of what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trumpa and his appointment as the supreme judge of Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidature.
The research showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38 percent against the candidature and 48 percent against it.
Other high-level democratic names discussed in connection with the potential candidate by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he's gonna make his decision official in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent on the list in September one year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son passes through after his return may concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are going back with," said the audience at the meeting with Donald Trump in Tuls, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the word in the room” and told her about her son and other war veterans that“ they return a little different, return to self-esteem, return, and wonder if there is even respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and fliers do, and every other member of the army, gives his country.
He was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla in Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the police department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal call for new measures by the U.S. government that deny asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and periods on Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, said the NBC.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, who gave the Organization of Civil Liberties of Americans against federal policy in August.
She said that her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing all the problems they face with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the US has reinstated the decision of the Board of Appeal for immigrants from 2014, which has enabled illegal immigrants who have been fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the Attorney General Karl Racine stated that the new measure was "probably ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Act requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers continued to briefly argue that a policy that would deny the admission of immigrants harm the US economy and say that it is more likely that they would become entrepreneurs and that they would "give necessary jobs".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges in the immigration field to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or for political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on 11 June.
Azil never had the objective to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has already doubled, competes in finding survivors with time
The situation was getting worse and worse for the survivors.
"It's very tense," said Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her hot little boy in an evacuation center in the busy city of Pala.
“An ambulance will bring other bodies in for a minute.
Clean water is rare."
The inhabitants have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking care of things and trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were crippled.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in the spine and shoulders, rested with Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of continued severe aftershocks.
The tears filled his eyes when he said that the violent earthquake was shaking the hotel's room on the fifth floor, sharing a room with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save.
I think I was dragged into the wall of the ruins," said Haris for the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife was calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
Ambassador United States accuses China of “scanning” by propaganda commercials
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page commercial advertisement in the American daily, which dealt with the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American media to spread propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday about the China Daily bonus paid in Des Moines' register - the state of the biggest sales newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to get mixed into US congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere with the US elections meant what the US leaders said was that Reuters was a new phase of escalating campaigns by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to include advertising in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of imports.
Chinese remuneration sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to intervene with exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this ham by publishing propaganda commercials in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the US government uses a valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid ads in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast to the China's newspaper stand, you will find limited disagreeable voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unnatural views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic track of China, given that the media belongs to the company 'China Communist Party', wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their oxen before election for the debakl with Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for the chief judge of Brett Kavanaug, who is facing several accusations from sexual assault, analysts warned that during the mid-term elections they will get a response, especially from women.
Emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was trying to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm the voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and speaker of the progressive group MoveOn, the newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters scandaled “The People of the People ” at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans, who are in charge of the judicial commission, decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break record," said Stu Rothenberg, impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
However, this could be higher, especially among the weighting female voters on the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who do not like the President, but often do not vote."
Even before the Ford's public testimony was made public, imposing its charges on sexual assault on the candidate of the highest court of analysts suggested that, if the Republicans had confirmed, they might follow resistance.
"It was a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote in committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will use it on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, the head of the US priority group, which helps vote Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in the view of whom to believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sympathy for the second appointed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent indicated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, said the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web informers plan to start a new internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the invention of World Wide Web, launches a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open source platform of Berners-Lee with the name Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, Inrupt’s objective was “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that enables people to create their own "personal online data storage" or DS.
It may contain lists of contacts, list of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional on a personal online data storage site is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce's CEO, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees working on the project, cooperated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his paper on the media published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," he added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A spiritual celebration received by Viktoriin Kriz during World War I
There have been celebrations for 100 years since the only spiritual Church of England gained during the first World War Viktorian Cross as a warrior.
Lieutenant General Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids showed him on Saturday at a festival parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, revealed a memorial stone.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was “genetically symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and strong shooting from field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he reached the first line, and with “the highest courage” he led the line forward before he put himself in the firefield and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were “what I could never do, but something that's humiliating.”
Together with her brother Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by Brentwood's youth group, they laid down a wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honour that he could participate in the show” and added that “the crime of the true hero is shown by the support that many people will provide.”
The MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa's pig.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the desperate Bellator 206, just to deny you the main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main page and live broadcasts throughout the night at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's games, the audience in the UK remained amazing when the news changed to the Peppa pig show.
Some remained uninterrupted after they were awake until early morning due to the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in the broadcast for children as "a certain form of a bad joke."
“As a result of government regulation, such content is not suitable at 6 am, and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked for this transfer.
"Peppa Cup," yes.
The president, Bellator Scott Cook, said that they would work on the program so that in the future there would be audiences in the UK.
"I think if I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cook said.
“But there is six o’clock in the morning, and we cannot make it to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were lots of texts going back and forth, and not all were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five matches instead of six – how we usually do it – and we have tried with all the strength to keep the promise to the fans and we have failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “low” because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of invaluableness to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be a success.
24 - year - old sportsman said that until he entered high school, he did not realize that “not all are like him.”
On the first discussion, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, said that he spoke loudly about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that thanks to the possibility of becoming a parent less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of Kirsty Young's long-term show had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a proxy in Lavern’s first program, said that he felt “less” than anyone else who grew up with him at the same time, because “it was not socially unacceptable to you guys and girls.”
He said: “When these feelings of invaluableness and other things were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was ‘someone’, said not to disappoint anyone who might find out how it was with his sexuality.
The dual holder of the bronze Olympic Medal has become a fighter for the rights of LGBT movement with a high profile and has used his presence on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he'd heard from him because he felt lucky he could live openly without consequences and he wanted to add hope to others.
This threefold world champion stated that he was loved to a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “it had been unprepared. ”
Daley was the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older, took over last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – at your first Olympic age he was when he was 14 and his father died three years later on cancer – he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar increases and falls.
Double adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said that "the whole point of view has changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of "to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't deal with him dying, and the last thing he asked was if he had tickets for the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The year Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and gained a bronze.
“I knew I dreamed about it my whole life – jumping before the sight of our home games in Olympic Games, I didn’t know better," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first composition – Proud from Heather Small – which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and kept creating goose bumps in it.

Mickelson, who was out of shape on Saturday at Ryder Cup, ended up on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, Ryder Cup, but he would have to tune out a form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the events held every two years by the record of the underweight, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of being in the centre of the event, as it used to be in the US, he spent five times the main winner of his day alternately among cheerleaders and work on the game in a row that he hoped to correct what tormented him.
This 48-year-old player never faced the most direct of the driverships, even at the top of his career, so he's not the perfect choice for Le Golf National narrow course, where long-term terrain routinely punishing stray missiles.
And if the golf course isn't very troubling about itself, it's facing Mickelson in the ninth Sunday match of the exact British Open Francescu Molinarim champion, who won all four of his matches in the Tommy Fleetwood team this week.
If the Americans, who had four points less, began 12 separate swords, they escaped fast entering, Mickelson's macho could have turned out to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and did not add anything else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patting me on his back, gave me his hand around his shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“ That’s how much they believe.
He is a member of the Hall of straw, and in the past and this week, he has been so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine two pops to play.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will overcome Nick Falda's record in most of the west of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of its individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 prohers and seven draws, although Furyk says that his presence of the team brought some tangible results.
“He is funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great companion in the team’s room," he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they came to see him this week, which was fun to observe.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience knows that a great leadership towards singles from recent days in Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Data debuted at the 1997 match in Valderram, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over Americans, but in the target plane they got a very tight welcome 1411⁄21⁄2.
"You must continue to remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderram, and in Broklin, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only close," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching, when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to Le Golf National lead 10-6.
So history and every member of this team showed me it wasn't behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's what they're trying to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'm going to focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased by the fact that his players were in a difficult golf course, added: “I could never do it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
They prepare individual performances tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it goes well, but when you're supposed to be there for yourself, your golfer's capacity is fully checked.
This is the message you have to give to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players to play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great turns when he was part of the winning team in Broklin to end up as a loser when Europe reached the “Minnah miracle”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players to head back to the last day.
“ Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, like in Mednah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts considerable pressure on those intermediate matches.
According to this, we set up a lineup and made sure that the boys feel like you know, like we should be charming tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack and building up with Rory McIlroy in the top match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I think he covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
The German new warship has been reinstated
The most recent German naval fregata was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available at least one more year due to error systems and snowy coasts, reports local media.
The operation of the leader of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, a completely new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to be a part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the van made the fate of this ambitious project difficult.
As a replacement for the ageing Bremen class ferrets, four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be used, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be available for up to two years outside the domestic ports.
However, continued delays mean that the top nautical ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to overseas – will be obsolete until they are put into operation, observes Die Zeit's daily.
The unfamiliar fregata F125 came to the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship after delivery.
Few were known for the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental "software errors and failures on metal elements" that would make the warship useless in putting into battle.
Software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuertmberg class vessel will operate some 120 sailors – half of the employees that were needed on Bremen class ferrets.
It has also proved that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to failures on metal elements, the problem is also the price of the whole project – including crew training.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion Euros the price for a negative EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest ferrets were particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is falling too much.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the Marine Army are “becoming ships capable of deployment.”
This representative stated that the problems were continuously packed because the old ships were excluded from operation but no replacements were provided.
He commented that none of the Baden-Wuertmberg class ferrets were able to become part of the Navy’s equipment.
The National Trust organization listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out at the neo-terres residence in Scotland’s vacuum room to discover how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities for the conservation of this kind.
A study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats of starling and smallest and brown long and water in the Botanical Garden Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this bat estate, which will monitor the activity of bats throughout the whole year.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings finds the frequency of bats calling and what individual types do.
Then a map of habitat will be issued and a report that will create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the work of the habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and the best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the entire UK in the last century have been very strong.
They are threatened by construction and territorial development that affect colony and natural environment.
The risks can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful when hunting prey than their eyes.
They use intelligent echo-location techniques to trace bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 77,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on colonies, and sometimes also rescue work.
This organization even set up the first and only reserved non-heat reservation in the Threave residence in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the estate David Thompson states that this is ideal for them.
"Here in Threeve we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees, and the best habitat.
But there is too much that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It highlights the importance of control of bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that unconscious destruction of one mother nest may kill up to 400 females and adolescents, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill them, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to contribute to the work and to help.
She said: “About our bats and many species that we do not know how their populations are doing, we must learn a lot about it.”
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo named rape for “false reports” and said that people “want to be visible” using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed about these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $750,000 to keep quiet about the case, informs Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after publication, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video about his 142 million follow-up and called information for “false messages”.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-fold holder of the Golden Ball Award for the camera.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they call my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with the smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel's unconsumptuous charges, which have been referred to as “an inadmissible notice of suspicion in private areas”.
Legal Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the appropriate severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights recently."
The alleged incident was expected to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Las Vegas casino suite.
Following a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the playroom, where he reportedly raped her in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, according to the documentation in the Clark County District Court.
Mayorca claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, bowed down and told her that he was "99 percent" "claw" and "one percent" disappointed.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with the out-of-court settlement, because she “had fear of retribution” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking to renew the proceedings because the alleged incident is still traumatised.
Ronalda, at the time of the assault, bought him for 100 million euros by the famous Italian club Juve from the transfer to the Real Madrid club from Manchester United this summer.
Brexit: United Kingdom will forever regret the losses of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will forever regret”, if after Brexit loses its status as world leader in the production of cars, the secretary of Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘concerning’ that Toyota UK had communicated to the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would have temporarily stopped manufacturing at Burnaston, near Derby.
"The deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automobile stated that the impact of late at the border in the event of an agreement on Brexit not being concluded can be cost jobs.
In a race in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are produced – nearly 150 000 cars produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen a halt in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda cars, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement with regard to the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that it will close its Mini car manufacturing plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers call a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of "in-time delivery", with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being delivered to cars produced for order in 37 minutes.
If Britain had left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be an disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to have a company at a warehouse for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, and thus a halt in production would have occurred.
Mr Clark stated that Theresa May's plans to reinvigorate future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"We need a deal, we want to have the best business that will allow, as I say, not only current success, but also grasp this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long term it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade unions, said that they are increasingly concerned about the union: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
The speaker of the government said: “We have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "another week off" because he continued to fight for the post of the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is on the job of a special council by Robert Mueller, who examines interventions in the Russian elections, ties between Trump's branchmen and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Whatever Trump releases the acting general agent and threatens Mueller's independence, the Washington cages have been on its way for months.
At the beginning of this month, the daily New York Times stated that Rosenstein discussed carrying cameras to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of seizing the President through 25.
Rosenstein denied the message.
Last Monday, however, he came to the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein would not let go, but then the meeting was delayed so that she would not be able to hear from the Senate's judicial committee, where the Witness statements of Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI a weekly investigation of the accusation against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sundays on Fox Channel.
When asking for an appointment with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not set date, it may be this week, so it may be necessary to move for another week with everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always tell the news to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
The host of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by aversion to television reporters' "twenties" although she said: "I do not agree with the fact that they will perform."
She subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would grow.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," he added without stating evidence. "We looked at those numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and there's gonna be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior representatives.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre view of the gathered reporters.
Health Minister reports to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wishes to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman's MSP sent a letter not six months before the leaving of Great Britain in the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to settle the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “There has been a continuing meeting between the great Britain and the EU over the summer, leading to the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government also takes steps in preparing for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and outside it bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are useful for both patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warm wish to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The stoned defender Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie stepped up an emergency surgical procedure after suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from the opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put Abercrombie on the sideline oxygen and then put him on the stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
The shareholder of Tennessee told Chrisz Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had performed a surgical procedure at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are not yet “no details of the type/extension of the injury” and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the red shirt, attends the first season for the state Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
The foreign buyer will be charged higher property tax when he buys real estate in the UK, with money being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move, which aims to attract young voters
Increasing the requirement for higher property taxes will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
It is expected to raise the Treasury by £ 120 million annually – to help people without home
Buyers from abroad will pay higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they purchase real estate in Great Britain, while money will also be used to help people without homes, they will today announce Theresa May.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success in attracting young voters with an oath to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increased tax on the purchase of real estate will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while money will further strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleeping without roofs above their head.
An addition to the current requirement for real estate tax payments, including higher levels introduced two years ago, for second homes and purchase for rent, may reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the Treasury will increase by up to £ 120 million a year.
The estimates say that the newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of the citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which drive prices and make it difficult for those who buy for the first time to get home on the ladders.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become the “city of spirits” just because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
New principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a reduction in real estate purchases tax to help more young people to own their own home.
He accused big construction companies of holding property prices high by taking the land, but they did not use it, and he insisted on Mrs. May to withdraw the quota from the affordable houses to repair the “neutive home” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced by the excuse of a number of housing reforms proposed, including the management of rents and the termination of “uncertain” evictions.
He also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
May said: “I have said last year that I want to give my efforts as Prime Ministers to restore the British Dream – so that each new generation has a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be right that it is easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as for working residents of Great Britain.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the sweatiness of sleeping without a roof above your head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland."
The leader of Sunderland Jack Ross states that he is his “most ambitious” at a certain stage manager in Scotland.
42-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of renovating the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he went to the Stadium of Light after he led St Mirren back the league of Scottish Premiership in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country like a player.
I got rank B and it was," said Ross on the BBC Scotland's Sportsund.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my father when I was a child, and that is always something that brings me back.
But this would only come if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety from following the names that were in place in such a big club when he refused the premiers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“A rush would be to me at that time to see if I could get this club back to Premier League.
The structure and equipment of this club undoubtedly belongs to Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I think I'd be successful if I could put the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge of his career for three years, and before that, he had served as an auxiliary chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as coach of Hearts.
Then the Alloa Club helped recover from the retreat to the third group and transform St Mirren from falling to the winner of the title of the champions immediately in the following season.
And Ross says he's got a much better feeling now than he's ever had at his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlecool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
“It was probably a real crucifixion,” recalls Alloa.
“I truly believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I was good, and it made good money and had a reasonable height.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I keep going through them in terms of stress and pressure on the job, but I just feel good at management.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I do, I feel that now I feel the most in my entire adult life in my skin."

Research found that the great time on the pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
Numbers show that groups of pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultation firm, who produced the final report, stated: “A stable sunlight and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar formula as last June, when the pub increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
In June the restaurant dropped by 1.8 percent worse in June.
Hospody and bars attracting drinks have so far been as hard as the restaurants have worsened.
Hospodes whose main markets are made of food, also suffered by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analytical company of leisure activities, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that lasts April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing cost pressures.
A long, hot summer cannot be a worse time for food business operators and a time to tell whether the milder temperatures we have experienced in August will bring so much needed relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Caffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is the industrial scale introduced in the industry.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents
Every fifth child – only 11 years old – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators shows research
Research between 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false instagram pages"
Reports raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account of which parents know about.
Every fifth child, at only 11 years old, creates social networks that are hidden from their parents.
The study between 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” in which photographs share.
Reports show concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students have reported that they have an impeccable “main” account that their parents know about, and at the same time have a private account.
A mother who ran into a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found that her teenager urged others to “suicide.”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistress Conferences (HMC) of Independent Schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, while half admit that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that he has so many teenagers temptation to create online premises where their parents and educators cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athle Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inefficient director at the annual meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light atlet and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sports like those for whom her far-reaching experience at international level will be useful in the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are sure that for athletes in Scotland it will be very beneficial if he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be a vote of athletes, and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 at 200 and 400 metres, won a total of four gold medals and now is a regular expert of the BBC, could not walk after the transiting ischemic at the time.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's time for me to see if I could get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've proven full recovery, learned to walk again, and I'm doing exercise today!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!"
Milk remover bringing the matching of mothers to cows share opinions online
The company with the production of vacuum cleaners divided online opinion by advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of placing on the market the "first quiet carrier vacuum cleaners in the world" company with consumer technologies, Envi released a music video with an overlay showing the freedom that the new vacuum is giving to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows with a song that says, "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail," and "If you haven't noticed that I don't have a veggie, my boobs are here."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, feed my milk.”
An advertisement that was published on the corporate Facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and he received mixed reactions from those who saw him, and many of them indicated that it casts light on the “horry” of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows for advertising for this product.
Like us, she must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
The Elvie vacuum cleaner is discreetly attached to the nursing breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Scientiously traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise for the mother's breast pump they keep their children?"
Someone else added: "This ad is completely out of order."
There were also those who defended advertising, while one woman admitted that the song was “infectious”.
“ I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I was still breast-feeding.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's a big deal.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck their milk (time at work or toilet) and feel like “the cows”.
It's not an ad to praise or lose the dairy industry."
At the end of the video shows a group of women that they all dance with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under their bra.
The campaign concept is based on observation that a lot of women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
The vacuum cleaner Elvie, however, is absolutely quiet, has no wires or hoses and beautifully hides into breast-feeding bras, so women give freedom of movement, the possibility to hold a child and even when they do walk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECC for mothers, added a comment: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative placing on the market.
By creating parallels between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point to milk removal and all the challenges associated with it, showing a fun and reliable feeling of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner got on the air.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who had just used the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to the state camp at the Texas border
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, especially because the tough rhetoric and principles of the Trump administration introduced have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the accompanying people were traditionally made up of immigrants without evidence, who were afraid of threatening to stay in the country, so they claimed to be a child.
The risk rose in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenc, a senior officer in the immigration and customs department, testified to Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who applied for escort status for minors alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the suspects had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the home sponsors are illegally in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So let's continue their prosecution," said Mr. Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives in an effort to work more quickly on child matters have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear before the court within a month before the detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot will appear through a call within a video conference instead of personally stating their case as legal status for the immigration judge.
Those who, according to the judgement, are not entitled to help will be quickly deported.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he will experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to explosions of anger or attempts to escape, say asylum workers and report to the system within the last few months.
The lawyers say that these concerns are increased in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is more likely not to notice, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a state camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many children are already fighting.
Syria has announced that they have American, French and Turkish “occupational ingredients” immediately download
During the speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mual also called after the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, although there is already an eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also a representative prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “this will be imposed.”
"It must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
He insisted that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 30,000 people killed since 2011 and millions of others lost their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "a battle in this holy battle until we have rid of all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
The United States have 2,000 units in Syria, which mainly train Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of the war-sustained country.
When handing out refugees Moualem declared that they were good conditions for return and accused “some Western countries” of “progression of unreasonable fears” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called on international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They regret what a purely humanitarian matter should be."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last attack of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
Russia-Turkish Agreement has prevented the great attack of Syrian forces in Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Moual pointed out that the agreement had “reasonably given deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military procedure would focus on jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, with binding on Al-Qaedu, who would “be exterminated.”
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meeting of the new Committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way towards elections.
Moualm set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, with the word that the panel's work should be limited to the control of the articles of the existing constitution and gave a warning against the action.
Why Trump will win even in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win in other elections in 2020 if, as likely, a lot of liberal observers, prosecutions and scandals had not been completed before his office as president.
In this case, this would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue of the watchers.
Since 2014, the follow-up in the main broadcast time has more than doubled to 1,05 million to CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average track record of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago according to Nielsen's agency and “The Rachel Maddow Show” to MSNBC increased the ratings to cable TV on 3.5 million watching the main night messages.
“It’s a light that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Survival” show at the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, experienced comedy author and program “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sleeping Into the Hollywood Boys” Club,” has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before his election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "Because he's funny," said Mrs. Scovell.
It's a meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of the Washington future of Roe v. Wade could reconnect with immigrants' families and for the benefit of the global economy.
Cooling is a luxury that can only afford the most primitive watchers.
And yet, it goes beyond whether you are informed by a citizen when you are six hours watching a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," dog-skinned Paul Manafort jackets worth $15,000 ("an arrogance blanching" as Washington Post) and the consequences of the gross depiction of Mr. Trumpa Storm Daniels.
Among other things, I will not look again at Super Maria in the same way.

He couldn't resist, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing up to the Senate Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people said: “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outbound money goes to the most funniful domestic races in the medium term
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing the influx of finance due to the reorganization of congress districts that generated two office owners in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the re-opening of the city district of Pittsburgh by the interim Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – which won another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another owner of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is deeply overlapped with the new 17.
After the highest Pensylvan Court delivered in January the opinion that the old districts were continuously divided in favour of Republicans, maps were redesigned.
The race in the new 17th district started with a sharp financial separation between financial branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaig Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the followed March special elections until the 18th congress district.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for decades and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give the Democrats a little lead.
America considers fine Salvador to be China's support, then resigns.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated at a hotel in Panama until the partners courtfully moved the Trump management team.
The representatives of the State Department decided not to recognise Taiwan," said the Deputy Minister Heather Nauert in the statement issued earlier in the month.
But fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included short-term financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of painful murders.
North American and Central American representatives of the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following similar negotiations from the previous year, which were seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants heading to the US.
By mid-September, however, the leaders explained that they wanted to continue to negotiate and effectively conclude any fines considered for Salvador.
The Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal by the administration in the negotiations, said diplomats.
And three American ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new unobtrusive news from Washington.
spokesperson of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government executive and also spoke on anonymity condition.
Study History
A definite nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible prevention of Mr. Trump's law enforcement, which is now in public record a lot of evidence.
Mr Mueller, in his investigation, is allegedly turning to see if Mr Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have had to be held accountable to this body, just as he was preparing to re-enter the voter, and eventually he would probably have been expected to be a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "if" and I do not want to argue that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to organize a coup against Hitler, just enough to build the Western Powers and support them in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid long years of bloodshed, which followed.
History revolves around these critical moments that speed up or slow down the unspeakable course of democracy.
Americans now stand before some similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do, if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who runs Mr. Mueller's fate of investigation?
Rosenstein had been attacked ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the President last year and speculating that he was not in a state of health in order to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times are inconclusive.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or what if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the convincing accusation of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, are we voting in the middle of a term of office for Congress, which will be held by Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we do not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and about 60 years later, she sent me torch the candles on a table with a saviour.
How could I not be so optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about dealing with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday host Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Rakušany would give them a great chance in Spain's field of Villarreal earlier this month to follow the G Group of the European League.
The damage to his knees prevented Graham Dorrans from starting to appear on the field for the first time in the season until it was 2-2 with Villarreal. However, they believe that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge to a bigger thing.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," said 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with faith that we could take something away, and we took the point.
We may have reproduced it at the end, but, overall, it was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but in the second half, we improved and we were better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last game, they played a good result.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team's strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, and training's nice, too.
I hope we can get into this right now, throw the last season behind us, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about saving money
Even though the participants had a clear idea of how it should be taken care of, few people talked about it with their family members.
In fact, half of the people in the national study said that she and her partner were discussing the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want them to be taken care of by a family member, but they do not agree to discuss it with him” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of a national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how to take care because these factors can play a big role in determining prices.
Adopt your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care can, for example, be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance – as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as long as you can.
Determine a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes, unless you can communicate yourself.
Consider also the full writing of power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not qualify for this.
Remember the details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergy?
Write these details into the written plan to make you ready.
“In the game are not only finances, but, for example, what are the names of the treating physicians?” says Martin.
“ Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready for you."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Pala on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala Regent, which is a region north of Pala, which is closer to the epicentre of 7.5 degrees earthquake.
After the crash, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donggala regents on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Middle Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regenty stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the administrative region under the province had a population of 299 200.
The main components of the economics of the Middle Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The province also has significant nickel mining, which, however, focuses mainly in Morjali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Dutch organization, Disaster Mitigation Agency has already hit the tsunami several times for the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami hit the west of Donggala even in 1996 when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic pacific Fire Circle, and there is an earthquake on a regular basis.
Here's a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: The large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that hit 14 countries and prepared for the life of 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: The series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the Sumatra coast.
2006: The 6,8 degree Earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most beautiful island of Java and caused the tsunami to hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6th degree Earthquake hit near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people have lost their lives.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra and caused tsunamis of a height of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake hit Pidie Jay's regent in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic because people were reminded of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was formed, but over 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
Earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin lived in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, abuse of domestic violence reports and prevention of arrest.
According to the police report, when his female friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her on the phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility facility and is held for an unprotected $500 bond, reports KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared in a court of law on Saturday, where he said that he felt “exceptly innocent” when he was asked to comment.
Palin faces three class A transgressions, which means he could be sentenced up to USD 250 000 per year and fined down to USD 250 000.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B breach, punishing himself with one-day prison and fine $2000.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face with a criminal report.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The reported attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaskan court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violation of the report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of hallucinations in conjunction with the incident.
Apparently hit his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of war veterans in 2016, when her son's violent behavior associated with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by a son service in Iraq.
Indian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead

The 7.5 degree earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electrical and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days, the numbers of victims are expected to rise.
The earthquake hit directly on the dawning part of the island of Sulawesi, located north-east of Jakarta's Indonesian capital.
In social media, video showing a moment of disaster appeared.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Pala when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York want a death penalty for Sayfulla Sappov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Sappov, 30, reportedly in October, launched an attack on a bike along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan district using a leased Home Depot truck, which took off pedestrians and bikers.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sappov killed eight victims “inadvertently” and caused a series of injuries – thus defining the conditions of intent to give death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to judicial documents, both figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 crimes, including, for example, murder charges for extortion, which normally federal prosecutors use in cases of organized crime, and assault charges and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “sign planning and preparation”, claiming to the plaintiffs and describing the manner in which Saipov’s act was carried out, such as gross, cruel and perverted.”
“Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijová, Hernan Ferruti, Hernan Diega Mendozy and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucci,” listed in his intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York's last death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
Last time, the death penalty was actually executed in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, which was proved to be a conspiracy in order to espionage the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated minimal regret within days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired to commit an attack by monitoring the video of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also announced that he also called for the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the Sappoved, said that they were “caughtily disappointed” by the decision of the plaintiffs.
“We believe that the decision to require death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and condemning life without being released will only prolong trauma from these events for everyone involved” said Patton.
A team of Sappov's attorneys had already asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members of the Konzervative Party, negotiations on the Brexit of NIGEL FARAGE should be held.
Nigel Farage committed himself to mobilize the people's army during today's protest at the Konzervative Party conference."
The former Head of the Parties to the independence of the United Kingdom stated that politicians must , feel pressure” from the Eurosceptics – as one of their own Members of Theresa May proposed, should lead the negotiations with the EU precisely him.
The Greek conservative Member, Peter Bone, declared that Britain would already be out at the march in Birmingham, if he were Mr Farage's secretary to Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing during the reconciliation of his ranks, where there is a deep split, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for their perseverance in the EU, who have joined the separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan under the attacks of Brexit advocates, supporters of the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist on continuing to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its ,chaos.”
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to leave on Chequers.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would be out today," he said.
Member of Wellingborough added: ,I will stand up for Brexit, but we must cough up on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight the world war to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The message that British citizens would change their minds and want to hold back is absolutely remarkable."
Konzervative Deputy of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, said to the reporters: , I am saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they do not like him members of our party or our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Mrs May, he says: 'Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must, inadequate situations’, if they wish to betray their decisions taken on the basis of a 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you."
In the report excited crowd added: ,I want our political class to feel the pressure on the edge of Brexit's injury.
"We now mobilise an army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain that rules on our own."
In the meantime, the Union’s supporters marched through Birmingham and then arranged a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had a transparency of the Consumers against Brexit after the weekend's start of the party's operation.
The Labour MP Lord Adonis was mocking conservatives because of the security problems of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
,These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for a troubleless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"Celé is a farce."
There is nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to think about the presidential candidate
American Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections she would “think the candidate for president in order.”
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at the City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the time critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-elect against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall from the moment Trump sat down at the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, which means even the woman in the highest place.

Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in the morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which was not incompatible with his life," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through the web 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his boyfriend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was heard and admitted to moving at the scene, had a gun, and also admitted the shooting of Wayde Sims.
The Simpson was shaken without incidents and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great Prize Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion when the team director played a victory over Sebastian Vettel
Right away, when Valteri Bottas ended up in Saturday's qualification in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the team director Mercedes would play a big part in the race.
He had a good start from the position field and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he prevented his position and invited Vitella to attack the teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with cars moving on to the group's willingness, which should be decisive.
The rider of the Mercedes went into the depa by later and after the exit he went to Vettel. However, Hamilton went out towards the front and in a tight fight had to leave the Ferrari rider undaily the inner path free to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen came out of the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was on his 21st birthday in the lead.
He then led the big part of the race because he kept the original tires as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could tie Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually drove into the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday Assembly because she insisted that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with accusations from the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh with sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford's statement to the Senate Court, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and detestable and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that happened the last days of Sennare when you see the anger when you see those people, how angry and angry and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the edition and publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get the leak?
Remember her answer... you published that document -- oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
No, that's not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent a Ford letter with details of the accusation against Kavanaugh in July and the information disappeared at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, nor did I disclose the case," said Mr. Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
But apparently, her words did not believe the president, who expressed his view of the case at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this is a really bad word of the body.
She may not have done it, but anyway it's the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, the three women accused of sexual harassment, suggesting that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take the power back to any available means.
You see, the floor, the abomination, is no matter who they hurt, who needs to smite into the ground, to get back to power and the corridor," said Mediaite the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed the Friday lose in Elite League against Belfast Giants a win on Saturday's wedding in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took on two-point lead, thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauville's interventions.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for domestic settlement before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared for Dundee again, while two gates of Lukas Lundvalda Nielsena had secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to beat 2-1 on Friday at Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met in the season four times, and all three previous games were controlled by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, 3:35, for Kendal McFaulla's assist, while David Rutherford assigned an assist to Beauville's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared at the time of 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin on the first break, but only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The house was regrouped, and Bouchard was once again able to balance the goal from the barbed game at the time of 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped in the second third of Nielsen for the first time in the match to turn the lead to Dundee and the same player insured the lead of his team in the middle of the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people aboard a plane to escape earthquakes
Air traffic leader in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he perished when he watched over to manage to fly hundreds of people on board safely to fly.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after, on Friday, Sulawesi was shaken by a great earthquake caused by tsunami.
The massive aftershocks flooded the area, and many people remained imprisoned in the ruins of the city of Pala.
But despite the fact that fellow 21-year-old Anthonise Gunanwan Agung was running to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly-distorted control tower at Mutiar Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He stayed in his position to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time in the runway, can take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait spokesperson, said to the Australia ABC News television channel that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantan, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed their concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management indicated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase, because many bodies still remain unscrupulous and many of them still have not been preserved," said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the devasted Pala have reached a height of up to six metres, and mass funerals will take place on Sundays.
Military and civilian aircraft shall be transported to affected areas of assistance and supply.
Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “There are minutes of ambulance bringing more bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small stores are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we do not know what they actually find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
The Indonesian President Yoko Widodo came to Pala on Sunday and told the country’s military files: “I ask you to work day and night and finish all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with more than 550 people killed.
Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that crashed in the lagoon on one of the micron islands in Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, indicating at first that all passengers and crew reading a total of 47 were safely evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini, in the press release, stated that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find one passenger man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators looking for a missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for providing details of such passengers, their age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials claimed that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in nursing care on Saturdays and were all in a stable state.
However, what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. airline and Navy have reported that the plane was landing in the lagoon before the runway arrived.
Some Witnesses thought the plane ran over.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very small height.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that, together with the others, he managed to get water deep into the emergency exits of the plane diving.
He also stated that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he himself suffered a light head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors who worked near on the docking of the port pier helped rescue using an inflatable boat that was transported by passengers to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The information from Aviation Safety Network states that during the last two decades, a total of 111 persons died in aircraft accidents with the PNG registration mark, but no accident occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analytical describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended its speech in this case, in which the man is repeatedly tried from burning a woman alive in the State of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department has been testifying for several hours in its personal analyst Paul Rowlett and has provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst wrote a script using the phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several cell phones, which showed that Tellis was in violation of his previous statement at the night of her death in Chambers, a letter from The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile phone data showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he realized he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford was courted in the sobor, testifying that the day in question was not in the city.
When the plaintiff asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "besides because my car was in Nashville that night."
The next accident was that Tellis mentioned that he knew Chambers about two weeks after the day she died.
However, the cell phone records say those two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett stated that after the death of Chambers Tellis, he deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her entirely from his life,” said Hale.
The defence will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to come before the jury later on the same day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions on this genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed band in Bristol claims that hip hop has shifted from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They therefore want to go back to the roots and repopulate the knowledgeable hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have already met with reanimation in recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black girl?
The teacher from NY sues a few for his outcast for his “racistic” text message
A native in New York sues a few for her discriminatory exterminations after having received an mistakenly sent text message from the mother in whom she was designated as “another black woman” text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared the lawsuit to "retribution."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay when the first day of work in 2016 found out that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NEEÉÉÉÉÉ, DALCHÍ češka” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in her text report.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman had fired Mrs. Maurice and said that she had just left her tutor, who was African-American, worked really badly, and that instead she had been expecting the Philippines, she wrote a letter from New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received a salary for one job, and Uber was sent home.
Now Maurice's suing a couple of people to compensate for getting out of work and asking for damages to USD 350 per day of six months' engagement, for which she was hired at the outset, even if without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done," said Post this Friday and added: "I know that's discrimination."
But the two returned to strike as not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was appropriate measures because they feared that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco of Post.
“ But would you put your child in the hands of someone you treated grossly, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "retribution" and said that his wife was caring for only two months of age and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You guys would ride someone like that?
This is not a nice thing," the investment banker said.
Although it still persists, a jury on social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not recover from the talking bear, showing the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time, before publication.
It is very fun to know now that we know the tremendous success of the Mededton."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write children's books on a small stuffed bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, she added on the 60th anniversary of the book publication, which became a “sweetie” stream after his death last year.
Paddington, whom he describes as “a very important member of her family,” added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was never grazy,” she said.
“ But because Paddington was such a real figure to him, it was like having a child who achieved something that you could really be proud of.
I believe Paddington's success looked at this look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to assign all the successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rapidly transported to Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me on a regular basis to tell me that this is really bad and that he does not expect to get out of it” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I had a call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in two more minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to just keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now a grieving loss of her daughter, joined the plane along with other passengers, without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“ I held my head down, tears flowed all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much power he loved her."
Trusting women are sending postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys broadcast postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can search for support.
Tyler Davis' son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, he took his life in 18 years.
"I would not want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydia, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left his work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found an unmovable body of his sibling after he married his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I'm worried about how it'll affect his life.
Mrs Davis proposed postcards “to inform people that they have available people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don't hold the locks - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' summer girlfriend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing,” he explains.
“ We observed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
The worst was Christmas day -- when the kids opened gifts, they didn't even look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma to them, but that it must go through with it: “This thing in the family can do a complete hole.
It ripped us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that we could get something that was actually asked for – a limited-scale investigation of time – we could bring a little unity into it," said Mr Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the Committee would “fall” because both parties would bury themselves in acquired positions.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to lead badly, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in the attempts to enforce the required man for post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbied with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and him through his encounter with his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI builds up their message?
The Senate will vote on this, and today there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm with the Supreme Court.
Numbers of North Korea refugees "declared" by Kim
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has declined since the beginning of the government of Kim Chong-Un seven years ago, claiming the South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, quoted data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, stated that 1127 escapes took place in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there is more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smugglers required at the border.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements about it.
The great majority of North refugees today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and it is easier to cross it than in the heavily protected delimitated zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South – which are technically still in war – has been significantly improved in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met at Pyongyang to talks that focused on the stopped de-declaration negotiations.
This occurred in the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US that there was no progress in the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we can unarm ourselves," said Mr Ri in the speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and stated that he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this remark in Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but if any woman ever performed such a theater would call it “hysteric”, Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh Thursday's announcement before the Senate Court.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both still in the teenage age.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screamed and suffocated when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats within the committee and stated that their accusations against him were “a threat and coordinated attack” by organised liberals who could not carry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that she was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he himself disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned into the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi replied negatively to the question whether she would attempt Kavanaugh's appeal in the case of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received most of the representatives in the House.
"I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is working now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential proceeds of Kavanaugh in a court of acceptable care or Roe vs. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the course of hearings prior to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of whether he would rebut some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a hysteric person to join the court and expect us to say, “Jéje, that is wonderful” said Pelosi.
And women must rule it.
She couldn't get rid of it without crying after her words, months, and years of rain.
“We run when we have anger,” Mrs Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “My wife, who was somewhere the principal, helped me, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she created some technique, and she said to me that when she was angry and she started crying, she said to the person with whom she spoke: “You may think I was crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And that's how she continued.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are incomprehensible.
One of my life's memories comes from the first job that I worked at the office where men dominate. I once expressed my irreplaceable rage with crying but older, always cool manager, who I always feared a little bit, caught me at the neck and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Do not ever show them that you are crying” she told me.
“They don’t know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, a once democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarriage affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," she said to me after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Because at that time, the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to keep up with the contribution and so has committed itself to not going into the match if it does not obtain a $2 million contribution.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of the supporters who would give it USD 1000 to a male candidate would give it USD 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it harder to raise money and focus on voters rather than on delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocated by anger.
"Maybe you would think that I was nervous about it," said Mrs Schroeder about how the press responded to it.
“And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my tombstone.
"Small"?
Why Chinese-American Trade War for Beijing can be good
The initial balance of trade wars between the US and China was deafening and although the battle was far from being fought, according to experts among the countries to be marketplaces in the long term, favourable to Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the USA, provided the first warning this year by passing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs were announced concerning goods for USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which practically means taxation of half trade exports from China to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, with the most recent imposition of tariff tariffs of five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of US goods.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel in its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to its original tracks, that would mean that it would be humiliating for the Chinese President Si Jiin-Pinching to comply with the US requirements.
Nevertheless, experts think that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term as it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that fast political decisions by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic hole in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have allowed to do so," said Abigail Grace, research co-worker, who focuses on Asia in think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country made more than a seven-year war.
When speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister Walid al-Mual said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in the territory today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorists into normal state.
Now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a country in devastation.
However, he stressed that he would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe responded to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Evria won at Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The US has now lost six in a European soil. It has not been winning Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and her team reached 14.5 points that were needed for defeating the US.
Star U.S.A., Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then shot the ball into the water at 3 pairs of 16 holes and let Francesco Molinarim win.
The Italian golfer Molinari then lit up all his bikes and became one of the 4 players and reached the best result of 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 player of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The highest rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated from his latest Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the overall best European player with 25,5 points earned for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was just a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad I could help," said Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He gave a cup to his cousin John Ramp, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 on Sunday in singles.
"I feel the incredible pride of beating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said Rahm 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 greatest titles, which can compare only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend in an effort to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
After the unsatisfying results of his team, Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these boys, really fought.
We really warmed Europe by the heart this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm putting my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like the 12 guys. I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to get down.
You played us."
Updates on Red Influence: The concentration is reduced during the Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota periods.
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decrease in Tampa Bay red tide levels.
According to FWC, flowering water stains are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, indicating a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of approximately 130 miles along the coast from the north of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The shells were observed about 10 miles from the coast in the Hillsborough district, but last week it was relatively fewer seats.
The red tide was also observed during the Pasco period.
The central concentration on the coast or on the high seas of Pinellas was reported last week.
