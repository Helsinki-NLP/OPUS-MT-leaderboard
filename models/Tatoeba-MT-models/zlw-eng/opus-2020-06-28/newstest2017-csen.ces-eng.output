Eight-year-old chef found a dead man in a shop in San Francisco
The eight-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco recently was the steps of local trade this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: “He has finally begun to succeed. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall was identified as an eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia on Wednesday morning, said the medical examiner's office.
The Sanfrancian police department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is being conducted.
The brother of Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who had previously been a rank chef in Boston, gained his dream job as chef at Sons & Daughters' restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson at Sons & Daughters said that his death was “crowded and destroyed. ”
"We have a small team working as a closely connected family, and we will miss them very much," said the spokesperson.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was first sleeping in the hostels, but that recently “it was finally starting to work out with him.”
"He found an apartment, walked with a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think of who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to reach out to his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia told us.
He never wanted to participate in any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unscrupulous diamond that blinded every day”, he said.

Czech railways have invested over 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, a state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion to modernise vehicles.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in the various years, except for 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Czech railways have invested in modernization of vehicles over CZK 31 billion in the last six years.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The larger part of the investment gave the carrier to regional transport, which was about 60 percent of the money, then 40 percent of the company invested in the refurbishment of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average old locomotives and units are currently 19 years old.
The upgraded older vehicles are however counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles did not count, average age of driving vehicles of the Czech Republic would increase by 10 years.
A little older are on average passenger wagons whose average age is 23 years when modernization is started.
If only age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
Classic sets consisting of wagons and drawn locomotives, however, in recent years both Czech and global railways gradually disappear and are mounted by motor or electric units.
The number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year decreased by 280 units between 2011 and 2015.
In particular, the carrier has been removed from old vehicles equipped with cot seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles disembarked.
From the investments planned for the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to place on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic speed line.
The contract calculates the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities of the fourth year know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless. They admit it.
For the fourth quarter of the year the online editor of the daily News.cz has been watching the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is a touristly interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
The highway administrators know it's in black, but they say nothing can do about it.
There are hundreds of commercials all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to the officials, there is a misguided law on the blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
They're needed first by a complicated bureaucratic wheel.
Meanwhile, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just have to move the commercial by a few meters, and the official process has to start over.
Road directorship and highways four years ago admitted: our land on Lipno stands at the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno, near the state road advertising billboard in black.
For three months, however, officials were not enough to dispose of unauthorised portable structures with giant advertising posters.
It's like no one minded that they're standing right next to the truck, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road administrators say that billboards cannot easily deal with the horrific law because of the horrific law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We must not afford that," says the spokesperson of the Management of the Road and the motorway Nina Ledvin, referring to the difficult bureaucratic wheel that must be preceded by the billboard removal.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began the online journal Update.cz closely watching in spring, is not unique yet pointing to a general problem that cannot be tackled by states and authorities effectively and quickly.
In the southern Bohemia alone, tens of similar mobile advertising were counted against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are others on the same page.
"We are in trouble by the company to remove the strings," confirms the director of the Department of Transport of the Czechoslovak Regional Office Jiří Klás, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klása, there is a terrible law on the blame that binds officials.
First of all, the billboard owner has to spell out to give the ad away.
However, the company's bosses are often inconspicuous or know the finale that has already been described in the past when it became more detailed about the issue: just mobile stand with advertising move by a few meters and officials can give the previous call to remove the black ink into the basket.
That's because the Authority has to determine exactly where illegal billboard costs.
"If someone does not agree with it at all, he looks at it as a new device and we must address the owners again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have brought a new law, which since September next year would ban billboards on motorways and limit them even at I. class roads.
Criticians point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertising remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't get so cured.
Companies can continue to make tens of up to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on rents of illegal areas, and no one can.
For example, a billboard lured on Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
The officials know it well: the Czech-Republic magistrate with it currently leads three administrative proceedings for the blackly built billboards.
There's a three-thousand fine in every procedure.
This is more advertising that has been placed in class I protection zone without authorisation.
Driving has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of the Department of Transport of the Czechoslovak Magistrate.
Advertising, which is currently.cz interested in, although not yet configured, will soon be most likely added to these cases.
According to spokesperson ŘSD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would thus reach the regional table and then probably the masters.
Comerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She does not take over the post and the official seat on Žižkov has canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company was attended by a South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was known for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers them to advertisers, but in the past refused any connection.
This spring, when the RSD started at the initiative of News.cz, interested in advertising at Lipno, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where allegedly the new company is based.
Even from this address, however, no one has spoken to the administrators of the motorways today.
A futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in the seat are not uncommon.
One company, a few years ago, we gradually gave fines for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the ID number, and there was nothing to deal with.
The editor returned the case, the ads continued, maybe in other places.
We are strong enough against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits, on condition of anonymity, one of the officials.
No one is speaking about the law yet in this respect.
Currently.cz spoke with several Members who took the problem.
But they haven't done anything yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the term for maintaining billboards on the main Czech communications.
The government denied it.
Billboards are very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic for both national and regional politicians.
On the one hand, they know about social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them for advertising in electoral campaigns themselves.
I don't stop the relatively established impression that if something doesn't work, we need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapes and poppy, estimate statistics.
According to estimates from the Czech Statistical Office, cereal harvest will be 6,7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet, this year's crops have exceeded the average for the past five and ten years.

This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15th.
The original estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth decline against last year.
The harvest harvest of cereals, but it was above average.
This year's crops have exceeded their average over the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, it will be higher this year the harvest of rape and poppy.
The growers will harvest about 3,9 percent more than a year ago, when they received under a roof of 1,256 million tonnes.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in cereal production is due to both a reduction in hectares of yield by 3.7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the seed area.
Farmers will donate three percent less fields this year.
Ozimé wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year, according to the estimate.
Farmers were using it on more fields.
However, a lower hake yield shall be signed which falls to 6.04 tonnes.
The fifth decline in statistics is expected to be the most commonly used for the production of beer.
With the reduction of crops, it costs a reduction of 15.2 percent but also a lower hake yield.
The cold barley will, on the contrary, be born by 6.3 percent more.
It also grows the harvesting of the rye.
The crop of rape statistics estimated 1.305 million tons, which is more against last year.
The Osalonian area has spread by 7.3 percent.
But the Hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of rape exceeds a decade's average of 13.3 percent, while the feast is one third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, also the poppy fields are coming.
This year, farmers planted it at 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when poppy grew on record 70 000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it is half-field.
This year, thanks to the expansion of the oatmeal surfaces, the poppy harvest will be richer.
A match against last year by 2.5 percent at 27,423 tonnes.
But the Hektar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The Olomouc police charged two men with a knife and a machete, sent them to custody.
The police charged two assailants who attacked a knife on Tuesday at the city center of Olomouc and a female female female female with a 25-year-old husband.
"Even though the defendant tried to escape, they caused a seductive and cut injury that required treatment in the hospital and other treatment," said the police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by police officers.
The applicant filed a motion for court to take them into custody and gave him permission on Friday.
Both men are threatened with three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detained from assault by a 25-year-old man in the heart of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him a fine and cut injury, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, who became the police on Tuesday at the right noon in the Svoboda class.
The perpetrators were in custody, informed by Olympic police spokesperson Marie Strrbáková.
A rough struggle between the two families took place in the garden space outside the Tratoria bar near the city center of Olomouc.
After the aggressive verbal dissolution, they attacked two attackers using knives and machetes of a 25-year-old man.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused a seductive and cut injury that required treatment at the hospital and further treatment, the police spokesperson said.
With a struggle that gave great attention in the city center, and for which several police guards and guards had to intervene on the spot, it was about family disputes.
The crime scene of a four - year - old man from Slovakia and a seven - year - old man from Olomouc was accused of trying to harm health and competition.
The applicant made a motion for a court order to take them into custody and to comply with the court on Friday, the spokesperson.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouc, during a mass battle by attackers also five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters further, before the discotété Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police then said that a group of about ten aliens with weapons attacked the guests of the company who stood before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two invaders with a conditional punishment.
An abandoned and empty house in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around every day.
One of the most loudest examples of the unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senovážní square.
She should've worked like a hotel by now.
Still nothing.
That you need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several active houses which, despite their location, size and often also monumental protection, are only empty and remove emptiness.
The property in the center was chosen by the project Emptyhouse.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, of transparent relationships between companies or of a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty houses are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
If the owners pay a special tax for them, they want an initiative.

My husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
Over a million dollars, they've given Clinton charity.
Most of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars-- is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
On Friday, American Democrats voted on Hillary Clinton's presidential office published its tax statements, increasing the pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, notified the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that the husbands of Clinton took a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a national and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43,2 percent of income.
However, Trump has a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish the tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, wrote Clinton on twitter a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton repeatedly returns to secret around Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims to have reported the AP agency.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who has been running for Vice President's post in the former lady's tandem, today published a report on his tax contributions in the last ten years.
With their wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and tax last year, they took 25.6 percent of their earnings.
In Nigeria, the defense broke again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccination and the doctors killed.
In Nigeria, children's defense cases have been reinstated.
In the north-east of the country, the government declared an extraordinary vaccination because there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccinations put the helicopters in there.
In the affected area were Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented vaccinations and doctors even killed.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there was an undetectable virus.
In the north-east of Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of children against defense will begin because there were two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that in the state of Borno, millions of children will be vaccinated and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters, according to the AP Agency, quickly imported vaccines against children's defense into the affected North-East part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus in the field has been inconspicuously collapsing for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past have prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to get into areas where children with defense were detected.
Both affected batholate came with refugees from the part of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
Head of the WHO Section responsible for disarming Michel Zaffran's defense station, the BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borno, Islamic radical group Boko Haram worked for a long time.
The area was made accessible to international organisations and to the government only early this year when Boko Haram succeeded in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of defense were a great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that it had been removed by the defense next year.
WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease did not show up for two years, it spread among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all the world's defense cases fell in Nigeria.
While the defense was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and North Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to the angry stories of fallen women.
Pope Frantisek met with 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope heard their difficult stories and called them to look for the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him.
Pope Frantisek met with 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were released from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church more than an hour had listened to the angry stories of fallen women and then called them to look for the future with confidence, said the speaker of the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes whom František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
They were all exposed to severe physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visitor wanted František to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him, he said to the Pope’s spokesperson.
František often draws attention to the fate of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, Syrian refugees came to Vatican this April and June due to his personal invitation.
France will hit the jihadites' factory.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't.
France has to help the Muslims themselves to combat radical Islamism.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ Government is about to prepare major changes in the functioning of the mosque and spiritual education.
We have closed 20 mosques and prayer since last December.
And the next will follow, the Minister announced the Home Secretary.
In the country, it works through a hundred jihadites.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who distort public freedom, France will be increasingly difficult to guarantee this religion of freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to make sure that in the mosques and prayers only the imams who were educated in France.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding the mosque from abroad.
Currently comes from abroad about 20 percent of the money to build new mosques, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the countries of the Gulf of Persia.
This is why preachers, who can sow radicalism in France, get into the mosque.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam now operates in the country, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The foundation was already to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But institutions soon hit internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It is a total failure," Valls said recently.
After the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the French political scene opened up a debate on a new institution, which will replace the non-functional foundation.
Other terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cezeneuve recently heard that the new foundation would already arise in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from home resources and also to oversee the names.
For the time being, it is not clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for different educational centres.
However, several proposals are considered.
One is a special fee or tax on hall food.
In practice, the sellers would pay the hall food for providing certification.
Some of this money would then travel to the Foundation's money.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (70 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who would go to Mecca.
Every year, there are about 30,000 of them on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
In the future, according to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have been through special educational programs at French universities should be present.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
Let's close the radical mosques.
The French government is at the same time in pursuit of radicals.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who talk hate in the mosques and respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, estimated to be about 2500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have spent some 80 imams and are considering it for several more tens.
Not everyone thinks that government action can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
It does not happen in mosques, young people radicalize on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert from the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Dear Brother Kelemen lost in the first round of sprint with the star Baugue.
The Czech motorbike biker must be killed by the progress to the eight-finals in repair driving.
The dear cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro following the procedure of sprint qualification among the best eighteen lost in the 1st round a fight with the French great Grigory Baugé, champion of silver from past games in London.
They have to fight about progressing through the eight-finals in the repair rides.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track 27 riders were built and the best Czech driver today wrote the 14th best time.
A two-card with a flight start was in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was therefore expected to be qualified by the fifth Baugé, who already had a bronze from Rio sprint.
Keremen, although at the conclusion, was looking forward to an experienced Frenchman, was the one who followed the procedure.
Great performance was the gold defender Jason Kenny.
Eighty-year-old Brit has taken the third fastest two hundred stories and qualifications he won the 9,551 Olympics.
He was able to consult with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy as expected.
It was also possible for the British Quartet in a lineup with Bradley Wiggins, which took place in the race's 4 km race to the new world record 3:50,570 and entered the final.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics improved by more than a second.
Young doctors press: They want fresh winds in the field
The representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute of a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full advice on supporting further sectoral events from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to solve the contract questions.
The young doctors and students of medicine in July voted against the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained “keep quiet” to the questions, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive body of the JDC vote decided to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to silence by the government today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board in order to approve the running programme of the successful sector events from the beginning of September.
Spor led young doctors this year to declare up to six strikes, including the first general strike in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr Johann Malavan, resigned following the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at meetings before the vote before 54 000 young doctors and students of medicine said that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for medical students in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Society of “Teachers”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Leaders Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to take their hands and announce the formal conclusion of eight months of the long vocabulary wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the luxury hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
There's been a hand pass, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely exude warmness from it, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly spoke of his "Dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm made the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that came out of Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: Shooting Russian combat aircraft Turkey on Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was raging back then.
Putin was handing out wounds around him and Ankaru accused of hitting a knife in the back of Moscow.
The worse was the greater it was that she had lost her supposed friend.
Once again, building real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has changed since December as well.
The state-controlled media led a massive global campaign against Ankara after months.
Suddenly, it looked like the Turks could for everything.
More serious was the accusation from top government officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this one strongly.
But in St Petersburg, the official news came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory too.
For Ankar, the benefits of the declaration of peace are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power last month during a failed puck and therefore needs all of his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey were visibly shaken.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which carry several million Russian tourists every year on the coast of Turkey.
This figure decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia, the tour of operators and charter companies is concerned, they will breathe here if it is possible to renew flights.
They earned maritime tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television has promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be re-exported.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vesmet newspaper.
However, the visit was of another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as what he considers to be a lame reaction to the attempt to coup.
In addition, the long-term impoverishment of long-term talks about EU entry and Putin's entry - which is eager to take advantage of cooling and to break Turkey's bond with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the chosen organs after trying to knock.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has deep-seated fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit at this pump, Russia's Border Palace and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described as "consistent society": how they combine forces of two countries that felt rejected and used by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are major differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood in the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even mentioned this question after almost three hours of opening discussions.
The Turkish President, with the intention of seeking answers to the question of differences between them, has decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement under which both States could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a member of NATO Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark should be repressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the banks.
She told them when she almost disappeared almost eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer finance.
They were behind it millions of pounds released for sponsoring international sport, from Six Nations ragby championship to Andy Marray's Winbledom Champion.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more away to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not run new stores.
All RBS references in England and Wales, except for headquarters and stock encoding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking, which get more ahead - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During travel to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered the questions Ross McEwan answered us.
BBC Scotland said: “The RBS band will stop being our investor brand and brand for which our employees work because we are now much more becoming a brand bank.”
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts aimed at the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual brands of sports sponsoring.
“It is a good time for us to move to the brand bank because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great customer bank and introduced these brands.
But along with our focus on customers' needs, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these signs of despair, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predilation led to target 3000. winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins.
Frankie Dettori, a 3000th victory in Newmarket in Britain on Friday.
This milestone has reached his second victory on his local track – the Predilation horse John Gosden.
Five-four-year-old Italian is a sixth-year-old jockey who has achieved such a result in plane chores.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of Dettori, who had won Ghayar’s horse, said: “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I'm extremely glad this happened in Newmarket, because right here 30 years ago, I stuck in Newmarket.
It's not a huge action, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when, after the victory, he brings Predilation.
Two jockeys of this milestone have reached the obstacles - the football champion Richard Johnson and 20 times the pension champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who led more than 4 300 winners during his careers breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it's not surprising that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fixture that distinguishes it from the other riders in the wall.
He is a fantastic ambassador of races, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only gone on weekends and big races, he would have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for a larger part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lively character, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famed summer jumper
From the summer finals to the summer run - Frankie Dettori was the delivery of two decals of British plane races.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
Inexpensive number of big race winners, including his famous "big sevens" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch due to drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a 6-month start ban, but he showed incredible internal power and all the doubters returned in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has already said that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released President of the President's Office Sergei Ivanova
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanova from the post of Presidential Office.
Ivanov has been one of the nearest Putin co-workers for many years.
Ivanov's threeties-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “released Ivanova from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanova's deputy since 2012.
Four-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat earlier.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that it was later the president of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your head of state within the meaning of the draft laws and control of how far your instructions are respected.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov asked for his release from the post and recommended that Vajno replace it.
Will they make smiles?
This step was completely mystifized by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest colleagues for a long time and as well as Putin worked for KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who sent out state television, both men said that the president's office's office's office was leaving at its own request.
But the smiles in the cameras have persuaded only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who once considered himself as a possible president is suddenly eager to lead the environmental policy of Russia has met with great distrust.
Kremlin’s pages quote the comments put to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very difficult post, even a problematic post, for four years.
As it seems, I've been the Head of the President's Office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At some point in time, Ivanov was even speculating to become a successor to Putin at the head of the state after his second term of office, because the third period would be counter-contamination for Putin.
However, this post took over another close to Putin’s associate Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the Presidential Office for just three and a half months later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the TV series, was released after the director hit.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of opinions on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS TV stations that produce the series are announced in the joint declaration of release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before notification of his fire.
There have been creative differences in the scene and I don't agree.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in his statement.
According to the ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson's character will disappear from a series that follows the stories of the FBI team a little later.
The 45 - year - old actor, who was famous for her main role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has worked in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I have loved Myself criminals, and in the last 12 years I have given hearts and souls to them," Gibson said in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be there until the end, but it won't be possible right now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and above all, to the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In the town of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be the sand eel that left the water at that point.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his finding on the channel of Periscope, thinking that someone could help to explain how some 5 centimetre fish got on his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connecting to Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have joined the North Land and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So this is the first of the four closures between the "plošin fairs", which are now almost finished around each of the three plons of the bridge.
Part of Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The project for £3.55 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project we all see how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge in an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and mass of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaductium and the platform bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place is now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now leaving in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: “The first closure in every bridge building is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
This is what we did through the north approach viaduct of 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to pull it up by about 3%.
The delicate reason is that the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimetres in every direction.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
The three men are “happy that they are alive” after the water flushed them off their fishing ship near Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue boats station declared an alert on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident at the bay of Molfre.
All three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued unspeakably.
"We saw their boat circle around and we thought of the worst," said Molfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind delivered him away from them before we left," he said.
Two men saved a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted, holding a fight.
They were all transferred aboard a coastal lifeboat and transported back to the rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men cast into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the ship had an emergency shut down, but somehow it was disconnected from the person that drove the boat when there was a coup.
Someone's got protection over those guys.
The judge refuses to deal with the case for Fatty's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who, according to the prosecution, were to get from Prime Minister Nečas and his then boss of the Jana Nagas political strike, i.e. a plausible post for political retreat.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
The brother-in-law, the Fuksa and the Fats allowed him with their resignations.
Then they showed up at powerful post offices in state companies.
Therefore, they also faced a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, wrongly, and they received a total of almost CZK 2 million in compensation.
The silencer is now performing as a witness in the bail following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building in the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Still, she wants to be a guardian judge of Helena the King (diversity of criminal matters - ret. red.) and to prevent possible objections.
This is how the case will probably get in charge of another Prague court of law.
The King has already removed Jana Nečas's guilt twice, previously Nagy.
It was alleged abuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
The silencer didn't fake in this case.
According to a lawyer named Jaroslav Ortman, this is a unnecessary response.
I don't think that impartiality cannot be interpreted as such so as to rule out a court of law if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be possible to judge anything for a journal.
"It seems to me it's a waste of time," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of the political guppet.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, a possible objection would have had a chance to succeed.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed on 13 June the prosecution of the former Head of State Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Naga (now Nečas), and other accused persons in bail for abuse of Military intelligence.
The picture's coming with Nečas with his husband to court.
The silencer was supposed to deal with Peroutk's statements.
For example, she was to judge President Miloš Zeman's statement on the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman stated that he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is dead!
The girl seems to have died in an allied air raid.
She flew to Syria with her two same old girlfriends last February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Ministry did not comment on her death.
Young London girls who escaped from their homes were secretly transported to Syria through the Turkish border, according to the police.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultanová, according to the media, headed for their other former classmate at Bethhnal Green Academy in London.
Last year's case caused a huge wave of attention, as well as tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims have yet traveled to Syria, some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Great paid work that you don't even need college to do.
This looks like the first look of the work of the AJ.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on the Czech conditions of extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180 000), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most wanted are personnel statistics by Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and applicators.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, they do not meet candidates for a job position, but a job position for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College isn't necessary.
Higher education is not an necessity for ayjacs.
Higher education means a good basis and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and in-supply of the candidate, but often does not have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not replace once studied college, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Carer CZ.
The most important thing is made in Prague.
The renters' wages are high above the republican average.
For the most money they will come to Prague and Brno, in regions it is no longer such a hitparade.
"The living conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," says Kubačka.
Technical directors will make the most of the money.
In Prague and Brno they can come to CZK 120 000 - CZK 180 000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall under CZK 80,000.
Questions are also IT project managers.
They can pay CZK 60,000 - CZK 100,000 when they start.
Fight is also about graduates.
While, in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, there's no payoff for it with their students.
If companies move over and overpaid an expert from another company, they like to squander after a graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
They can't do without the tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but at least a decent English is needed.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking especially for an educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a worker controls several foreign language, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he supplies the director of Kubačka.
Googlu, there's paradise.
Only silently can Czech workers work in Google.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, a possibility of working from home or a variety of reduced ties, not only for moms.
"The branded father gives the company four weeks of extra leave after the birth of the child," says Martin Jonek, spokesperson of Google.
Health care for employees and families, food, transport, training, wellness or massage is also involved in the workplace.
Who wants to study, has greens and doesn't care what a new student wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a free refrigerator is also certainly not an option.
Healthy lunch (in some locations and breakfast and dinner) is available every day.
In addition, all offices are so-called microchip, where people always find a healthy snack, they reveal a spokesperson.
And in order for nothing to be thrown out, he'll put in a box that employees can take home at night.
And the reasons for these at the Czech ratios for incredible advantages?
Create a creative and stimulating environment!
"For Google, it is not important that the staff sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," he adds.
The UN has strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that it systematically violates human rights by criminalising refugees.
The Bulgarian Government's official strategy " raises serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in his statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and powerful public figures express public support for criminal armed fighters, which are being held hunting refugees to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who pass to Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And what's even worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone under international law has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has held 14 000 migrants last year, for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - honage for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people in the past decade insist that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon is picking up people from the sofas and leading them to activity.
Time spent in front of the screens was originally shrunk on TV, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not excluded.
I'm talking, of course, about the fashion that Pokémon Go, the application based on characters that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990's (the later came a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomenons, there was a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The inclusion in other countries was then postponed due to the serious interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, smart-phone players go out looking for Pokémones that follow with GPS, and if they find them, they can “shot” them on the phone or “take them”.
Mania has seized a generation that has played a game at younger age, picked it up from the seats, and is looking out for Pokémones.
In the United States, due to this game, there was a significant increase in the number of steps a person will make every day.
The Cardiogram application for a smart watch from the Applu that monitors 35,000 users, recently for Washington Post, said that within two days of launching the game, the number of monitored people who had been practicing for 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information on who Pokémon Go plays - sees only rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to “ find 30” people, “becoming from the couch” and “be active every day” fell on an ungodly land, because most messages focused on public health are boring and determined by people who do not look well.
Nevertheless, the importance of the exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't show all over the place.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover so three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some even get new friends in pursuit of the ponies.
Of course, also those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At the time of the smart phone application, like Fitbit, they could watch our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news is taking a look around and the interest in her starts at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, more games will appear, which will combine the application and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help many people chase for activity, health and better.

Simone Biles got gold in a multi-bodied female gymnastics game
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic at the crossroads.
No effort on the hammer.
By the simple, they all were.
Excellent in everything.
And now the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics went straight on Thursday after the title in a multi-fight, and the others overtaken the entire line under Olympic reflectors.
The overall result was 62,198 clearly confirmed by her head in front of a silver medalist and a member of the team's “final five” by Aly Raisman and a Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafino.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the performance of the hammer in the multi-fight final of individuals in the sports gymnastics at summer Olympics 2016 in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a row that won the multi-stakes, and fifth overall, when she confirmed her best gymnastics' generation and possibly the best at all.
When her overall final evaluation on the board and her long journey until this moment ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success rank it into the same league of isolated athletes of their time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
She won 15 medals on the world championships - including the 10 golden ones. Her stunning formations are a mix of ambitions and accuracy and Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Retton called her “the best gymnast she ever saw.”
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not even between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her alone and the shore too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with the hands of a full-on gold medal, would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raismanová is hugged after the victory of gold and silver medals in the finals of female multi-guns on summer Olympics 2016 in the Brazilian Riu de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles received Tuesday when she was as a exclamationist at a party leaving National Team Coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in simple - the one that contains for her the typical triple salto with a double turn - is set into Latin music, which would just throw itself home, into the streets outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents like a bat and her talent discovered the mother of Coach Aime Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
The competition in the multiball race hasn't been lost since the summer of 2013 - it's a track of victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took short lead with two spins, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the simple - where Biles defend the world championship - they wait.
She got back to her forehead with 15,433 points for the hammer - and she ended up with 15,933 points in simple.
Raisman gently hugged her when they were waiting for the final score - only formality - and around the sparkly red, white and blue shadows, the Biles showed tears when they fulfilled the wishes she once wrote into the journal.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago when she was sharing a third line with Mustafin, but then a bronze for the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 20-year-old team captain, who Americans call "the bag," was a lot ahead of us.
After her simples, she sent a crowd of air kisses, driven by a return, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, she has a post that this 19-year-old boy put on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl at the age of 12 died during the most serious attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot when they sat in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot in a car parked on the driveway on 12 June.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handarm, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth the threefold murder of a robbery, because the attacker didn't take his wallet or the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had.
The Phoenix spokesperson, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators find out if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Latin quarters, there were nine attacks in four months in which seven people were killed, and two other people were injured.
"It's happening in the villa quarter before the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of the CBS station.
Police believe that the suspect used several cars, including brown nissana from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led to the conclusion that the attacks were interdependent and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transported to a hospital where she later passed her injury.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the scene.
The police witness said it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the target of which became an empty delivery half an hour before the threefold murder.
The investigators found the casings and the remaining bullets in the seat and built a bullet from below the engine hood.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcefalia: “His condition is improving.”
Edmund Piccito, like most of his age's children, loves singing, toys and, of course, her mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers microcephalies that are the consequence of the genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, didn't know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first time I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and maybe even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," explains Picciut.
Edmund's dating a walker.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit down or crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
But some of the mercenaries are already slowly filling in.
He comes with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows sign language that Edmund says "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciut said for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language-- he says that Edmund made up some signs himself.
Microcephalia may arise from a number of different states: genetic, such as Edmund, and after infection in pregnancy caused by viruses such as incinerators or Zika.
The symptoms and forecasts may differ substantially.
It's too soon to tell us what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives infected.
Picciut reminds us of a emotional tax that picks a uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What happens next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure about it.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to ever tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana made the governor declare an emergency state on Friday. On Saturday, more rains are expected in the state.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme drinking, many rivers on the southeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi are coming out of their shores and there is massive floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and assistance is already on the way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, Governor's spokesperson for national security and preparedness for the crisis said they were getting applications for a vehicle for water ride, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that just Tangipaho's precinct asked for ten thousand sacks of sand.
The flood patrols will stay in most of the southern Louisianas working Saturdays.
The meteorological service in the statement stated that it could rain around 8 to 13 centtimerts above the sea.
In southern Alabama there was a flood patrol in an emergency on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile City.
According to the predictions, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs on the weekend.
The Meteorologist Alexander Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in the nearby areas of Baton Rouge.
He added that the dangers are flooded by streams in the Ascension district, when these divorced flows will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further than the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest recorded level on Friday at 9 am.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the tidal waters of Amite and Wilkinson County in Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepfather were between the saved at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which are normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was warned by his next step-son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
We had it up to the waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever had on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge cargo cars in military style and moved them to the Gloster fire station, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that the floods are rapidly spreading with the continuation of strong rains and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinson announced that between midnight and Friday, 35 centimeters of rain precipitation dropped by morning.
Krautmann said that the land has been heavily strained from the center.
The authorities said that heavy rain and paid travel required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipah County and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The WWL branch of the CBS station announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the Tangipaho roof.
The inhabitants have been evacuated into two churches, both but now they are flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pet animals, which were watered by high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were set up for those evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to wash," he said.
In Tangipaho's district in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to floods and the locals got available sand bags that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last large floods we had here in March," said the governor of the town of Lacy Landrum.
These floods appear to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager for the crisis situation in Harrison County Mississippi, said that there was still persistent rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said there was a flooding on Thursday, but on Friday none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shooter Value Foods, Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "The guy shot as a trifle", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-year-old boys were shot in Philadelphia. This week is already a second shooting shot for a child at 6 years of age in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including slabin, legs, arms and abdomen, but when he was transported to the hospital he was conscious.
“He caught this terrible power, his little body was as lightened as the deal,” said his grandmother's station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgery.
The station family said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to be in first grade primary school.
Mayha Brown is among four people who have been shot in the Germantown area.
There were three other men shot: two at the age of 29 and one at 32.
One of the men of 29 years of age is critical, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are stable.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle together with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men might be a shooter.
The CBS Philadelphia investigators indicated that there was probably a shooting between several armed men.
There were casings of an attack weapon that belonged to a different attack weapon on the site.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
It appears, therefore, that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," said Anthony Ginaldi, for the station captain of the Philadelphia Police.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also reserved.
No one's been arrested, and the police are allegedly investigating video footage from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shooting on Tuesday outside the house in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I picture a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been at every summer's Olympics since 1984 and the US have never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
The gymnast number one in the past four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on their first and second run last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became a champion of the Olympic Games and America jasala.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in the female multiple.
And Aly Raisman's team member got silver.
We're witnessing a sporty top, but it doesn't look like it in country gymnastics class.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie attended the Olympic team the same journey as Aly and Madison.
They're a "final five" because a team of gymnasts for the next Olympic game will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is financially demanding sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, treatments, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trustees and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnastics have all the training and for the families of gymnastics and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aime Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at a time when they began gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring the training of gymnastics, which are more accessible and accessible communities of youthless girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I started the gymnasium 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer a gymnastics for free or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic origin) and we trained both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
Just inspiration from this team to us will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having shown you the "girl strength" and you won the Olympic team gold. And I thank you for encouraging so many young girls of all origins to go on the journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are prepared to join the next strike.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the settlement on changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election refused the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract with the fact that NHS was in “country nobody” and further delays would have a harmful effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Head of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, stated last night: “Mold Doctors are still very concerned about the proposed contracts, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis is going to rise and thus to fair treatment with all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors enter into a new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations met with the willingness to engage Dr and often with the deafening silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, that this possibility is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, press against coercion and resolve the fears of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, there were almost 13 000 routine operations and 100,000 visits, because sisters and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be closure of disagreements regarding changes.
BMA wants higher work payments on weekends for 55,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the President of the employers of NHS, called on young doctors to not enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “Only a few or nothing will be achieved, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and rise in fear, exhaustion and disruption for patients, the personnel and their families.”
In the past two months, we have been dealing with the Council of Young Doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employees hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as extrusion, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after the interruption of careers, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and pay difference between genders - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and Health Ministry take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Treatment for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs approximately 60 crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor's treatment reduces the risk of a seizure in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS vatchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS vatchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people will suffer from heart attacks or strokes each year.
Infection and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat that creates a consistent layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is severed, blood clots may occur, blocked blood access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot relaxes, it may continue with the bloodstream, blocked the blood supply into the brain and caused the stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of the formation of the clots being less likely.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who are affected by another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.”
Repetition fears may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient's life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.
We are pleased that we can extend the possibilities of treatment for many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from the Ticagrelor prior recommendation.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - over the three years are limited, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
Computer culture has begun developing fraud in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was called out of office last year for corruption, which was connected with the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to an overseeing of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, now being reported in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes police, electoral inspectors and city hall for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption action, said that intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should take courts in front of electoral rooms and guarded voters.
He recommended voters to take the ID card with them, and they could prove who they were during the elections.
At present, voters just enter their name and address.
In the report, it is also proposed to the people's fingers when handing over the voice to impose an incomprehensible ink in order to prevent someone voting twice.
Whistlers should have more protection, says Pickles.
He requests that the press be given greater access to documents from the meeting and to decisions adopted by the informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only protection against electoral fraud, but it is also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a consequence of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post following the accusation of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cics hit" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islamophy.
Rahman, according to his words, “he has conducted his campaign so that it is the religious responsibility of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned, or as the result of theft of identity, when a person voted and married to someone else.
Sir Eric stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern about fraud in the correspondence vote - which is claimed by older members of the Muslim community during it to put pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including proof of identity
His report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been put under pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"There were fears that... the state institutions welcomed before such behaviors because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean the system, including for political activists to be prohibited from handling correspondence voices and preventing the "voking of votes."
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also asks for more thorough control in registers to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider requesting voters to submit an ID before the vote.
Using an inseparable ink to the fingers of the person when voting to prevent someone voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Applications for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
To ban political agitators and activists from manipulating committed correspondence votes and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a cordon around the electoral rooms.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people who develop illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Disable taking photos in electoral rooms.
To require only English people (except Wales) to work in the electoral rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to elections individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court voted out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for Lithuanian corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For many reasons he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the power of evidence of a criminal offence.
He also criticizes the imperceptible “check of tick fields” in the voting registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “The Tower Hamlets wake-up call for a London court ruling.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Madness of the cycling double duchess Kate and other twins known at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Riu 2016 went mad this week to the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prejot, which is an obviously similar duke from Cambridge.
But the 40-year-old Olympics are not nearly the only child seeking gold this year, which can boast its own twin from a number of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that currently appear on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than far more similar to the Hollywood celebrity.
As a hunted game: A member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCapri since he was born.
In addition to Kate's bilateral cycle path, a number of people online quickly pointed out that some archer could be a double star Leonard DiCapria.
The racer from the team of American archers Brady Ellison caused a Twitter storm after his pictures were taken out, which are markedly similar to the Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he'd heard of his similarities with Leo since he was a kid.
"No similarity can be seen," said Brady for Huffington Post, apart from the beard.
"He's a loser and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking image between the British jumper Greg Rutherford and his favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafine with her big, marked eyes, was said to be a copy of Gloria Estefan's Cuban-American singer.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison's star for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan will “athaltic version” of the actor from the film Start (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of Rafael Nadal's tennis star and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efiimov is proud not only of the same snowing flame and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and of Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say he looks like the “Athletic Version of Joseph Gordon Levittt.”
Precious women: Hope Sol's nail (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter's actress (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
The football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of Laura Linney's actress, or the holder of the gold medal behind Gabby Douglas's gymnastics, proud of its wonderfully wide smile which seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for the fact that the Chinese swimmer said that "she blew up"
Diaries of the central live transmission from the Olympic Games at the CBC station have developed an analysis of the performance of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The beach ended at the fourth place of the Women's race at 4x200 m free-style shorts
The CBC Canada station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “wandered like a smurde” and “exploited.”
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when at the end of the women's crotch at 4x200 meters free style he began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had a CBC commentator team to bring "revival", said among other things: "The 14-year-old one from China gave up, you fool."
A lot of excitement, like a smell, blew up.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhanová (14) flooded the second steak race at 1:57.79 - i.e. 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rucková and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to get their hands on the internet quickly and were shocked by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Does the CBC voter declare that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “Exhibited?”?
That idiot didn't notice he was on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of a female steak race at 4x200 metres free style was described as: “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Kritika Byron MacDonald came on Twitter from all sides and many requested his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they did not stick back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon afterwards, Scott Russel, who was able to broadcast the CBC, apologized for a live comment by MacDonald and said: “We apologize for the comment that the swimmer has escaped to broadcast.”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to those who tweeted in response to the comment
Complicator Scott Russel must have apologized on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and posted their apology to reply to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald commentator comments
The station also apologized quickly and made a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, should not get into the ether.
We apologized quickly to our viewers on the air and to those who were watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon Byron MacDonald apologized on live transmission and tried to explain his note by saying that he did not want her to sound as a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the surprise of women," he said on the transmission from the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I was thinking of working a swimmer and not a swimmer like that."
"There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I am very sorry."
Customers in the Primark damaged by a woman who wasn't ashamed to try underwear in the middle of a store
When a woman sowed herself to try panties in the middle of Primark, they were not shopping for a certain direction to look at.
To make it worse, she tried to figure out how size she fell, she took her panties off and returned them back to her shelf.
In the browsing, she continued and at the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Flostastone she tried four pairs of panties.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said that a mysterious woman, after trying her underwear, “the brand wears and leaves the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, undressed her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, shaking like a monkey."
“Everybody just stared at how she took her panties off again, and apparently she didn’t like them because she returned them back to the shelf.”
She's done the same thing with three others before she finally decided she doesn't like anything, she's dressed again, and she's gone.
“She seemed to be fine with who looked - or that she would have thought of the person who might have bought the panties she was trying.”
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else had on him, and no one cleaned them up.
The event happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I evidently tried to withdraw them from the sale - what is also the only right thing to do.”
“I’d love to see if I could bring my new panties home and find that she was wearing them, undress them, and that they weren’t washed.”
Primark spokesperson said: “The ring knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkstone on Tuesday 9 August.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous out there, but because of this Dailymail.com video, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the very master of Krav Magy, based in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over a superior rapist, whether they approach you from the front or from the back.
If you get close from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free course of missiles."
You will then grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you throw it in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee to the weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you break the gun out of his hand, hit his head in the face and you start to step down, and you hold the gun on him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get his body out of the fireline, grab the gun and cut it out so the loser can't shoot.
At the same time, force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then break the weapon out of its clamping and start moving, keep pointing at it.
Sound complicated?
Look at the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of the ambush - if you are not a monster Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
The Traveller Ian Wright is offering the most dirty places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and the ancient reflexes - by simulating the most dirty and reluctant places in Europe.
Moderator and author of travels Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system licked its language with a euro banknote, railing on Piccadilly Circus, flush button on the toilet in the train and Russian public phone.
Before licking every subject, he used a luminometer to show himself and us everything we're into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide was filmed to Inner Strangth, has produced interesting results.
The idea to lick the flush button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repugnant, but it is actually much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke to his doctors and health specialists throughout his journey to Europe about strengthening the bacteria of intestinal flora and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the things he licked left in his mouth was worse than the smell.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, completely securely his immune system has tested - from public rails to flush stations
In the film he made about it, he says: “Since childhood, I haven’t taken too much care of my health, and in my mouth I had everything possible, from clay to eating worms and mud water.”
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wash, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
To compare, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but licked after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy product manufacturer Valio filmed the traveler's movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strangth, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
He said, “This is almost the most necessary thing I've ever felt in the bathroom.”
Nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to take anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Liner Strangth was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy product manufacturer Valio.
Mr Wright provided Valio Gefilus, a medicine that contains the bacteria of lactic acid and vitamin C and D, which help people strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system.
Nico Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio, for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the engagement, and at the same time it would enable us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in bowel health becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with more detailed information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked any of what I wanted from him - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie.”
The licking of some things was naturally easier for Ian, others quite difficult.
I'm glad we made some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of respondents combined the bacteria of lactic acid in particular with the health of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent of respondents reported that at least occasionally they use products containing the added bacteria of lactic acid.
The family of the socially necessary buildings in Saltash, Cornwall, destroyed the municipal building before being moved.
The family of the socially needed left a damage of £500,000 at its municipal home after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long number of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, civil servants of the housing team were shocked when they found out that the property was in a havarious state.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were ripped, garbage burned everywhere on the floor, and the walls were mutilated.
The family has already moved away and is deemed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing affairs at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether she would go and save the house.
She said: “For people here it was a nightmare, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is important to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is likely to fit into the consciousness as "not as much as a nice part" Cornwall.
The family is unusually familiar, and their names are familiar.
A couple have three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and the police said that the horrors of the family involved street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, fights and drugs.
Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned on the lease contract was awarded in June for antisocial conduct.
In several rooms in the house, which may be destroyed, smelling trash was found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, floor covering was ripped out
The neighbors say they saw 'em on the street, like a pen, and regular people here called the police.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner through house violence this week after they received an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbours, who were relieved, welcomed the eviction of their lives to hell.
One of them said: “They did not care for anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, you can't count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, manager of surveillance in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Wastes and old toys lay in a growing part of the community house
She adds: “It is shameful that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the conduct of her family. Retirement is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness must have scared her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who reported us bravely.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours, and at the same time it will send messages that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Corrupted mattresses, which after eviction remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Employees will now have to remove piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, she conducted a shelf in the house of the fire and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon received a fine when she was found guilty of being held by class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that money was intended for the basis of her son's house, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner, after moving out, are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
The police say they're going to be trying to evict tenants who break the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow from Denov and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave unpunishedly, and to those who would like to follow” she said.
The Deno and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners in protecting our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were scared after a low flight of military jets over the beach

Military Air Force declared it was a training flight and insisted that there was no danger of safety
The moment a low-air jet took off over a crowded beach, a frightened tourist panic.
There is a dramatic picture of how a military plane gets close to a touch from sundown people on a sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to pick up after they were disturbed by the engine noise of the jet aircraft without seeing what would come out of the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova close to Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationalists who made a video feed on social networks, said: “The plane went over twice as low and at one point it seemed to fall. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low appeared out of darkness
The Portuguese Military Air Force today declared that the pilot of the aircraft P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to bear down because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft was reported to have flown slightly lower than normal, due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the lesson insists that the safety of people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of the mainland Portugal this summer and demanded four victims on the lives of Madeira.
Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing ship in the course of the training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of the providers of burial services do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found out during the inspections in the second quarter.
In her view, burial services are most often not informed about their prices or issue written confirmations of acceptance of the order.
ČOI imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesperson, Jiří Fröhlich, informed him.
Inspectors have identified doubts at 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to the non-information about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the sold products were not properly labelled and once the seller used officially uncertified meters.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It covered urn wraps, candles coverings and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"With the fact that there is still a breach of the law in this specific field of services, the audit event will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London Schoolgirl, who joined IS, was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family found out about her death in Syrian Cancer a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Rakka, which is a bastion group in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family she died the moment she was preparing to escape from the war of a oppressed country and to return to Britain.
“A man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and warning for others, that these are the real dangers associated with the way to the war zone - is that he will discourage people from ever making decisions” said Akunjee.
Sultan and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London took on a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then on a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan family learned that in Syria she married an IS warrior - and married in a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he'll leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Leader of the Senate for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says he believes the candidate for the presidential elections for the democrat Hillary Clinton nominees Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his election.
The Republicans blocked Garland's appointment in the Senate, although President Barack Obama had already nominated him in March.
Leader of the Senate majority of Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid stated during the conference call on Thursday that he felt that Clinton would select Garland “with a degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokesperson later said that she and Clinton wouldn't directly talk about whether Garland would nominee or merely speculate.
He appreciated Garland, and he said that the Clinton team would not want to "screw the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of a federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "collaborators" and "survivor" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump's office.
He said Trump wasn't in the office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for both men and wives.
Magazine Trees cooperates closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of exposed known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find another generation of top models for his calendar 2017.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness differs from the old school’s playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I'm doing this for women.
He clearly believes that the calendar is too.
“We have to go back to displaying the timeless and classic nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and inspire themselves with photographs of the female body," Shaw stated in the calendar release press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl heading: who actually buys turntables?
Vinyl loves lonely middle-aged men.
Before deciding on a section of comments, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so much debated resurrection of turntable boards is associated not with the boom of the mills who want to love the originality of the physical object but with the nostalgic of the middle age.
Those who recently bought the vinyl album are most likely people between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely ones.
It is not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan - all this has an emotional dimension: the older people who buy turntables probably want to keep their feelings (55% vs 53 %) and are happy to be alone (69 % versus 66 %).
But youG's results are true?
If this blog was sent out as a television report, it would follow me as I head out to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and wide gesture. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go look at it."
So let's see it.
While the heart of Soho slowly spends its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, Confactions and office supplies - several fantastic specialized record stores remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I am watching from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an appointment in London this afternoon, looking at shops to fill out a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All those recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that it can afford it: it can now buy turntables that could not afford when they came out originally, and again buys what they sold in youth and did not even have a windar.
“It is from what I bought in the late 1960s and from the early 70s, and it is things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. At that time I was too young and could not get them," he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are likely introverts who like to have a company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fall into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new tide of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their turntables back," he says.
This could explain the boom of the turntable turntables of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of turntable board?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in the Phonica store that you'll find a pleasant community of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly disadvantaged with a system of uninterrupted payments.
Some lovers of turntable boards may feel engulfed in the digital world and choose to remember peaceful adulthood for a familiar environment of turntable boards.
"I think that filling the gap or the existence of material material things can bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think that's the case with a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers” is called co-worker from a pile of turntable boards.
The ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who had bought the vinyl album a month earlier did not hear it.
According to his survey, he has 41% of the phonophones that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables, the turntable doesn't have one.
At this point in the report, he was probably really concerned about going through a bunch of compilation bosses nove.
The aspect of “trovey” and reinvention of interest is something that Jonny (42) noticed, which works at the Sounds of the Universe (number: three men of middle age).
“Someone recently came and said, “I don’t have a turntable, but I want to buy on the Radiohead board so that we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of these isn't big, but it happens.
It's more about a product page than music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teens who get into this.
Fopp, where almost one whole floor is currently reserved for turntable boards, it has many more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are a couple of 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not so relaxed, as shops earlier - from speakers instead of a bountiful jazz calls the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you may find it hard to estimate when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is a few minutes in Fopp walking through and looking at various turntables in the straw.
She's one of those who's more of a searcher than spendin' money.
He doesn't make much money, so he doesn't consider that he's collecting turntables.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or whatever, but turntables have their magic...," it sighs in desire.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a business that apparently inspired the new generation of gramophone board lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look forward to being very interested in the dolls of girls in tight jeans and watching a group of teenage girls who are just loitering around the Polaroid camera, and then father and daughter decide to buy Crosley turntable.
On the left is a stairwell whose wall covers Adele's turntables, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of turntables.
No one looks at them - maybe because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's just a "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the sectors and send several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic region, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it spends the most luxurious goods of which the vinyl is definitely.
But while according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate - i.e., at least in recordboard stores, do not take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in record record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
I'm sure they don't spend the Thursday morning wandering around the record store on Berwick Street, going through the recordings and avoiding seeing a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator who's hiding behind the back of the unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrae - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest middle life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
Court in France refused to break trades in the refugee camp of Jungle
The Court of France rejected the commission of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of commission shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 demonstration shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, they offer cutting of hair, in provisional restaurants they sell teas for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Calais argued that the places need to be broken down because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they represent the risk of fire and health risks.
The humanitarian organisation in court stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups do not provide food supplement for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Spacious fashion shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court decided that there is no legal basis for preventing people from operating 72 commissions, but stated that the objections to the Calais Prefect were “inclusively understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much more important role than just eating food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places she threatened demolica was a coffee shop in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which runs a nonprofit organization, which offers 200 meals daily, English and French clocks and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being escorted in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition for the protection of children’s cafés.
Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the café would be “a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old.”
On Friday, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of refugees in camp after a steep rise in arrivals during the years increased to more than 9 000 - the most so far the most.
He thought he was dead.
Shut up, and the volleyball are out there.
"Since March, I was able to practice normally," he reported at the launch of the summer preparation in full force.
What have you been up to?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and then because of all this, heart issues.
Because when I was at Korea University, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
For two years, I had a clot in my doll, and I didn't know.
It hurt me. I couldn't find anything.
Then the clot came up.
There's a broken vein in the meadow, it's gonna hurt every time it pops or changes the weather.
But nothing that would limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
I didn't know I had an embolium last year at a summer tournament in Wooden, and I couldn't move.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I've been completely out of my mind for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How'd you deal with it?
I guess I had to live through it, and now it's just going up.
I know I've got some problems with the blood that I have to watch more while I'm going somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only last year when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the Wrecks, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'm gonna knock it, physically I'm better than I was before.
What do you expect from Ustow?
I look forward to this, the party looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners coming.
Let's just sit on the people's seat so that we can fit together.
Will you pick up the Ustows?
There was a reputation for an old-timer, but it's different every season.
Brno was eight years ago, now it's over.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was last in the extraction, so there's a big room to improve.
If we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first laps, who's gonna be a leper, we won't.
Is coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's had a lot of experience, and he's going to think better than last place.
But my arrival didn't belong to him, and I made an arrangement early.
There were other trainers in the game, with one I was a big friend, and it was agreed to work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been in a lot of tens of years, he's a good player.
He'll move us upstairs.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to be on the hook, and I like to get an opportunity on a non-leading team.
I've been in Příbrama for two years, but Staws is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team right now because it starts from underneath.
You mentioned a foreigner, he's already in Australian Boehm.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other at the university in a group.
And we had a couple of fun out there, and sometimes we got together after the fights, so we're friends already.
We defeated them 3:1, and I immediately at the start of the summer preparation in Pashtaw.
She's got a Slovak girlfriend, she's a nice guy.
There will be an American named Nadazdin and Brazil Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a good kid, Brazil who knows how he's going to learn English.
You contacted the American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so whoever's forming, I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what kind of players it is, and I found myself on the Internet playing, and I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some news on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd come to us.
How do you look forward to being a recorded number?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'll only be 40 years old, and I have no nature to switch to it.
I'd rather be at the center of the day, I'd rather run a team than have someone else run it.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore, if I was to be the other recording player and spend all my time doing it, and when something's not done, it sucks.
How many times have you been the number one?
Half in Příbrama, when it didn't go to Kust as captain, he hurt himself, then there was trouble with the money, and he left.
Since then, we've been up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, which I raised, I alternated one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers, and he chose the Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the show because of the embolism.
It's a new start now.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"To be once again at the stage winners and to hear the anthem is sweet as always," laughed Phelps, yet again with his eyes filled with tears.
His fiancee and his mother were on fire again, son of Boomer this time was calmly sleeping with the headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started to race, and in a few hours it's gonna be over, he said milk.
The final for Phelps nearly two seconds became the Silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long position.
Bronz won China Wang Shu, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carla Lewis, Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline on four games behind him.
After most of the race, the Phelps were headed by another American Ryan Lochte and the native Thiago Perreira.
While the defenders of the gold in the final krauřian 50, he set on to the harsh finale, they fell outside the medallion position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the opening of the hemisphere, he joined the finale of the race for 100 meters of butterfly.
The legend couldn't cover Ryan Murphy, who won the sign-up double track after the hundred won in Rio and twice the track.
In the finals he left 37th of the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkan in 37th, the third one ended up with Russia Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only five seats from last year's World Championship, Riu became a sign king.
Larkana sat down from the throne, to which the same double went to last year's World Championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Canadians, Penny Oleksieková and American Simone Manuel, share gold on the Krakow stand.
For the 16-year-old Oleksieková it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second silver from the brah.
Swimming gold won the OH as the first African American girl in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I go, said the touched Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the race for 100 meters in the world record in Rio and had a silver plate from the Krakow double.
Until the sixth time, the world recordman, Australia's Cate Campbell, ended.
Japenka Rie Kanet won the two-starry, for which it is the first Olympic medal in the seventies.
He has neither valuable metal nor from the world championship; its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia Julius Jefimov, who, due to the launch of the games despite the doping past, has been struggling with the disreputation of viewers and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was only able to reach the special panel of the NC sport arbitration just before the game began.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't, or if she has any other opinion, whether she turns into an arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointed, we could have won.
And the launch at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a strange day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going against.
They must have handled tactical preparation lightningly.
And then, at an unusual time, the game on the little courts started at number one.
The first hundred didn't start well, then they reached out to the opponent, but in the state of 19:19 they couldn't handle the ending.
The latter were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
First of all, a number of failed servicers meant a loss of 10:15 and a goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could beat the Russians," regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start of the game, we got into a great game.
At the end of my last balloon, I got a little bit of income that I used to get used to.
We lost the hundred, which was the key.
In the next set, we entered them with an overview on the field, another defense, and pushed them into service.
In tie-break, there's been a really bad presentation, there we took this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Too bad the beginning of the first set, that's where we got away.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second hundred was great, and the third one decided the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and there were five points, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playful.
How was your game in little yard number one?
Sluková: Like in China on the next yard.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, quiet, music wasn't playing, nothing.
That was different from the center.
We wouldn't choose such terms, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the game when you discovered the opponent's names an hour before the game?
Hermann, she was special.
We started practicing for the game without us knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do tactical training like the other teams.
But Simon (the coach of Nausch) set up tactics almost on all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactics ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember when you'd start the game at midnight?
Hermann, I guess not.
We played at 12 o'clock, but not 12 o'clock.
Ruska Birlov's block in the playoff for OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball Brandéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannova in hugs in the previous playoff round at OH in Rio.
Was that awkward?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since 10:00, we had the regime shifted earlier.
This was another two hours ago.
It's funny, I can't imagine another sport has sportsmen who have to give their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared as well as we can.
We knew it would be like that, but it's not very typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from our group was our goal, it's all right on one side.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I'll get some sleep out of it, and from tomorrow I'll remember the Olympic tournament just positive.
Big brother's here. First SIM walker coming.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to order a SIM from one of the local operators when they stay in Thailand.
I mean, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, who, for example, work in Thailand or make marriages there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Taorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sales plan of the SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the National Telecommunications Regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures to allow for monitoring their location are decided by the authorities to introduce them within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow the criminal activity of the foreigner to be dealt with.
In addition, the so-called SIM tourist are to help detect persons who exceed the permitted duration of the stay.
For vendors, this should appear only to the Thais within six months of the SIM side-by-side special SIM for foreigners.
Differentities will be the monitoring function that will be permanently switched on in cards intended for persons without Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function is not for Thailand at SIM because you can always be easy to follow," Tantasith added.
We must add that there are no anonymous prepaids in Thailand as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, a few years ago, one of the operators gave free starters SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They are currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, certain measures do not mean that a local operator enters the country of SIM for a foreigner.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own SIM home, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of that country after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM login to their network, only know relevant network information.
They therefore know a telephone number, but not information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local operators is so perceptible that even most tourists will begin to look for local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to keep an eye on the movements of foreigners from foreigners living in Thailand legally received immediate criticisms.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of the protection of privacy, the prepared system compares the obligation to provide residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if needed.
For any abuse of the system, it will threaten an unnoticed punishment.
"If the service provider follows the position of SIM without a warrant, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number will now be recycled until the expiry of the 90-day period after which the SIM concerned did not enter the network, the new number could be renewed after 15 days in the case of the departure of Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose a new apartment?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property care was provided by the manager.
The condition was enough parking places and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swinging, high energy performance and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old construction was not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the journal Modern Apartment.
The entire interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamila Polák from Artiga studio.
Why did you just address them?
Would you like to cooperate with everyone's expert?
Cooperation with the architect would recommend to everyone, if it was proposed flat from the start, that is, a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea about a range of possible materials and based on customer wishes they are able to fit the interior appropriately.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer at our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and residential space with the corresponding facilities for a four-member family understood as modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to establish the connection of the apartment with terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, quality of design had to be carbonised.
Did you leave everything in the union, or did you interfere in the final form of the interior?
All proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, have been approved, but the proposal has always come from architects.
In the beginning, we have set out what we expect from design, and we have shown some elements of interior that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mainly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Šplál or Otto Gutfreund, the architect helped to understand our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nutwood was the idea of an architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.
Were there any complications that you had to give up on the original ideas or, on the other hand, join a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was possible for the first time to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned were actually shadowing the surrounding building.
That's when we changed the disposition literally overnight from scratch.
A vein was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces are controlled by the skin, such as the plateau of the standard of Arper’s dining and bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to change or is there something you wish otherwise today?
I believe this is a modern air interior, which is primarily fulfilling its purpose.
We don't make any changes, most changes after moving were done in the plane of shade and residence of the terrace.
Perhaps the only rift is to the floor when nuts show up as being too delicate for a home with a dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornyová, author of realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of a new building, so it was possible to make complete new dispatch solutions within the building and several other modifications.
For the interior is an important element of the positioning of the sunways into the ceiling of the corridor and main toilets.
This gives us daytime light to the darker space of the apartment.
Also the direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says the Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where have you lived everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalistics, which made me get to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among humans.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are negatively tuned in general, but these days, things have gotten worse.
It's interesting that you mention negatism.
For some people have such an assessment of Czech nature.
Believe me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people may not find it that way when they come to France, because they don't see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a great topic.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
It's like I'm some evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for work anywhere else, and I've come across Air France's seat here in Prague.
I'll admit, I didn't know at first of Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years, and I can't imagine living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't get some negative reactions or doses, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress up any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone always looks at you uncomfortable, even if you have special clothes and stuff.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think that's the kind of thing I'm worried about.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a moment for a travel website.
Then we set up a website with one friend that people offer and look for shared housing.
We are only active in Prague so far, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs in the middle, and also two friends of Czech Republic.
I have to say that the next Czech specific is that at first they keep their distance.
They're not gonna let someone get to the body right now.
That's quite the difference between where I grew up.
In the south, they're all hugging and kissing on their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you didn't speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because hopefully everyone here speaks English.
Even in evenings or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by making at least a little communication in English, I don't have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Did you meet with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I'm thinking of one experience.
My leader, Češka, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense of: They're not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said not to go downtown, they'd call me there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like that in Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, at this point, anything can happen.
For the time being, I could not imagine something like this happened in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he's not God.
How do you feel when terrorists take over your faith?
It's really hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I'm trying to keep track of these reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří's square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated violence against them.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Are you meeting in Prague with other Muslims?
For example, my co-workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religiously established than I am, so sometimes we have some kind of wild talk about Islam because we all feel a little different about him.
I come from France, so I went through other education, they may have been taught by Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
The people of Islam sometimes associate themselves with their subordinate position as a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't think I'm subordinate in any way.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also means you don't wear any headgear.
Like hijab?
And he's signed off on the most important way I've been raised.
My mother, for example, is really a basic Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she doesn't wear scarf.
She always taught me faith was a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
When a person reads the Qur'an, he should make his own opinion of these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the sight of others, I thought, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the perfect town for me.
The Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated violence.
The yacht of Kozelská Fencl's wind in Riu was flooded on the progress line.
Friday's rides at sea in Brazil's Riu de Janiero went out by Czech yachtman Veronice Kozelské Fencls.
In Laser Radial's class, she moved in front of the final two detours to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
Packages are taken as humbles.
They want to compete with carriers.
TV director Matìj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are the idea of making the planned journey to transport the shipments.
With the idea of inhaling the life of a threesome of applications with a different geographical range.
We launched the Homers' app in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities in it, and we'll expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first, before focusing more on the abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz a four-year-old manager.
How does taking Takez work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data as much as you can transport and how much you want.
Someone might need a transport again on that day.
When it suits the route and the time of delivery, it paires up and both comes mutual notification.
At that moment, the cabin will open, where the couple will arrange for a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find your courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads need to be fully optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It's already working on the main tracks, and it's logically easier than it needs to be on the road between villages.
The more people, the more potential speed and accuracy.
People are also building their trust and making sure no one runs away with the package.
You didn't have to deal with this case yet?
How many users have a service after two months of starting?
Right now, we have about 5,000 people who create ways.
That's what we consider to be a success, and we believe that they'll pack another one.
Is there no danger that the Slayer will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the matter maybe the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay a few thousand for the big company's delivery within two hours.
You're gonna pay a hundred and fewer here, because that's the way someone's already taking.
Should traditional transporters be concerned about the potential future of customers?
We hope so.
The market has enormous potential, it feeds here huge multinational carriers, as well as business chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not match what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox that they're supposed to pick up the package on the side of the box, first that day after 7:00.
At the time, I needed a six-hour package and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matìj Liška (39).
Not one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the manager of the music club, Matìj Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which used to transport packages already planned routes between the world metropolis, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they submitted a project for the processing of the company, which created the application for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming took three quarters of the year and put the application on the market in March 2016.
The Przyvez applications began to develop last December and published this May.
This is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The application of Messík and Messík Profi have been developed since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which will connect one day to one.
In the Czech Republic they want to align the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service such as AirBnB or Uber.
You don't have any concerns about the action in the area where no one can say much about where the border of sharing is and where the gray economies are?
It's the same thing. It's another product.
We realize that if it's going to be successful and we go up there, we're going to be the next thorn in our eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it is not the intention to circumvent financial offices and tax controls.
Any user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes his income.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the transporter makes money, and will reduce the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people share, we would like this one to bring closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help and tell about it.
Maybe somebody's bringing you missing glasses, keys or pills.
People think it's been a while since I've been missing a personal approach, we've been saying about this app as a service to people.
How do you guarantee the courier won't run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with registrations, will scan the identity card and indicate a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and a man of credibility.
The couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of senders.
We also offer insurance, we also load details.
A non-insurable consignment in the event of a loss or damage is guaranteed by the courier, but does not assume liability under criminal law for content if there is anything against law within it and does not know it.
If the police stop him and find him in a locked package in his trunk, he's on his own, or ten kilos of hashish, he's outnumbered with criminal responsibility on the carrier.
Is there no danger of abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a supervisory administrative authority which will be the only one to have the opportunity to look into it, nor are we ourselves able to see them, data are against abuse protected.
How much money does he get after a successful delivery of a shipment into the hand of a courier?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The senders shall be charged several percent extra for making contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push on volume.
Also, the courier can't charge that he didn't deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, and he's checking the receipt with the QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We've got three sizes, a little bit like butter cubes, medium-sized egg plate, and a big bunch of beers.
After that, there are no more restrictions, and if anyone has room in the car, they'll take over the fridge.
Plus has the sender option in the package application to take a picture, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack the matter if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put the hens in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to that.
Then he showed me the demo of an application with a transnational range that is aimed mainly at the airliner.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to become an investor myself and put my savings in it.
Another year was the development of Shippansee LTD, before we started the whole product's creativity in London.
But this isn't a version that you're focusing on right now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to develop the application, because it has had all the birth pain and there is still something to deal with and improve them.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market we are not addressing so much at the moment.
We know it's a long track run, but we don't leave, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgraded in a way.
It was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address on the other side of the world.
It works for senders as well as Przyvez, but the difference is that you see packages in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocationr in your cell.
The application for couriers who want to live on it was called the Profi Messiah.
So someone can make a living by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will download a taxi driver in Prague, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn a trip to work.
Like all the stupid guys with the ponies right now, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
You see where contracts are around the city, it comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we still have a web interface that will be difficult for companies to send shipments to fill their data on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to use the service to phase out each month.
Are you now full-time?
It bothers us, but we normally do it at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
He's not hiding behind us a strong transnational investor, we're two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other came up with other suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for a strong enough investor to manage to jump off the Czech market with us, but who should, with the exception of the balls, go with us to a worldwide product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring treble of forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be more sharp according to the first information in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is intended to be based on the concept of the network spring in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement which, in addition to running, also includes the possibility of using the battle titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on the rotational movement.
They'll be reminiscing platforms and including puzzles.
Therefore, double jumps, running over walls and rope slides are essential to their overcome.
Furthermore, enemies will also need to be destroyed.
There will be no maps to remind the maze and levels with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to lift up the platform and close the massive doors.
So you'll be able to adjust the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore be between the raging events and calmer moments to explore the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper as a pawn with dreams about the pilot's career.
Cooper, at the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos, is about to collapse on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by hostile soldiers.
And there won't be any wildo in it.
In addition, Lastimosa will break death wounds in the crash, and Cooper will be given the task of setting up Captain's Titan.
His dream of being a pilot will be fulfilled before he expects.
But the first step is to steal the battery required for robot repair.
Cooper's calls to Titan will be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the military past, but the robot isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titan is dry, it will name all the injuries that cooper has suffered from a planned outburst.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign came from Polygon's server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impression from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ sign will live, however, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Norwegian company changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the crash, THQ published in 2013 gained a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic, for example, released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or a Red Faction Collection package.
Moreover, for the publisher, another 23 games are created, and 13 of them have not yet been exposed.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found 20 years of younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first, apparently, it took a long time to try it, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date me like that.
She's completely mad at him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had this girl's, in love with her voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching it all.
He went from work on a regular basis at a quarter of a year, and she always left at three to buy.
She tried every day to at least see him.
Later, I found out they're meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I had my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed at home after all.
I've never been able to go in there, take the decisive step.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe my wife has taken over my mind.
Soon, I think she found out that I was in control of doing what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a mess.
At that time, my neighbors indicated that they knew about it too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter suspected something.
So I always put it away, move on and on.
But one time, I went to his apartment to see him, and I needed some help in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting my wife and that he was testifying all this.
I asked him what he'd tell me.
He stood there, put his shoulders, looked to the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife once on my way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't say anything to me either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm such a person who's never really gone anywhere, who's having trouble meeting someone, let alone find a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about divorce.
I kept relying on one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her for everything, and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never done anything about it.
I've got it right now.
I used to tell her a lot of times, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the other house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
I always think I had no reason to complain.
And you can say she's nice too.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we're having a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she had me and she loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm tired of life like this.
Already when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that she didn't want to live with me and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is facing radical Islamists and the government and local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who distort public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop funding a mosque from abroad, where money often comes from preachers of the jaundice.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already intended to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, it was hit by internal disparity, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
At the head of the new Foundation, it is likely that the former Interior Minister and defense minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as advocates of the secular state.
In France, there are about 2500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, some 80 Islamic clergymen have left the French authorities of the country and consider this step in several more tens.
This week, the German police also hit jihadist spiritual police.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized themselves and later attacked the Sikh Temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on the new institution, which will replace the non-functional foundation, broke down in France.
Other terrorist attacks committed radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State have all contributed.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks to ensure the financing of mosques from home resources and also oversee them.
However, it is not yet clear where it gets finance, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee on the hall food, i.e. mainly the meat coming from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers of the hall food, for the granting of a permit.
Part of the money would then travel to the foundation budget.
The contribution of EUR 10 to 20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who are going to Mecca.
Every year, the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia leaves France for about 30 thousand.
In addition, in the French mosques, only preachers who went through educational programs at local universities should act.
This should ensure that their preaching is consistent with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have shut down 20 of them since December, and they will follow," said the Minister inside Bernard Cezeneuve.
"In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred and respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping center in North Spanish Zaragoza, writes Independent daily.
The shooting occurred after a woman with her daughter left the garage space in her car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he started shooting too.
According to witnesses, the man then turned his gun against himself, writes Independent.
A woman took an unharmed daughter to the hospital, for men in critical condition she had to bring an ambulance.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragonia, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motive was probably the recent divorce of both partners.
Bread wraps, we vacuum algae, ginger and chili sauce.
The summer wishes light, well-foodable meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer garden, it smells like grilled neck, bees, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, nothing too light, yet sometimes with the exception of salad or cooked vegetables.
True, barbecue is cost-effective for both time and dishes, plus it's a social matter and no one needs to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to do well with the delicacies that are specific to the table, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they're going to give us our health.
Whether it is a home sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-developed grifes are sufficient to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Just like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, it even reflects more time-consuming cooking and cooling off rice.
The paper can only be mixed into water for a moment and then only depends on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with accessories and accessories.
There's no algae.
Today, the advantage of a number of Asian cuisine dishes is that the raw materials are generally available.
Including sugar-cracked ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp yet delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, which says it mixes from several species of vinegar and a bell.
All you need to do is buy a bag suitable for size, and the Annex with proven antibacterial effects, which supports digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is done.
The banans.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating food in various celebrations and rituals.
The long grained leaves of bananas are very widespread in a number of countries of Asia or South America as well as "a aid" for the preparation of all kinds of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them in the same way as alobal.
The banan leaves the dish a specific flavor.
For us, they can be bought in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves of salt green, and thus healthy - not dusted and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad of vacam, sesame and sesame oil.
He can be bought frozen again.
Who often or prepares sushi will probably know the bursa nori in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori list – i.e. canvas intended for the manufacture of sushi.
Wakame – dark green algae growing in waters around the island of Hokkaidó – it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who wouldn't know the mix of cocoa soup, apparently Asian women use it for recovery after birth.
And at all, this algae has effects almost miraculous.
Cleans the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even allegedly prevents hair graying and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
The dried and debossed vakame also serves as spices, for example, to season rice.
Fresh algae shall first be disposed of in water, then flushed, inserted into boiling water and half a minute boiling.
Then they cool down in the icy water, cut off the middle ribs and continue to fit, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
All you have to do is wet your roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and throw away grilled bees.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of goodness, and you have interesting fresh food that perfectly combines flavors.
And it's done once and for all.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green radish, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g algae vakame and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
Corandro hair, a spoon of black sesame, a spoon of priracha chili sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g loaded throats of ginger, a little pin nuts.
First, let's get the coils ready.
The rice paper will be wet for five seconds in cold water.
Then we take him out and wait for him to soften up.
In the meantime, in the hot water, we'll cook the cartilage shoots briefly, about three minutes after which we'll quickly cool them into the ice water so that they don't lose color.
We will insert vegetable fillings on the paper and wrap.
We prepare the filling with white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped cilantro, thoroughly mix them with rice paper.
On the banana sheet we put some cartilage shoots, add threads, and finally finish the whole dish with a waffle, garnished with ginger, manga slices, put on a black sesame and add some pinnuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in the seven rugby, the choice of Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seven-point ragby ended with a devastating stop at the last obstacle, the Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro stadium here at Riu high 43:7.
The Fijies presented a master lesson in processing, dumplings, folds, support game, lajno running and brutal forces - and they gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an uncharted price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain on the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven rags proud, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The successful win over South Africa 7:5 in the semifinals of the same day, maybe they were frozen in the finals.
However, in its form, even a 15-member team would be defeated in full health.
You don't want it any comfort for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a medal around his neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijis is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has hurt a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is incomprehensible.
The Fiji began spectacularly, the British breakthroughs reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other teammates, it was like running around a series of buses in motion and World Cup champions leading 5:0 when Osea Kolinisa came out of the corner.
The magazine showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversation was made.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the balls.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from score three times, but only the Fijiians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa veremalua threw touchdown into the right corner, and the British were losing 17:0.
More than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the small British and ran into the rope where he scored.
There was a break after the conversation at 29-0.
It was like the Fiji for the ragby 7s were born, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
After a half-life, the British made mass changes and the support of the Fijiians stopped... for the whole length of four minutes, which, compared to the first half, was good until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji Josua Tuisov had gone on.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British to throw a touchdown into the left corner to increase an 36:7. But they had already won the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans on the willingness to sing, wave and dance.
It was hard not to surprise the completely joyful approach of the Fijiians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliam has weakened another attempt to win the Fijis.
There was a whistle, the Fijiians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely overpowered.
Before that, the same day of Fiji in the semifinals was defeated by Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom conquered the South African Republic in the tight semifinal - by a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got South Africans to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling leg job, broke the defensive line and scored in the second half of the hook.
Great late Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the 15th team of England, secured victory - and eventually also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the fight coach with cancer
You won't find any more emotional gold on these games, and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last one, during 220 punishing breaths to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further importance at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though two of them sat in a row, there were three voices in the boat, when the ship had squeezed on top of the second Olympic gold in the race of women's couples, they were with them in the ship still present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they were not completed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how water level flies with elegant weakness - do not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For each gold medal from rowing, the battalion of auxiliary hands, which little bit by piece mean different, and no hands were helped more than the hands of a coach who didn't know that he was alive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his word, it was uncertain.
I suffered cancer of the bladder, which can be performed, and I did this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your view of things.
Cancer was detected in December 2013.
The luck for the whole trio was that he could have taken treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, and cut it down to a minimum - if that's how we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together fast.
That was an impulse.
I went to the hospital and I walked in my room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Wandering alone is the way, but this was more difficult.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual, as he tried to handle his own restlessness.
Stanning, captain of the royal artillery regiment, who is behind her mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions on the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it highlights how much it means to me how much Helen and I have worked and Robin have worked too.
Until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he owns a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The two of them put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't deal with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crew from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused at a given moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't happy for the fireworks today, we just wanted to cheer up, go out and win the race, which we did good.
Doubles take a year to figure out what's gonna happen next.
Glover's getting married next week, her coming is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
Better be free to go, it says taximafie Rubesh hunter to break charges.
Six taxi drivers and a former master's officer in Prague are, as stated by ČT, accused.
You have made a number of reports, where you have revealed fraudulent practices and those who are to be in a group that will happen before the court.
You've been facing several unpleasant struggles with exposed actors.
How much is the report for you about the prosecution of members of an organized group?
I expected it to happen to some court.
I'm curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in prison.
That's useless.
Well, first of all, they should pay back all the stolen money.
And they should return them to drive free of charge.
That's a somewhat arbitrary solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any penalty as effective as possible?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another picks up the pizza, and one totally blew it off.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the exercise of freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Close someone in jail, especially in such a case, it's nonsense.
Such people should return the societies they took from her.
In the fourth century, they smelled that our country was destroying people's name and stealing it.
So let's make a good card right now and tie people up for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
Like someone's picking up garbage, they'd get a car and get people out of Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at the Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
These include people who started virtual videos in the Czech Republic and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for the Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a series of shows, now he is preparing the Prague Guide, which is mainly addressed to foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubes advises on how to avoid services in Prague and what it recommends to use without fear.
He used to film series with names How to, City scams?, Life in luxury, and enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
They are referred to as organized groups in the prosecution.
The police have been following her for months.
Is there a network of underwater taxi drivers worth mentioning as mafia?
They're so cute mobies, not the way we know Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia, juniors, but the organized are definitely.
The only thing about them is that they're guarding each other's brawls.
Prague is all apart.
I have seen that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Lázne (Disco club)
Everyone's just watching their place, and each of these groups is organized somehow.
It's probably a complicated network.
But the defendants are only seven people together, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate officer who warned the driver against the checks.
As you say, unwanted phenomena don't disappear from the streets.
So what percentage of the so-called taxi frauds you estimate is it?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
I'm talking, for example, about Aleš Ryjakek.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he's wearing a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday, he's standing at Karl's bridge and he's driving people.
Last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred for three kilometers.
His police haven't stopped him for a reason.
They've only chosen a few people from all over the big group.
The same situation is, however, also in other places of Prague.
Thus, seven people find it difficult to enforce famous Prague dirt, which seems to have much bigger dimensions.
It's no use, of course.
It helps, but all evil doesn't disappear, that's right.
They perform taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists all the time in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. Karl's Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations stands every day, and every day they break the decrees.
It ignores both city police and Prague magistrate.
He's not a cat anymore, he's a total indifference.
Byzenys of Prague taxilers in numbers
However, some of them, although it is only part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and will always be to make the center of Prague better.
And even though I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll continue to do it.
Needs pressure on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
There's no peace with that.
But it's not that, there are more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test rides, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although then claimed it was the amount of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had the receipt, the cops arrived, and this cab driver was so cute, he was still seeing those cops and asked them when someone was finally giving him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver overwhelmed the decimal line and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can you say that even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless amounts for short driving?
Their hardness is still incredible.
How did the cab driver reach 56 crowns?
The police sent him away because they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had issued the bill.
And that will be, I think, a problem in that court (a bunch of taxi drivers and one ex-expert).
On the one hand, there's gonna be some cab driver with his bills on the other side of the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the magistrate must not use secret tapes from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I shot the pieces about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for a story.
Do you have any doubt that this fact could protect them even in court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive six or ten crowns a mile, because he wouldn't be alive.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal line, which, especially in front of foreign clients, the underwater taxi drivers are moving.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about this fígl after your news releases have been published?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending out the show.
I just went with one cab driver, boasting in front of me, that he's the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the taxameter, glued with black cardboard.
When I asked him what it had, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If taxi drivers didn't work too much penance, can a court with their colleagues be warned to intervene?
Is there anything that can discourage them from fraud?
You've talked about how you think they're gonna find a way to cheat.
I don't think they can be betrayed.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair cabbies who should be fighting more for getting them out of there.
In my experience, I have to say, these fair cablers in Prague are fortunately predominant.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they miss the ums.
She can't walk much and can't tell exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (on account of a proposal for a full-scale restriction from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it did not seem very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't test against Uber that they just wanted to have the same terms as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
The idea was that they were just blocking Prague and it was just the best possible ad for Uber.
How in general do you evaluate the approach of Prague Master in addressing the problem of driving prevention?
It's obvious she had to go through with the criminal police to figure something out.
The Magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole who had information that meant that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope they charge this to the clerk in the final inspection of all the wasted checks to make him realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can think of.
I was even with him on one check-in, which I found out afterwards from their schedule.
A few months have passed since the publication of the last series.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mostly in foreign viewers, than the series is really the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let them have the videos.
And then when we go after the Old Town Square, there's a surprise that the same people who see on the pictures are really standing there.
Infamous famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd have put a piece around them to keep people looking at them.
Museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You drive a taxi when you need it?
Sure.
I ride with services I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many disciplines that are fair.
I only got a cab on the street once.
The driver told me when he got in the car, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'll be dressed as an Italian tourist.
It was written in 2005.
In the same year, Mr. Pavel Bem went on a check-out in the disguise for Italian tourists and immediately at the first attempt his driver was stunned by two hundred.
Editor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi driver charged him with his ride from the Old Town Square in 820 crowns, which is roughly CZK 195 per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague magistrate set the maximum price per CZK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed report: for example a two-meter road from the street of Paris to Truhlářová stood for tourists 400 crowns.
Dear rides also provided taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Bridge.
Even six hundred crowns are charged for driving on the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers away.
The frost is washed mostly with clear water as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
Its impurities go well, even if sometimes dirt has to go down with scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of bends.
It's not easy, and it's not going fast, it's got a job of a restaurant named Vanesa Trosto from Oldrich in Háj.
The cloud down in front of it: the tomb is surrounded by an elevation, after which you need to climb out and fall again.
"The restaurator should be careful, patient and unfaithful to the working environment," she concluded.
It's not exactly her first restaurant job in Frydlantsk.
It made it possible to restore stone elements of the facade in the back of the frejdlant town hall, also restored statues of St. Marí Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlanta, Pietu in the frýdlant street, Mariánské column in Frýdlant or atlanta in the front of the spa in New Town near Smrk.
With the renewal of Melchior's tomb, Kryštofa and Kateřina from Redern, it began in 2011 in Frýdlant.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleared from the application of impurities and crust, the loose stone part shall be secured against the fall and shift; either they shall be anchored to the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and maintenance of the surface.
They're already on the grave again gold.
"After that, it will begin by gulfing the inscriptions on marble plates with pure petal gold," said Věra Sobotová, U.S. City Memorial Care Officer at Frýdlant.
In the past, there are no records of the gravestone going through some repairs.
Closerly, the openings, carved in marble columns, will be occupied.
They're hundreds of years old and they're remains after the tomb was decorated.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the raid of the Swedes during the Thirty Years War, everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone. It meant Sobot.
In the church, finding the Holy Cross are restaurantmakers with a mild surplus as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order tombstones, which were under water, restored to the baptismal, wall painting in the tomb and now a tomb.
"We would also like to enter the village in the future," Sobot said.
The church is in a very good condition, we put the money in place every year for maintenance and repair.
Restauratory work on the refurbishment of the rednovine tomb will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid out of subsidies, the city will not deposit any money into this part of the renewal.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings of the regional round of the 2015 Historical City, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The mayor decided to release the prize to restore the tombstone.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over the period of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevails in markets.
Who would have said that by the beginning of the year.
The US S&P500 index, which has been going through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historical peak and has already registered 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
It is thus confirmed again that, in the long term, traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have always achieved theirs in the end.
In a situation where American shares on the historical max are so once again disappearing the volatility that has been the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfied and fearlessly due to the quantitative release of the American central bank and where the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below 12 percent.
And don't either.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week, the Bank of England has also added its hand to the work, which will buy EUR 70 billion in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative release therefore pushes such low yields even below and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million dollars question.
However, there are no risks at present, but the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilizing and it is not really a topic anymore, so we should probably not be surprised if the US shares continue to be in such a peaceful regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted to do this difficult work of an experienced policy, declared the Head of the European Commission Juncker, when French policy (really experienced, because it was so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) was called by the principal negotiator of the European Commission the conditions for leaving the United Kingdom of the EU.
Juncker's choice blew up the signs hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to look for Britannia's form of future friendly coexist.
But most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
She hates the great Britain.
As the Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014) he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he could only take it: the hard enemy of Anglosian concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulation was the co-author of the so-called banking union and is behind everything that comes from London's financial center City, established legislation on overburst regulation of the financial sector and services.
So Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, unobtrusive, and probably even unscrupulous negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed.
Therefore today the Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker from Václav Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Lord Kremlin has released his nearer Ivanov.
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanova from the post of president's office.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media of the appeal to Kremlin's press release.
Putin indicated that Ivanova was released on his own request.
When the meeting that Rossija 24 was taking over, the president said that it was coming to meet Ivan's wish when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for not more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The exchange report led by the President's administration, now led by Ivanov's current representative, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is named after one of Putin's closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer, for example, held the function of the Minister of Defence and the Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov said when he met Putin he was in the head of the state's administration, he was actually a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already fallen out of office 25 years after she had been put into office.
Neither Uncle's debities play with the Shafář finale.
So far, neither one of Friday's tennis matches has been able to turn into a final event.
Peter Kvitová lost her first fight to the Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after the sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová followed also the Czech deblis Šafárvá sýcová after a while.
Although, in the first set, the Sister Williams’ slayers were able to save after the win, the two bullets and the Russians eventually raised the set in the short game.
The second hundred then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Riu recorded Czech rowing: Ondřej Synek skifistor won his semifinals, when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated almost one second despite the release in the conclusion.
Today's good, the terms were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Son.
These are his opponents, unlike him, they had to fight for the procedure.
So it took them some strength, that might make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing in my cards, declared the Wisper of Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková but in Snyk's footsteps she didn't walk.
In today's semifinals, the five-year-old rower occupied the fourth position in her ride, and on Saturday she is expected to start in the B final and fight at 7-12th place.
London gold won't hold off like that.
I didn't go to the finals for the first time in the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I drove a quality race, and I put everything that was going on.
The matches were just better, the Topinková Knapková bowed in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get on her fourth games between elite six.
The battle gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced that anyone could get out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese to have such a finish.
And I thought I could get into the finals through Rakušanka.
Unfortunately, today was a live race, she told the world champion of 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, a young shooter, Filip Nepejchal, who was not able to break through his qualifications at the second time, was left lying this time.
In it Neejchal occupied 33rd place.
Qualification best came to the Russians.
From the first line came Sergei Kamenskij with 629 points, of the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neejhal's gunshot was equal to 620.5 points.
The program in Rio was first mentioned by athletes, among them also Czech seven soldiers Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučová.
Cachová is one of the second disciplines of the Olympic Competition 11th place, Czech recordman Eliška Klučínová is twenty-first.
Headed by Britka Katarina Johnson-Thopson, who jumped up to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiamová.
Both took care of the historically best high school performance in seven rounds.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russia, who's worse?
When we look away from absurdity as follows: The German society has gone through deep seberflexes, while the Russian does not.
In the 20th century, both major European nations were dictators, and there were regimes that were inhuman, brutal and horrific.
Russian Bolsheviks, from 1917 to 1989, contributed greatly to 94 million victims of communism, which reported by the Black Book of Communistism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetence of war or incompetent experiments.
Inhumanly, the Nazis destroyed about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, both Germans and the Soviets had made the revelations.
Not only a few individuals were guilty in Germany, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or only cowardly or by putting their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we are so guilty of the Czechs.
In Germany the denacification came immediately to an end of the war, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Dad, Grandpa, why did you participate in such superstitements?"
How could you?
This has brought true reflexes and healing of society.
The German elite has recently taken care of the country's prosperity, the removal of poverty, the welfare of its citizens.
Now others (usually idealistic) have goals, but they certainly do not want to join back as far as Alaska-Lotrin or someone - to revanš - military attack - everyone recognizes that.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the Millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the crime past is celebrated in Russia today.
The politiky of the Putinovského Russia is the revanš, the conquest of lost territory, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of own people are no value for the trustee.
They will fight, and they will fear strangers.
I still believe it's just those decades of the despot regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - predestined for Asia (seb) tyranny.
Who does the tension around Crimea benefit?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation in Ukraine-Romanian border in Crimea has been exacerbated.
Who does voltage growth benefit?
After a longer period of relative calm, there was again a deterioration of the relationship between Ukraine and Russia.
The province of the Ukrainian Party has become a peninsula of Crimea, which has been annexed more than 2 years to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both enemies will oppose, and it is difficult to verify independently, and so we only have the opportunity to think about the old question of who does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, terrorist attacks on Crimea have occurred from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, is rejecting Ukraine and, on the contrary, accusing Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces in Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savehenko known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped in Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, what would help Russia to make the situation worse around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
Russia can only harm the tension around Crimea, mainly by the West, in the form of further confirmation of sanctions and strengthening the anti-Running campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has come to a decline in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost a total credit in front of its inhabitants when President Porošenka's current support is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have been bankrupt long ago if there were no good financial injections from the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country, so as to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation against voters in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the forces forces' leadership want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia as well.
There is no hope that all those who attempt to understand an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally be aware of their huge responsibility for lives not only soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides and will stop their enemy actions in time.
Bulgaria first reported inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, in the last 12 months (serpen 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (serpen 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, so the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the routes of these categories of consumer goods: foods and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), other goods and services (0.3%).
The decrease in prices occurred in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5 %), health (0.1 %).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Service reportedly followed the Russian hacker attacks a year ago.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau for Investigation (FBI) announced that he was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, no official report is mentioned in the Russian share of the attack.
Moscow's share of the attack denied.
The report on the alleged Russian attack was strictly classified, because it would reveal that the US secret services of the hacker's attack are monitoring and could also reveal the way they do it and how they use their resources.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack event.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The material about watching Russian tracks was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, written by Reuters.
Only a small group of eight chief Members of Congress, known as a gang of eight, were informed of public officials.
It is created by the Chiefs of both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, President of the Democrats in both the chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the gates and security committees of Congress.
The Head of Democratic Party Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that it is creating an advisory board for cybersecurity, which is to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the hunted salmon from Albert.
The butcher apologized.
Based on the consumer's initiative on health problems after food consumption, Losos wildly smoked - pieces 100 g, consumer date 22.11.2016 conducted Prague hygiene control in Albert stores at Wenceslas Square and Na Bridge.
The audit found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer noted no longer available, and therefore the product was removed identical batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination was confirmed by the presence of Anisakis spp. Anissakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a man - larvae in body cavity or muscle fish are strong allergens and the human infected live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We are very sorry about the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrawn the mentioned lot from the sale, and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other lots of this item.
There was a doubt on the supplier's side, and at the same time we had this product tested, she told the new speakers Albert Barbor Vanko Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
Larvy will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vranyata.
They informed about the occurrence of a dangerous product of hygiene in Prague and Central Veterinary Administration.
According to a server of safe food.cz people may get sick with anisakiosis after a parasite, which has severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, or the disease can occur without evidence, said the CTK.
Syptoms will reach an hour of up to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adults of worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, therefore they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or in freezing.
The veterinarians have currently examined salmon and the consignee of imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples tested were parasites.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expeded, in most of it into the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packs.
Currently, a download of the unsold stock of the product from sales is taking place, said spokesperson of SVS Petr Pejchal on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately after the finding of the positive samples prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
The 17-year-old British wanted to flee the Rakka, apparently killed her by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and fast marriage with the jihadite that was killed by the weight, the sobering came.
The expected paradise for the Caliphate turned into hell for British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She calls her calls to Britain repeatedly and believes she wants to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders without thought to shoot, quote The Telegraph of the family lawyer of the late girl Tasnima Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, the girl called from there last time.
Then all she had to do was come up with a report on her death, which, however, cannot be verified.
The family communicated to her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped they'd meet again with the former student.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house in which she stayed was compared to the country's raid in May, said the British ITV News.
The TV added that the bomb probably blew up a Russian plane that attacked an IS bubble in Syria.
You would take blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, family lawyer.
At the week when (Kadiz) she was thinking about escape from the Islamic State, a single Rakušanka was caught in an attempt to escape, and according to the information available, it was publicly beaten to death.
I think she put it out as a warning and decided not to risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutton and her 15-year-old friends at Shamima Begum School went on their journey on February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and across Turkey to the territory of the IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadizu back.
You would take blue out of the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could to feed all the power to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking being caught, he added a lawyer.
The only positive thought of him is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or boys who can be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how they were there, understood how far it differed from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee continued.
The fate of the Kadizin's classmates is unknown.
However, as they have also silenced, their families have to accept that they are most likely dead.
Penitentiary for money.
In Scotland, you can go to prison without committing a crime.
Many centuries was the municipality of Inveraray in the regional centre and the seat of the Duke of Argylla.
Judges and basements under the hall have been served as a local prison since the mid - 18th century.
The conditions in which the criminals survived, they were pathetic, and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them are successful.
That's why city representatives decided to move the prison space to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time, and its closure took place for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the criminals and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public, the prisons opened about centuries later, visitors can compare an old building with a new one to see how different conditions prevail in them.
Guides in the daily costumes yet strengthen authentic experience.
To see it is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning signs on the body.
During the tour, tourists can get locked up in one of the cells, mostly due to photographs of memory, or to establish a feeling that prisoners live behind bars.
Besides, the Inverray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it seems to be haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activities have already gone out there and the museum is allowing people to come hunting for some spirit.
Such a night, however, will be 300 pounds, which is roughly 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, it also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
“Animé” effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animated, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app enables about 150 million users to change reality every day and to mess with the identity of ways that border absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or a figure that seems to come out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies each day.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
The Snapchat filters have in the past served criticism with accusations that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when this week, users offered a filter, which made their eyes wide, curved teeth and inflated faces, some critics described it as a racist Asian caricature, "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated questions did not point to the greater problem of society - the problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the following day that he canceled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a representation of the accounts to the animated characters, not as the cartoons of the Asians.
But observers who were witnessing racism, the filter reminded of painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused to compare with the animated.
Grace Spapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in the e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing clear Asian caricatures and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is touched into the pleural extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company that crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting halls in corporations around Holywood and devices that we all wear in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on the Snapchat - who are more racially differentiated than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive for a user,” said Katie Zhu, on Thursday, “only very difficult to do these things today without notice as it used to be.”
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and designer working for Medium decided on Thursday to delete his account on the Snapchat and invite others to do the same.
In the article for Medium and on the phone interview she said that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the predominant white, completely male company leadership and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnatchat.
“It’s either that they do not have any diversity and color among employees at the moment when they decide these matters,” Zhuová said, “or colored people work there, but not on positions to feel secure or pleasant to speak.”
Other observers share its opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of private companies.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to speak about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, the company recently adopted a recruiter who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and on internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users who can say it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Military officers drew intelligence on IS, says Parliamentary Committee
The parliamentary committee in the report issued on Thursday stated that the officers from the Central Command of the United States have changed the intelligence services report to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they have provided events from the country.
According to the preliminary report by the Group set up by the Republican President of the Armed Forces Committee, the Committee on Intelligence and the Defence Subcommittee, "excessive dissatisfaction" has been identified among central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors have changed their assessment of the US's efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The statements of intelligence services approved by Centcom superiors usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorist efforts than were confirmed by facts on the ground, and were more consistently positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the superior policy makers are submitted a misconception," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The failure at the head of Centcom goes all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of central staff in the description and analysis of US efforts in the training of Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is offered that the leaders of Obama’s administration ordered that the reports should be amended, it appears in the report that analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of the Centre to present a more optimistic view of the dangers of the Islamic State or the IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports of the Central Staff, declarations and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events were actually," says the report.
For example, the Centcom’s representative publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosula could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of the investigation," said Mr Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republic of Kansas.
From mid 2014 to mid-2015, they manipulated the highest position of US Central Staff intelligence service staff with staff reporting outputs in order to bagate the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have compiled a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that intelligence services relating to the Islamic State are being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, a more detailed examination must follow further investigations.
Further investigations conducted by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence are being carried out in the Centre's intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republicans.
"The 2014-2015 period and the 2015 Centcom created a very close process for drawing up an assessment of information on IS and the Iranian security files," said Mr. Schiff, President of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "was leading to the twisting of intelligence services," he damaged the morale among analysts and "it did not sufficiently take into account unconformed views."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to pressure the Centre’s analysts to adjust their conclusions according to the “preparations or political situation”.
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published on Tuesday at Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation of the Inspector-General of the Pentagon, which was initiated following complaints from the Centre's analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, spokesperson of the Pentagon, stated in his statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment because the investigation of the Inspector General still continues.
However, he stated that “experts sometimes do not agree to interpret complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether Americans are successful in bombing in Iraq and Syria (a statement now declared an increasing number of defense representatives).
However, last year's charges raised questions about how much President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff sincerely evaluates military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis places.
The criticism of the intelligence on the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than ten years, when the intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper showing that President George W. Bush's administration - despite many analysts' objections - was defending a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that, despite a public statement on the opposite, air strikes conducted against the Islamic State refinery, there was no significant financial resources of this terrorist group to weaken because the group built temporary refineries and oil sold on the black market.
The Times in September reported that the findings were not transferred outside the central headquarters.
Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was subjected to criticism last year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The United States won the ground hockey game in the fourth row, so today it will play the decisive game in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam in a match against Japan, which ended with a win at 6:1, scored three goals and only a day after the American team of ground hockey shot the first two goals of the match in which America defeated 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches are a success in a nice memory, but Bamová (27) said she's not sure if she ever managed something like this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write their goals.
But this is what he knows: Americans lead to 4-0 matches at Olympics, and they share the first place in a group with the Great Britain that remained Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have been qualified until the quarterfinal, and the match will decide who of the six teams ends at first and who in the second place will decide who will end up in the second place.
A team from the first place avoids the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans here started their surprise ride, four years after they ended up between 12 teams on games in London.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took hockey for the first time when she was 3 years (his older twins played Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
Olympiad escaped in 2008 because she didn't get on the final list.
Then came 2012, when she didn't even succeed, nor members of her team.
Another year, he was coached by Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the kind of pace we have today.
We've made a complete turnover.
On Thursday night Bamová began in the first half by shooting a bekendem goal near.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam made use of the opportunity.
She fled on the left side of the playing field, then she clicked into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The removal of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped each of the three wins to win one goal, was the first to win the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday match.
Zen trampolin in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is - is the Olympics.
The event in Rio de Janeiro makes it feel persistent, indescribable and prejudiced by the sequence of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot brah-cuffed pin that moves from the mirror to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee front without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the indignation between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley too.
Dooley, the coming lover of women with doggy faces, is at the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names are named in households in the main broadcasting time between advertising and sponsor spots, if he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine at all competitions anyway.
Far from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognised: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always have success in a classic swim style - and he'll probably be ruling for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favourite, let me draw attention to the inconceivable magic of the trampoline.
Even though the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first shown on the games in Sydney, they remain in this sport for 16 years almost without notice - many people who have asked me or knew that it was an Olympic sport.
This could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never received a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012 none of the athletes got to the finals.
Men’s prices are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the Golden Medals from London will be hugging Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The trampoline jumps have another bad luck, partly because the uninvited ear would seem more comfortable at a clown university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but I'm just an amateur watching from the ground.
It has a comic potential - comic vibration of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word “trampolina” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline”, which means “scanche”.
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and present formations with several elements (salta, verts and combinations) before they finally land again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "the reach in the air".
In Rio, twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
The warriors of the gold medal must move on, faster and even higher, sometimes until the end, another way and back, up and down.
They are trying to catch not only the target tape or the starting wall, but, as television reports, also another idea line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is nobles, admirable, a little fantastic - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But at the same time, I think it's rather exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Trampol jumping in this respect brings relief.
The track of the athletes on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected as if they were in a state without difficulty as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and, of course, it is not difficult, but for the duration of the assembly there is no furious struggle to achieve a goal, no distance measurement, but only a perfect, sweet delay of time and gravity.
This is just as close as the Olympics and the leaves come closer.
Qualification and finale of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern Time, then male competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC Station will be broadcasting within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a calm, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the fact that male athletes will be the subject of loving looks and materialization - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the gymnastics of the United States - then Logan Dooley just waits for its new fans to catch the breath.
"Protestant generation" in Ethiopia, U.S.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrates demanding political changes in Ethiopia hit government violence.
Witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during the police conflicts.
War in Ethiopia threatens?
Over the past decade, it was one of Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
However, over the last few months, anti-governmental riots have taken place, which have spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone into the streets asking for major political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police officers have been shot and killed by a bunch of unarmed protestors.
On round video recordings from protests, which probably come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of security forces are captured, how young people were beaten by clubs after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now asking for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second largest nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiopanas to remove the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of them in African countries, if any, get such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy evolved at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - even a new urban train takes place in the capital of Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be referred to as a model of democracy - organizations fighting for human rights without delay speak of government repression - opposition in the country has been repressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were told, imprisoned, killed, or thrown far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“When people suffocate and they have no choice but to protest, there will be breakage,” said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's testing all the youths.
He's testing generations.
Trouble is much, and it concerns everything from disputes about land to absolute control of the governing coalition.
After last year's elections, which have been widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies have received the last chair of the opposition and now control 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border is increasing with Eritrea. Conflict along this misrepresented, disputed border, requested hundreds of lives in June.
The analysts are concerned that separatist groups, which have been more or less depressed over recent years, such as the Orom liberation front or the Ogree National Exemption Front, may attempt to take advantage of confusion and rearme themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have burned down after years of life under the surface.
The first one is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Etiopans can communicate through social networks for the last few years when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and improved the provision of internet services.
And even though the government forbids access to Facebook or Twitter, as usual is happening during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Several young Greeks have spoken about how they gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, two of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long time of Amhar, mainly of the Christian highs of Ethiopia, they stood out in politics and trade and used Oroma, many of whom were Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that changes too.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said the Mulata Gemech, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in areas surrounded by Amhara and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is not rightly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and control the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is Melese Zenavi's death.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the President of the government throughout the 17 years until his death in 2012, when he had been subject to an unfamiliar disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly good at revealing the initial signals of dissatisfaction and using the ambassadors to process and gain the opponents' side.
"The current regime lacks fundamental knowledge," said Abdi, analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled from relative unknownness to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of Northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts claim he does not have confidence in security services controlled by Tigrey.
Many fear that there will be another bloodshed as a result.
Last Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government seized and then stole.
He followed a tough intervention, during which many protesters were killed - even though less than in recent months - and this period of riots passed relatively quickly.
Experts on development have valued Ethiopia leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian Government did not stop it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in Gondar City attacked the business companies owned by Tigrejs and the grudge against the Tigreys on social networks with ever more common.
Analysts say that protests are putting the US and other Western allies into an awkward situation.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an unsustainable area.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and the financing of IS as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to bagate the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that the Obama President and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the US public.
He also puts in an awkward situation his advocates, who resisted him in a turbulent time and must explain that he might not have been serious about his comments.
After this motion for a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted on the fact that he did not intend to say that the President and H. Clinton IS created.
However, in his Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump declared that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the statement made by the old just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump’s comment to alleviate Obama’s efforts to destroy IS, the Republican candidate for presidents did not react.
The most recent storm comes when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy while his preferences in electoral surveys are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan's duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this subject.
He warned Twitter that the Clintons' proposals were linked to the increase in taxes, and said that according to whom her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he removed the wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should access the Clinton e-mails, explain his comment later, saying: “I’m obviously sarcastic.”
This approach enables Trump to press the boundaries of political statements and to measure them as necessary.
“I think it is his way of testing, to what extent some of the messages have a response to his supporters, to find out how they react, and according to the reaction one or other way “by way” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
However, I also think that it is authoritative in its declarations, and they know that they are vague enough to explain them differently.
Since the results of electoral surveys continue to decline in its favor, Trump has chosen a even more eloquent tone in recent days, rather than to measure things to general voters.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump was with great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump even tries to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says but often blames his criticisms on misinterpreting his words or his sense of humor.
But together with the fact that Trump, in the final months, the presidential campaign is facing increased attention, Trump's jokes put his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former New York City Mayor, who is one of the most prominent Trump supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
"I believe that what she says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when he was asked about Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in that sense, that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization called a rookie completely wrong, and that was because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans try to argue that Obama’s government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed IS to beat and fail to cope aggressively in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to put fire on Twitter around him for the media for passing through his every word and being taken to him.
He laughed at “the pathetic, pathetic ” television scholars who tried to understand him and said: “It is not possible!”
Several Democrats escaped Trump's apology with the fact that it's just another proof that he's not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop was pushed out of the market price. Now it's back in Greenpoint
The Cafe Verb Cafe was a busy place in Williamsburg, where you could pay only in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that he replaced in summer 2014 - sells cake soaps.
Locals were crying out like the last loss of a growing town.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel was filled out, and with Verb is a soap shop now.”
But if New York is a change, then it's also rediscovering.
The expanded Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the original café, who is also the owner and executive manager of the new place.
In Verb, he began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay him to move to a new place, he said he'd make it happy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model espresso machine.
Even re-used the lights from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings like capers and fried onions.
You will also find brown rice bowls.
The coffee shop doesn't serve any more beer, but it offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the permanent influx of the original quartz.
“The number of original customers from Williamsburg had to move out of the prices,” he said.
There was one of those customers last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg, and in Verb Cafe went often.
Even then, the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when he closed the firm, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I love is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual ice coffee she gave her mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been going to Verbu since 2003.
He goes before work and orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eight every day, as an hour, I will come and prepare for me my swing with everything and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new ingredient.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets himself put on his own bacon, egg and ham.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soaps for Verb and use filter coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers transferred the offer to Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to build it soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juice wants to turn into a bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the coffee shop to spread to the neighboring building.
It's enough for a lot of customers to get their old favorites back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop opened again, I want you to come in and have a cup of coffee, it's like coming home.
"I liked the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Office and having lunch.
President Roosevelt, the drummer, enjoyed the selected meals of 5th Avenue, as was the pistes of the goose livers and the Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs for the evil way in paradise sauce, potato pyres and as dessert of plum pudding.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message to the Americans to eat.”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coe’s “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the story of a living house on Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which on Tuesday published Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the major economic crisis.
They showed their cooking solidarity, and they met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small sharp buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a wine sandwich, Andrew (57) had a turkey, a potato, and a mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanade, which, according to a couple, was great for talking about food during the crisis.
"The Caribbean was very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He sold peanut, liver and bean carnation.
They were made of the intercessor and other cheap foods, which the ingredients set up.
Stop the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe got away with it.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead," he said.
In years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was administered in the form of a buffet breakfast, which you eat.
Women's team was cooking for farmers and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was served freshly baked pie.
They were Americans who were sending food to starving Europeans during World War I. “And Square Meal” is watching how the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: The mysterious food, such as cranberry and castre food, was expanded as “a wonderful way to use the remains,” noted Ziegelman, because the chefs could hide the non-esthetic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after years of central point of American food - has become economically allocated by luxury.
Strange blends, which were to serve as a caloric and nutritional supplement, preferred them to taste or even to be sanitized during cooking.
During the research for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman has prepared her daily meal with baked onions filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the evening table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: “It was surrealistic.
The peanut butter with the baked onions isn't coming together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
Like never before and never afterwards, domestic economists, among them Louise Stanley, the federal government's government leader for the domestic economy between 1923 and 1943 - ran the dietary habits of the country.
They published prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget mines, and legions, like cream spaghetti with carrots, to transform into delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, the desserts were created in the reply of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose “I'll have pie”.
While he publicly praised the simple iow farmers' kitchen of his childhood, he served as the selected millionaire he became.
“The Council ate continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a almost greened room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't let him go by example with her own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the fact that the White House “were not only serving almost the best food in Washington, but also the most inexpensive way prepared.”
A number of dietary habits from the time of the crisis were said as soon as the country had reinstated itself.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way that science is applied to cooking.
A couple say they better understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's feeding habits during her book writing. Why she couldn't fire the food?
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman said: “The people were sick of her. ”
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It is called plum cream”, Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give elegant names to modest recipes.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, some sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each of them was reluctant to put a spoon in thick brown matter.
It was surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe has added, and then again.
And as a good householder, he said to his wife, "You know, there's a little bit of mashed hare."

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of patent against hepatitis C against the Merck concern
The district court judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to pay the fees for lawyers involved in the trial concerning the C-type patent against drug manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment under which Gilead was to pay 200 million for damages due to the violation of two Merck’s patents in connection with the very successful medication of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge repeatedly discovered anti-legal actions on the part of Merck, except under oath and other non-ethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman in the file on Thursday stated that Gilead was entitled to the exemption from the charges incurred in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, which dominates the market for new generations against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of a basic laboratory study for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead’s drugs.
Americans supported by military forces claim to have fully control over the city of Manbidz
The U.S. military troops gained full control of the northern city of Manbídz near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic state from the city fled, said the group spokesperson on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) now has been sweeping the city after leaving the rest of the radical group that had been hiding in the city.
The troops freed over 2,000 civilians that the radicals were holding, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the Alliance of SDF and the Manbídz Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we're still searching it," said the Reuters Agency.
In 2015, Clinton earned $10.75 million and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton published on Friday her tax return for 2015, indicating that the presidential candidate for democrats and her husband had income of $10.75 million in that year and taxed a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton contributed $ 1 million to charity, mostly to Clinton Foundation. The ex-president Bill Clinton contributed to the joint money by almost honoraries amounting to $3.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign minister awarded a income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster's publishing service for her work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton co-candidate, American Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, along with their wife Anne Holton, made public a tax return in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency”, said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the campaign.
By contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that he will publish his tax returns.
It is customary that the candidates for President of the United States will publish their tax returns even if the law does not impose this on them.
Trump, a New York trader, and his lawyers quoted a tax audit of the U.S. Minister of Finance as a reason for his refusal to publish a tax return.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's sidekicker on Twitter and made a donation to the democratic candidate's tax return.
Michael Cohen, Special Trump's advisor, told CNN Thursday that Trump wouldn't let the tax returns be published until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among which the Republican candidate for President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, it agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, commercial transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has made a strong statement on the issue, and on Friday she published a video which reminds us of the high position of the Republic of Trump’s publication in order to publish her tax returns.
On Thursday, the question will be mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates have done to the presidential office for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said before people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes for the last two years of the 1990s, and that the publicist New York Times quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim it could be the case at present.
Federal tax rates have become a subject in the election of the President.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the billionaire Warren Buffet to ensure that all who earn more than $1 million per year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week Buffy at the Clinton Assembly in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffy's Consulate of Berkshire Hathaway holds, invited Trumpa to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffy said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the financial office, but voters.
Clinton's campaign made tax returns public until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average, between 2007 and 2014, paid a federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, it makes just $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton's income was paid to dividends and interest rates of $10,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a nonortodox way to prevent elephants from going into human dwellings - throws condoms filled with chili powder.
This procedure has proved and Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea several years ago, together with the American organic organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and school volunteers in villages in north Tanzania, as by means of this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many used copies earlier in their defense.
Friday is the world day of elephants, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
“Since they have developed this set of tools, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more convinced that they can keep elephants outside their fields without hurting them” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in their statement.
The first and second step is to light a flashlight on the passing elephant and run the horn.
If he doesn't get rid of it, he's going to throw out the so-called chili flash.
Chilli powder mixed with salt and with petar packaged into a condom, the end of it shall be sown as to look at a wick out of it.
After detonation, the condom will explode and the fine chilli powder will dissolve into the air.
Most of the time, it's just one thread and an elephant's going in a different direction.
The last option is to launch a fireworks that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned in the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to the Arabs' “worship” - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin triggered a start in the media after it found that the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the word of the employee on the basis of the “request” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the documentary author of the “Shoah” holocaust, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German FAZ daily.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the state has not been listed among countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 the capital of Germany, the capital of Berlin, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel via its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation, and with the problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his word, "she was shocked."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was “decided after considering the management of the Kempinski Hotels”.
The reason for this step was further supported by the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that the call code of Israel be erased”, quoted Lanzmann as an employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as “a great disgrace.”
We were appalled and shocked.
It's a big shame about yourself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more disgraced.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the correct conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply “lose” in the requirements of Arab customers.
“Hanna you,” states another post, which points out that the hotel located in the nobles street of Kurfurstendam stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's diary, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by referring to the event as a “visit” and Lanzman “announced”.
“It has never been issued a direct order” not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber designed against protesting Brazilian students
A conflict between students and the police took place in San Paula Brazil on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber designs against the protestors.
The problem broke out when government order services tried to break up students, which ended up using rubber designs and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals proposed by the Governor of the San Paulo Gerald Alckmina to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see them spray on the wall writings against temporary President Michel Temer.
The most recent protest comes only a few days after the protestors went public in the streets to support President Dilma Roussef's established office when the Senate decided to sue the country.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan increased by 70 percent after the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the Ambassador stated, since international sanctions against Iran were abolished, there has been an increase in interest by Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia's export to Iran jumped at 91.5 percent and reached 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The decline in trade has ensured the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit the record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly travel.
In addition, Iran first reached among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome last year," he said.
At the same time, though, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I can strongly recommend a visit to Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilizations are well preserved," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after the British got gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in a male team sprint on the Velodrom in Rio when the VB Trio team defended the London title.
A three-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend pleased when he came to his goal and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth World Championship in a track cycler in March, even though Hoy ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized initial racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes therefore appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, the place that he tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton was also released.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was together with Hoy champion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record at the qualification, but the shirt took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his bike, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
Change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner to maintain the pace.
Hoy was following out of his position as commentator of the BBC, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped up to the stage, he wouldn't let them out.
A 13 - year - old Skinner, born in Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best of myself and do the honor of my name.
We created the Olympics record in the finals and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted to fall on the track on purpose after a weak start.
Later on, he withdrew and Britain’s opponents had no choice to appeal.
This time around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said: “With all these British flags on the stands, I felt like London.
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so once again winning the Olympics is just amazing.
It's one event, one golden medal for the nation who won seven out of ten contests in Beijing and London.
If this is to be a progress indicator for the past five months, then we have a successful five-day lead waiting for us.
With the form that Kenny demonstrated, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly on a day of 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
The same amount that Hoy won.
As next, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and takes the next three days.
A eight - year - old familyman from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's degree.”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were qualified as the fastest for the fighter race for four kilometres.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finale (22:42) is held today's second day of the race, to which the Wiggins will be at all.
Yesterday before the qualification event, he debated with the Commissioner when the referee invited him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women who continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trottová, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia made a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team was confident of his strong team of track cycling and controlled the mid-term of the Olympic Games and gained a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances, proving an absolute advantage in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have decreased during preparation.
The background was followed by dramatic events, not least the withdrawal of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April due to the accusation of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of a great career such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the verodium races shows, the legendary reputation seems to be able to give the team of Great Britain the ultimate performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
Uncertain future of tavír in Portland after termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium tavírna in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power supply plant that the undertaking supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the factory to terminate the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all electricity supply contracts will be reduced.
This step takes place after the Victoria State Government has previously decided in this year not to extend the provision of subsidies maintained by the undertaking.
The validity of a solid 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And since the factory consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other lavinous impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tavírn in 2014, which led to the closing of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is profitable and is threatened by closing it down.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley Valley Valley Valley, has stated that it expects one of the other three owners to terminate the contract as well.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Aluminium Joint Undertaking, a small business share held by CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
‘AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the factory will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were called ‘insurance contracts’ which were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a period of 12 months of notice, so that they actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, declared the plant.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited thanks to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million "in case of termination."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘no impact on its ... ability to operate a tavír or secure electricity supply to the factory’.
The American company stated that in 2010, Loy Yang had concluded a 20-year contract to start paying since November this year, although it still has to explain why she had resigned the contract.
Analysts are very careful as regards the possible closure of the Portland Tavíries in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, Head of Operations, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawattts.
If both companies had withdrawn from the market, this would have resulted in a significant reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.

Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the title page of the American magazine "Vogue".
Kendall, Ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who performed on fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry on this cover page," Kendall wrote.
The front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of humor in the introduction of Kardashian?) inspired video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (barky entertainers Rob and Caitly and together with them all the favorite uncles from the Subysss, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters they forgot to end the classic turning: they prepare a secret party.
It's a busy storyline for almost every "born" episode of a children's TV show: "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" With the sincereness of the cartoon on the show at eight o'clock in the morning, but Kris somehow needed to make sure that other girls on this audience could live.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
Senior Sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the shining edition of the magazine is another league.
The light edition of Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
A book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine is attracted by a number of advertisers (Fashionist estimated that from 832 pages in last edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The shooting of the star, which appears on the front page, is unexpected, so it is not surprising that in the last two years, images of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the headline page certainly appeared more “the celebrits that make models” than “models that are celebrityes.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's owner and Dior Ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later the honor of Laga Gaga.
But even if it's very unlikely that Kendall-- which magazine describes as the "north model" of her generation-- will fall into the first category, will be a very good society.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people or stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make well-cut video (even if Jenner represents all this).
They are clearly talented women who exist in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone is very excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult for her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original model Victoria's Secret in June criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, and called them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings were reheated with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the radiant Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you makeup up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own pywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who took pictures of the LOVE magazine.
And in the open moments it's in reality show, maybe only one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal assistance centres shall reject 160 000 people each year
More than 160 000 citizens at risk each year, legal assistance centres are denied, and in the sector themselves they are preparing for the impacts that will have further restrictions on funding for the already spent services.
At Queensend three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, threats to workers, victims of violence and people without money to fight unfair eviction and so on - are rejections already at a time when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal services that are already so attached to the crack are being prepared for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
According to the latest summary report by the National Community Centres, legal assistance was found to be rejected annually by 5,000 people.
Mr Farrell said that the situation will get worse without the federal government ruling.
“The Communist Law Centres in Queenland are chronically funded, meaning that thousands of people are rejected by vital services that they need” he said.
People who have escaped from violence, people with excessive and overwhelming debts, families passing through separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with the legal dimension, and this report shows that they do not have the chance to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which will lead to thousands of people at risk from Queenland having to focus on complex legal problems without help.
We call on a U.S. Attorney and Senator Queenland George Brandise to immediately prevent this short-term financing from getting people help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the Government of the State has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal assistance up to the amount of national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of community centres of legal assistance and the communities of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Prosecution for Donald Trump's campaign after the staff member allegedly pointed out a weapon
New York: Donald Trumpa's campaign was filed for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed out a weapon to a member of staff during a Jeep ride.
The incident was described in a court file which was handed over by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at Charlotte State Court, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he'd been waiting months to see the situation resolved internally before he could conclude that it was not going to happen.
Director Earl Phillip “marked a gun, put a right finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel to Vincent on the jaw”, said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The report states that Bordini, following a complaint with local and regional leadership, found that at least four other people experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The gun may not be fired to cause damage," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The appeal comes just two days after the Republican candidate for president caused arousal when voters in North Carolina said that they could step up owners and arms holders (which is regulated in the second addition of the Constitution in the United States), if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint his judges.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump didn't defend violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit asks for compensation for negligence and Phillip for threats to personal security, illegal use of violence and emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks answered the commentary report immediately.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, Charlotte's local intelligence branch, announced that Phillip left the campaign a few days ago.
Phone to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not react within a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump leads a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London but throughout the country.
For me Heathrow is a huge attraction, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from Olympic games.
Olympics have had enormous benefits for the Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs, and we will end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be those who will think that the Heathrow extension is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for Olympic games and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out that they weren't right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow will be able to answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure involving many people and companies, not only a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave an inheritance in the form of skills and jobs around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which, in the term and budget, set up an infrastructure investment programme for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal, which was chosen by the world's best terminal for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most busy runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway worth £16 billion of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic Games and spread Heathrow, to ensure trading in the future and to leave behind the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Director for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking ads
An attempt to bypass programs blocking advertising, has become a game for cats and mice for companies making online marketing. At least it is claimed by one of the companies that are programming such software.
On Thursday, so only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its web pages, which states that users can update the filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
Facebook reported on Tuesday that his desktop website will change coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
The spokesperson Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads and those who try to bypass them has lasted since blocking advertising was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-repair.
The fact that the company owns the largest social network in the world in the world until war only proves how big the problem with blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe made last year use filters for advertising around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now achieves 84 percent of the profit from Facebook advertising, every day Facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said, however, that society is going against advertising filters on the desktop, because mobile filters on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update the tool for “ad advertising” (ad preferences) to give people the opportunity to check how advertising is displayed.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new Adblock filters concern them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising on the site.
“It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem”, said the Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad References that control people.
Woman hit a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for events that on Thursday mornings several cars were run over on the highway by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
There was an accident on the A1 motorway near Morges in the Vaud Canton shortly after midnight in the counter.
The police in Vaud stated that the act of "a desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman of 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with a couple of cars, including a truck.
She died in the scene.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, they have still not all been identified. Police are calling drivers and all the other people who have witnessed accidents to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said Le Tribune de Geneve lawyer Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This must be what the plaintiff finds out," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases from the past five years, drivers will not be liable.
In both cases - of which one was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a walker who passed through the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was removed from the charge of murdering negligence after she hit on August 2014 at night and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne.
The court said that the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and passed out on the road.
The court found that a police officer, who responded to an emergency call, was in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was “a complete exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on the Thursday incident in Morges should contact the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
Tolerant town.
Prague is a popular destination of the LGBT community.
Asociace Czech travel agencies and agencies (AČCKA) expect Prague Pride to arrive up to 20,000 visitors within Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKKA Kateřina Petříčková communicated it.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began August 8th, the festival brings closer the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended the event last year.
"Praha belongs among the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," said Petříčková.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign visitors spend on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general it is true that LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in higher priced stays with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," said Petříčková.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival program.
Experts from the LGBT sector present tourism from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also be devoted to several thematic areas, which are the family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
On Saturday the festival will be a traditional tour of allegoric cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
A guide involving thousands of people in recent years will honor this minute's silence in memory of the victims of June's night attack in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrates forty years.
An indecent patch and Mat, whose attempt usually ends by disaster, has been enjoying small and large audiences forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series was premiered on August 12, 1976.
For the creation of this animated series, which viewers now know in more than a hundred countries of the world, cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Benes were drawn up for a magazine with two pieces of masters Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then called for cooperation between the dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimir Jiránek and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a round and a radio player got the characters in 1979 when Prague started in the Short Films series for Slovakia TV.
Names Pat and Mat then the Kutilians got in 1985, this time it was turning right for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where further works were created.
After his death in 1995, further works continued with other artists, many of whom participated in the share of the son of Benes Mark.
Currently, there are over 90 episodes with stories of theseuntils, which all fit under their hands, but never get angry and are always filled with optimisticism, ideas and fetite enthusiasm, and eventually are satisfied with their work, which shows a well-known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television images to books, to DVD and to theatres and characters or other toys displaying Pat and Mata are a hit of every toy shop.
A tale for Fiji and for the two-year Harmonia.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sport for you and one of our lives.
They both have a good end.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of all the earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend, and she's happy with her.
And what kind of things do people spend most on airports?
It's a Friday's overview of the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this sorority beat the team of Great Britain in the finals of the Olympian 7th ragby tournament.
It's the first medal that's ever been won by Fiji on the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted 60 years after sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A great deal of credit for success is borne by Coach Fiji.
But irony is that British Ben Ryan is.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest match in our history," said the coach before the final.
In the end, it was controlled by a sovereign government, with 900 thousand inhabitants now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The message was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without a hand for 11 months now and got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," rejoiced with a two-year-old girl, as her mother told for ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to remove her arms and legs, and then she sat together without protétise.
In less than a year of life, Harmonia was diagnosed with type B meningitis, with doctors giving her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a sense of view.
I saw her showing off to the other kids with the words Hello, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have my hands, she added her mother.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What are we spending most on the airport?
CNN brings the findings that people at the airports most spend on hot water.
He published data in the last year, including 10 products that customers buy most often in their shops at the airports.
The water was first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who's closing down the first ten?
You can't eat as one of the above things.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at the airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Land sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly reigned the category of two without a steering wheel for seven years and also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the few have gone to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and has been in competition since 2009.
In the Lagoon of Rodriguez de Freitas, 69th prize was signed in the round in the Thursday final.
What are we different than others?
We're just nicer, joked Murray already during the Olympic Regament when he was supposed to answer questions about New Zealand couples dominance.
Frankly, we don't do anything different than others.
We're just practicing hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-meter and a hundred-inch chasin, academicly prospecting Bond is five inches smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, for example, Murray has a charity boxing match.
And that's why she doesn't spend much time outside of rowing together.
Eric's getting into the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, he admitted Bond, who, too, demonstrated in a press conference, that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He has always responded first and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
But water destroys rivals with a calm force.
They are on their pace, and although they often do not lead in the middle of the track, there is no recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're walking on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to drive the first mile right away.
We're just trying to run a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we need to do to win, say 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the bigger crew at Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to stay on two without a steering wheel.
Apparently, at the London Olympics, the greatest defeat in their careers was made and the dominance confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were on the mentally well, said Murray.
We know everyone wants us out of the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once resident
According to the projection of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for the Study of the Universe have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate studies scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether, once upon Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water, and fuelled CO2, could have been subject to conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus turning can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, though, Venus was once proud of the rare atmosphere of a similar Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably dryer than on Earth, but once upon it there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and provide protection against rapid exposure.
Venus also used the Sun, which was 30 percent more louder.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow rotation, he sets his daily side up to the sun almost two months at a time," explained a scientist from the GISS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
Thus, the surface and the formation of rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds, which are treated as umbrellas, and the surface is flooded from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate change with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than on Earth today.
The model was built by Venus's story of similar evolution, previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans went off, and the water vapours were burnt with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and left only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the Geophysical Research Aircraft magazine.
Patrick Roy resigned to Coach Colorado Avalanche's post.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post as a coach and vice president of the hockey team's Colorado Avalanche team, as a reason he said he was impossible to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Powerful vice president/general manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and said that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"The last three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said Roy in his statement.
For a long and intensive period of years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me about his decision today” said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a profit of 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, involved Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and in the last two years, he has always had the matches after the season.
Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season reached score 39:39:4 and he missed five points to get second wild card in the Western conference.
Roy's cousin who signed up for the Hall of Glory won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil platform workers in the North Sea renew talks and interrupt strike
The top representatives of the negotiating parties claimed that strike on account of the wages for the oil platform workers in the North Sea are interrupted, while all parties of the dispute have come to a new round of negotiations.
The oil service stations for the Wood Group were occasionally reached at the North Sea areas operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wad Group and Union and RMT trade organisations may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for solving current disagreements’, the statement states.
At the beginning of the next week, we will have a number of full-day meetings during the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade union organizations, their recent actions, which were, according to their word, the first in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced the rates this year and paid its suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rate comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the company space to deal with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell deleted thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to leave operations in the field of oil and natural gas up to 10 countries due to the modernisation of his processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders to discuss one of the greatest work failures of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for all, not only for some," he stated.
To compare, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleids
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of speed-turning stars from the Plejada starship.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the starship spin at different speeds, as well as how turn times are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its history in its solar system," said Luis Rebullová, a research worker at the center of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Plyjada Star is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have arisen over 125 million years of age.
It's turning fast now.
In moments of maximum speed rotation, these teen stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect.
Along with how the star grows, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring time between the discovery of discernible points on stars -- similar to sunlight.
According to the latest data on turn speeds, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebule likes the stars to dancers, make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the “balet” Plate we see that slower rolling stars are more massive while those that spin quickly are usually very light stars,” Rebullo said.
Because Plyed's starship is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The meadows provide us with anchors for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebullo said.
There's still a lot we want to know how, when and why the stars slow their speed and say, "he'll hang his dancing shoes on a nail."
Rebullo and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rotation rate of Plejad in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I hadn't applied, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after studying without entering into specialization education?
It is to me that in the field where I would like to work, the job is now only in a more remote hospital, but in about half a year, there might be room for another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to solve the situation for about half a year, but the question continues.
Corresponds to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a Qualification Agreement with the employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institution which regulates the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure that costs incurred are recovered in terms of increasing or deepening the qualifications of the staff.
In the health sector, long-term pressure is being put on the table not to close these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions of acquisition and recognition of professional competence and specialised competence to carry out medical professions of physicians, dentists and pharmacists, it is explicitly true that participation in specialised education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not as an increase).
This means that the Qualification Agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Act if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation nor provides for an obligation to enter specialised education.
The law only lays down the terms of the application for inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to perform the profession of a doctor already due to the completion of the necessary higher education studies, even if under the law laid down by the law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised qualifications in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where the doctor’s specialization training may be included in other field of specialisation if its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Thus, theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the tacit situation.
However, given the fact that I do not know the more closely the circumstances of this case, it can be recommended to consult the competent department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Occupations) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and consultation services related to inclusion in and conduct of specialization education.
The Czech Medical Chamber, whose member each physician must be, also provides advice services free of charge.
Syrian Halab doctors demand intervention from the United States.
The United States has not made any effort to put an end to the siege (resurgent parts of the city by government forces) and have not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quoted the agency AFP from the letter addressed to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create an unmanned zone over the eastern Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces which support the army loyal to President Bashar Assad have announced that they will stop strike in the Halab area every day for three hours in order to ensure safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
