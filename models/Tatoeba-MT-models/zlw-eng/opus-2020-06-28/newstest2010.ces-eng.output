Barack Obama gets the fourth American president of Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for 1.4 million dollars will, among other things, be given an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperate between nations.
The White House Chief will arrive at the Norwegian Metro in the morning with Michelle's wife, and she'll be busy.
First, he will attend the Nobel Institute, where he will meet five members of the committee, who chose him from 172 people in October and 33 organizations for the first time.
The President's couple are then scheduled to meet Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonjou.
After this afternoon, the visit will culminate in the ceremony at which Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth American president, but only the third one to get the prize directly in office.
The White House has already discovered that Obama will talk about Afghan wars when accepting the award.
The President does not want to avoid this, because he realizes that the prize is taking over as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
War effort a few days ago has increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to stress any of his criticisms.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to put on charity, but you haven't decided about a particular charity.
A busy program will then lead the president with his husband to the banquet, where he will also be in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the start to the price, Obama was more held back.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated that it was not a prize for him, but for all who sought the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was a challenge to action.
The Protector of Nature Accused of Extortion
Litoměřický police charged President of the Civil Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice with blackmail.
In several cases in the past year he appealed to some of the building proceedings, for withdrawal of appeals he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Litomělic police spokesperson Alena Romová.
The chair of the Litoměřický Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnička.
He's in custody now, and he's under three years in prison.
Can not open message
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging from drinks, in the southern villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to replace you with a few minutes before you can find suitable dumpsters.
I don't want to say that there's nothing in Brno about the garbage.
But I find that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councilman is not interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only because as citizens, we can still throw paper, glass and plastic into the sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage cans.
Have you ever tried to throw PET bottles in the collection basket in the centre for example?
It's a good friend, but it takes time and hard nerves.
The only place I've hit so far is in the Moravian Square across from the Pozoned Huse.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't get mad at me, but I don't think it's much.
Not to mention, there is no honey in the other parts.
A lot of my friends are better off taking out the garbage.
In the summer.
They have it far away from the garbage.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounic Street in sight.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on my way to the spa.
However, the wastes flowed from it.
It's still the centre of Brno that may represent the city most, isn't it?
But the ecology and some aesthetics probably don't really care about Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy a hockey extract that will shame us all over the country, rather than buy a few containers extra and offer a classification of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm the official statistics after a while on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in all of the South Moravian Region.
"Paroubke's" budget took money for pensions and hospitals
After adding the Left despite the government's opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, hospital and construction savings.
But also interest in state debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists advocated some groups, they relied on sensitive expenditures, pensions, or the hospital government to borrow additional loans. "It is only the removal of problems to the future, putting mines," says Janota.
Because of the money we borrow, it's getting higher and higher, and sometimes it has to come back.
Too much choice to take, the state doesn't have to take it.
If the social benefits or the cost of running the State do not fall, the tax must be raised.
To everyone who has now added left: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
About pensions or sick people who have lost 1,8 billion accounts, they don't need to be afraid, they'll get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more in debt – the next year will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janata, debt will increase more and more quickly and with interest costs as well.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will not be enough to slightly increase the VAT or reduce the maternity as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to build motorways and railways due to money shifts in favour of several groups of voters next year.
These are mostly already complex and structured sections which are not suitable for the redesign and, where appropriate, to be reduced.
At best, law enforcement, which is also not free.
It means delaying or stopping 30 big buildings, also threatening to draw European money, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD suggested that the decline of money will solve Solomon’s – will go to the ČEZ dividends that the state of most of its own, and will put the transport fund in place.
The problem is, the size of the dividends is never certain, and it's not about a single source at all.
Last year, it came from ČEZ to budget for 18 billion.
Each year, dividends are subject to disposal of environmental damage, supplementing a pension account or serving as a reserve for pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases the real deficit of the budget to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, this does not stop the carnival.
Almost three billion have remained in the budget for various damages to victims of communism and criminal offences or for judicial expenses, even for building savings.
If the state goes around without that money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, notes Janet.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or in worst case touch the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already distributed two-milliard Treasury project, which will allow on-line monitoring of what individual authorities spend.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Treasury Minister hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans will count on the mobile phone in future, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile will be transferred to Android in seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware aims to target, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
They'll both be working at one and the same moment, suggesting Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first introduced a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware now cooperates with European and US smart phone virtualization operators and should reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains is suffering from hotels
The bells don't just worry about the Krkonose trainmen.
The missing snow discourages people even from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our site.
People are going through offers, finding prices, but they're still afraid to order.
And if they call us, they'll immediately ask if we think they'll be in the snow this Christmas or on the mud," said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want a New Year's stay in Spindler's Mill exactly as they imagined should no longer hesitate to order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of the accommodation is with him in second place, one may still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerov hotels so far offer mostly only weekly stays at New Year's.
I think they'll try to give them up for a while, but then they'll also allow and go for shorter periods.
And then the rooms will be quickly settled," said Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the University travel agency Ingtours.
Now, we're most interested in a Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
So half the seats in our offer remain free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonosech can still offer a vrchlabská travel agency, but the available places are less.
The first fourteen days in February are good for a stay, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that snow is still not snow.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than last year's room is being occupied by the Horizon Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few seats on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
Great interest is about Polish holidays in January and is well sold also February," told the director of the Best Bakery Hotel Karel Rada.
The Omnia hotel is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně, out of 80 percent.
On the contrary, half of the available beds remain in the newest spring hotel for Christmas.
We have a pleasant surprise this year, which we already have now is about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker so far, but once snow comes along, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will surely rise, said the director of the Hotel Omnia Erik Sprysch.
However, in the larger part of the snow, the Krkonoše hotels have to get their taste.
On Thursday, it's supposed to cool if there's any precipitation, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he should come back warmed up, told Jiří Jakubský from the castle department of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repacking is the mother of wisdom
He is as comic, with what kind of school effort Barack Obama, President of the Most Wise, repeats in the Afghan issue of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself considers to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he poured out his eagerly expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copycat from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself several times uses the dictionary "like in Iraq" but did not even hesitate to use the name of Bush's statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Path forward".
He himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq as "unresponsible and catastrophic decisions" three years ago.
The following months have shown, however, that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the Polish commanders was the only possible and most successful so that they are not talking about Iraq today in intelligence reports about Iraq.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor much more grateful of the default situation than it could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will come back again.
He was asked to raise the military capacitor again by the field commanders, especially the chief commander of Afghan operations, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating habits, criticized the weighty shooters at the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he made the general 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to extort the promises of another 5,000, although he himself originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. Obama’s entire doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will give the same fruit as the practice in Iraq.
Despite the murderous war of recent years, Iraqi society has been relatively well organised, its leaders of honour.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite sign - no one can be trusted and no agreements are respected.
The Afghan security forces used to change the master on a daily basis are badly prepared under these conditions.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a monumental village, for which patriarchal relationships will continue to be built.
Recognising the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex in view of the inaccuracies of ratios, which make even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even the construction of a "acceptable state", which is a minimalist target of the operation, doesn't seem too real.
Obama’s strategy’s time horizon reflects its electoralism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened, and now it's on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the warriors sent to war screams for the purpose of "a Red Return home" will cause a miracle made here, only the souls can truly romantic, unaffected by reality.
From a political point of view, the establishment of a date of withdrawal of the troops is an irresponsible one, for the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
NATO's final summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is moving towards a nebula.
European politicians do not and do not want to explain to their voters how German or Italian security is related to war in the foothills of Hindus.
Another factor able to radically intervene is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions in Iran will not affect, there will be a difficult question before the United States of America whether they will not try to solve the problem with military force.
It will be necessary to answer her at the time, according to Obama, America will approach the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, every such solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this turns out to be a complete blackout.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers won't get paid in cash
This year, U.S. bank leader Goldman Sachs will not receive a cash reward.
It was announced by the company, which thus reacted to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive instead of money shares that will be possible to sell first in five years.
Stocks can also be taken away from managers if they risk excessively.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is therefore attempting to combine rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go, said JPMorgan Douglas Elliott, former investment banker.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Banka Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she put almost $17 billion (over CZK 300 billion) aside for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of the remuneration paid in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the announced measure today.
The high rewards in the banking sector with the arrival of the financial crisis have become a huge political issue in many countries.
The UK reported in Wednesday that it plans bonuses for bankers over £25,000 (over CZK 712.000) to pay €50% on a one-off basis.
Similar steps are being prepared by France as well.
This year, women won Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
Today, the record five women in Stockholm took over the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf's Nobel Prizes in professional categories and literature.
A German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them four scientists.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their countryman Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The price for chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans from Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarification of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The final winner was Nobel Prize for Economics, acquired by American Elinor Ostromová and her countrymate Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that ran without the holder this year was physics.
Today, Charles Kao scientists took this award for optical fibre research and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded took over the diploma, Nobel Medal and a certificate of profit of a financial remuneration.
For each category, there are ten million Swedish crowns (over 25 million CZK).
If there are more recorded in each of them, the reward is shared among each other.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel Prize for peace already received this afternoon in the Norwegian Oslo of America's President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversialness of his appreciation, because he was only at the beginning of his path and, moreover, standing at the head of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in the defence of his policy, he added that the wars are in a certain situation necessary for fighting peace, although the price for that is high.
Minister Janota is considering the dementia. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Klaus will accept on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government, because he does not agree with the likeness of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps even Janot's maintenance in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meeting.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, he has too much deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the President's spokesperson Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, the House approved, on the centre, proposals for money transfer legislation and increased money to pay state employees, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has outlined proposals for social democracy that are secretly increasing budget deficits.
Among the left on one and the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, this was due to a sharp intropolitical dispute, which started to raise the question mark on the further effect of Fischer's administrative office on which the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
Criticians claim that the budget as the House has adopted it is essentially decommissioning the package of austerity measures which Fischer's government has imposed in autumn and which, according to it, is to suspend the debt of the state.
Klaus, which the State Budget Act can, but also not have to sign, today's debate breakfast with entrepreneurs, said that politicians have been neglecting "a serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, he thinks he no longer has a good solution.
The improvement could bring only a strong government, which, moreover, could lean on the wider consensus of political parties, is thought by the President.
President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is terrifying and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said to the ČTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the greens is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer said in response similar words to "speak words".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek in saying that the scary deficit is the budget that the former Topolánkov government has prepared for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called approval of the state budget for next year for success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in Clinton Eastwood's newspaper.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unfamiliar tells the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main roles are creating American actors.
The story tells about sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandela.
An inseparable fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and her first black President Nelson Mandel, in his life story, presents the American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was one-fifties-year-old Mandela asked if he could create it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role played by Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to access you.
Twenty-seventy-year-old actor who won the prize for playing in Eastwood's drama from the Million Doller Baby box, has already created, for example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in Božské Evan, but only rarely someone who lives and is as important to many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for the termination of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 for four years and then became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and it is the name of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with Captain of the South African ragby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President of Mandela knows that his nation remains only racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he decides to unite the ragby players who belong on a global scale among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually proceed to World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to get Mandel's story on screen.
I had no goal but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
Actor said if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing is that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that if I printed your hand, I took over your energy, carried it, and I felt like I knew how you felt, said.
It's important to me to try to be another person.
Matt Damon works in François Pienaara, captain of the national ragby team, in which they considered the white players.
Actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ragby.
A big surprise for him was when he first met with Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite clear differences in actors' characters, in comparison with their real prematures under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus was awarded Invictus: Unfused positive reviews and they were also talking about the ambitions of Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his reviews in the words: "Was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus gained 76 percent of positive reviews.
Secrets of glowing over Norway split out: The Russians tested the missile
Over Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Department only admitted yesterday that the intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was failed again, and the shooting called the type "Bulava", which was supposed to be the original boast of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black mouse of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during the rocket tests had no relevant effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava didn't usually fly or hurt herself in the air.
In the Russian newspaper, "Bulava" is already written as a "crate that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in order has already been the 13th attempt, at first, normally.
Until the flight ended, there was a technical damage to the apparatus again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third level of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started with a nuclear sub from Dmitry Donskij, who sailed under the white sea.
This type of rocket allows shooting from a vessel that is in motion and is submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by closer identification of the flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, Norwegians haven't doubted that it was a Russian rocket since the first time.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that there cannot be a clear speech of failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained, and the accident was hit by a third.
In the previous cases, engines were broken immediately in the first instance.
Although there was no mistake for one test start, the Ministry of Defense's leadership was only six out of thirteen.
With nearly 50 % success, the generals are therefore very optimistic, and they still claim that "Bulava" will fly one day without problems and that it will even take up ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be present again in the professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help their team of CSKA Moskva in need and will appear already on Friday's KHL duel against St Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career in the age of 40 in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we need another defenseman.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formal details, quote the agency AP coaching the Moscow club Sergeje Němčínov.
It's not clear if we back the famous hockey player will only have one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift up the spirit of other players, said German.
Fetisov therefore claims that AP will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in case of ice return.
In the NHL he played the entire season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe in the 21st century and signed 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarska, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold titles, seven titles of world champions, triumphed at Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he was gathering achievements in the NHL, where Detroit twice picked up over Stanley Cup in the dressing room.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the union, cancels all overtime
The management of the foot-and-mouth vehicle Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Just because of the often ordered overtime, the union announced an emergency strike on Monday.
It was confirmed by the spokesperson for Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the board wants to agree with the experts on a Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is essential, so it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December with two shifts being made, said Vaněk.
Server 7.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
They'll get people back on Saturday 28th November as well.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
They either have a late payment or they can choose a spare break on December 28th and thus take a day to extend their Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
Besides, all Saturday shift employees get paid fares and lunch.
Since overtime was the most surgenic and combustible point in terms of comments and complaints by experts, as well as protesters who stopped production last week, the management decided immediately yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Car employees were forced to work a two-hour overtime by the last week practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
After signing an agreement, the strike alert shall be called on.
Further negotiations between the car management and the trade union should take place on Friday morning.
The union chief, Petr Kuchař, said Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign the common document, they were prepared to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car came up last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay terms and supposed bullying.
The leadership claimed that overtime had to be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for vans.
In their Monday announcement, experts also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who interrupted the production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions after the company require that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they want to pay the reward of 5000 crowns.
Nošovice car Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production started last November.
By this September, about 80,000 cars produced, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects the 'used' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already been obtained against Immunity drugs.
The fact in some cases outweighs the fact that compounds do not cause the virus as strongly as some medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can greatly prolong the life of a combination of medicines that prevent the reproduction of HIV in their body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Moreover, the incomprehensible suppression of viral reproduction results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, which are no longer ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Heidelberg and from the University opens the way to deal with the residence of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metacarborans act on the protein responsible for the fertilisation of HIV.
Meta-carborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all medicines used today and can therefore overcome the resistance problem.
In their work scientists come with new “better” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to viral protein.
Meta-carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages formed by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case by a cobalt.
Tragic and resistant virus
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is necessary for the lifecycle of the virus.
Without HIV, the fission caused by HIV fission would not result in a mature infectious viral particle.
When we stop HIV prosthesis, we also stop the virus from spreading in the patient’s body, explain the press reports published by Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemicals scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in the experiment and also against its resistant (resistible) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborans on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but its effect does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which used medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications from metalcarboverans make interesting compounds for further research to design effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight for the budget.
Chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek named an approved budget for next year for "sudden" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The opinion of the ODS has been declared by the Prime Minister for strong statements.
He said he's keeping time for analysis.
Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to vote in the House on a minority that is involved in combating the growing deficit or whether he is going to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary Left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, warned Nečas.
The House adopted on Wednesday the 2010 budget, but with left-handed amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased money to pay state employees, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s impact on the address of social democracy’s proposals was that the deficits of the budget are secretly increasing.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus met the government's wishes that the revised budget was a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of a disappointment and a sense of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the government would still assess the situation.
The time is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened by leaving office in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered himself to the Prime Minister on Monday after government.
He indicated that he was considering further maintenance as a function.
The reason is his disappointment in the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for the next fight against the budget deficit, they do not, according to Nečas, have something to do with the government, the CzechSSD nominations, which has put the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give a demision if the House approves other laws of deficit increasing, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the Staff Act.
Topolánek: Ministers of Nominee ODS have not committed themselves
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers of the nominated ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the US text message.
He reminded that several Ministrys are in the Deputy Office people applying to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
In time, he stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the principle of fighting the escalation of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he leans on the leftmost which is currently in the House".
But then he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I did not think about it and when it was up to date, so I will attend to it, he told the journalists in the Chamber of Defence Minister Martin Barták, whom the citizens' Democrats had just nominated in the government.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer left for Brussels at the meeting of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister ODS, she resigned
At the same time, he stressed that on Wednesday in the House, ODS would clearly vote against the amended budget, unless the Prime Minister of the Democrats explicitly asked for the adoption of the budget.
We do not seem to be orphans, we are not young children, then he answered whether the ODS did not burden the President in Parliament and in the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevining of the House and destruction of all positive things, so Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new order of the Czech Republic, less trains will go for almost the same fare
Since December 13, the Czech Railway will cancel or limit some of the less-loaded speeds and elbows, on the contrary, other connections will strengthen.
The overall transport scope will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, more possibilities of connection to the capital will be gained by the residents of Ostrava, the tracks on this track add one set of pendolinos.
On the contrary, the speedboat stops going to Bratislava.
Less Rychlíků will also take place on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, there will be a reduction of direct links Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions are planning the largest reduction of transport in Kráhradecký kraji, a total of eight percent, on the contrary, it is possible to enjoy Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several speeds on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to just some days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today they have to take Milovický to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricity line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the destination station Praha Hlavní nádraží.
The ČD will run multiple SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jeseník will be on a two-hour journey.
Pendolinm to Bratislava from 13 December, passengers no longer drive.
This year's account for regional railways: about 200 million more
It orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, a total of four billion crowns will be paid to pay the so-called prodigal losses next year, as well as to this year. The locals are ordering the countries, they will pay a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion countries being paid by the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The elbows and propheses have a newly concluded 10-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The paths commend the system, and apparently they did not reach an increase in prices for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only take place on day-to-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška Internet tickets.
For travelers without customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLišky price will be new from the distance, so far it has been uniform between any regional cities and has done 160 crowns.
The Philippine gunmen are still holding over 50 people, children are free to go.
75 people were kidnapped in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
It was listed by the AFP agency, which initially informed only about 65 kidnapped people.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in Agusan del Sur Province.
Approximately 19 gunmen say he's using hostages as a live shield on the run from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is a armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police originally pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, the Maguindanao province was declared a state law because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the 23rd November massacre associated with elections to the governor's office.
For suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South African province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the powerful Ampatuan family was arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But they restored peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the American cinema is a new Hollywood film by Clinton Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the story of the former President of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-renowned warrior against apartheid was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he had chosen Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
Later male roles of the legendary South African champion in the Rugby Francoise Pienaara got fired by Matt Damon.
With the introduction to the cinema, critics and public are rising.
Nelson Mandela
The whole name of Nelson Roilhla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Mvez.
In 1988 Sacharov received the prize for freedom of thought, then in 1993, along with the de Klerek Nobel Prize of peace.
The President of the Republic of South Africa was in 1994-1999.
Great expectations, however, as they come to the public at a time when preparations for world championships in football are peaked in the South African Republic, but the media also shake up disturbing reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the Black Ruler majority.
According to the AP's intelligence agency, the votes for a new film in JAR are positive, despite numerous reservations against the main roles of the Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film, according to his words.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and prepared for it well.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela many times, as they say - to draw up his energy, said in an interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remind Mandel's personality and message with the film.
It is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every man, he added.
In the progress of the National Team Rugby
A picture based on the bookplay of British writer John Carlin with the freely translated name In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that allowed the nation to be created depicted by South African human rights advocate during his first presidential election period.
So Morgan Freeman, during the film, tries to dim two race groups and after many years, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in South Africa's national rugby dressing on the world Cup field, which JAR won at that time.
For entering a lawn in a dressing, which is understood in JAR almost as something sacred, Mandela has gathered a large ovation four years ago mostly in the White House and gained recognition of the Belarusian population.
The football championships perhaps once again can connect people into one nation, introduced the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in JAR gets better, it's just gonna show up.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as to the example of the recent LN interview, revealed to the fan of Rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The Championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
At Lounsk burning transformer for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the fire took over the transformer of the company Čeps in a divorce near the village of Štěkov on Lounsko.
Six units are involved in the fire, according to the spokesperson of the Regional Fire department, Lukáš Marvan.
Originally, firemen wanted to let the transformer burn, later, but reviewed the view, and fires mixed water, foam and special fire agents.
The cause was technical failure, internal shortening of the transformer.
No one has been injured, an accident according to the spokesperson of Paul Mandate does not threaten safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be several tens of millions of crowns, exactly after the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer will need to replace the new Mandate.
In ten years of operation of Ceps nothing like this has happened, the defects of this type are rare, has been fulfilled.
According to ČEZ spokesperson for Northern Bohemia Soni Holinger Hendry, supplies of electricity were not interrupted, the operation of households, offices, and companies did not affect fires of pipelines.
A.s. Cheps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 expansions with 67 transformers transforming electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system and the lines of the line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura will submit a criminal complaint to the Greek authorities of the ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will present a criminal announcement to speak on three socio-democratic commandees.
And that's on Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubické Region and the Captain of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jancura said it in the twenty minutes of the radio station.
The appeal is related to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in some regions.
All regions, however, eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about us choosing roses, and we only brought an offer to what they wanted.
He claims we are more expensive than the Czech Railway, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we're left with nothing to defend ourselves.
It's for an argument with Student Agency, said Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also stated that he had evidence from all the regions that they did not take action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Mr Jančura, who serves him as the unpaid advertising of his company and his own person, considers the issue to be another continuation of the media show.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my country and my country, and to the same challenge also to the others.
On this occasion, I suppose it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public on regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments in relation to regional rail transport, hashek said.
Jančura has announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the disadvantage of the regions.
The radio station said that after Christmas the campaign would be interrupted and continued after New Year's.
He made it clear that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started by Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railways with Czech Railways and on a contract of around CZK 150 billion did not write out the track.
According to Jančura, it is similar to that of the law and contrary to the view of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur said he had also threatened a Member of the Czech Republic.
The only threat was if we don't quit, we could lose our bus license.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I know which master he was talking about, and I won't say his name, said Radio-Journal Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
From January onwards, vaccination against pneumococococcals will break down used habits.
It is meant to be the first for free and optional families at the same time.
But the voices are already echoed that vaccination would be more effective.
Preparation for free pneumococcal vaccination.
The medical institute is already setting maximum rates for vaccines to be paid by the health insurance company.
Experts are also clear in vaccination practice.
New vaccination
Free Vacations for August Children
Since January, free of charge, children born last August 2 and later may be vaccinated against pneumococococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet received one dose of vaccination.
Those who began to vacate last year or earlier have to pay their own extra vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and the 5th month age of the child.
She had her children vaccinated against the pneumococcals last year with a quarter of families.
The parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required during vaccination with the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue CZK 300 to 450 000 per year for vaccination.
But it will save for a treatment that children need without vaccination.
So far, the state for all child vaccinations has given about 500 000 a year.
The vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot Package.
Pneumocok causes central ear inflammations, but also serious infections including inflammations of the brain blan and blood poisoning.
The pneumoccal infection in us will die in one year according to an investigation in hospitals of up to 28 children under the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic, we have introduced pneumococcal vaccinations in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, the views appear that this vaccination might be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it is to be paid to insurance companies and not to be liable.
That vaccination would be better, for example, indicated the head of the civil association Nadlas Rudolf Kalovský.
His associations of pneumococcal vaccines have long been promoted.
Experts at the international conference that was attended by our association were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we're glad we could get through this at least.
I think that's the path we need to make right now, said Kalovský.
But the health department doesn't want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumoccals.
At this point, we don't even think about it, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Srchenň.
Voluntary vaccination has disadvantages, says doctors
Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that he has voluntary vaccination of his disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, they might consider reducing the number of vaccinations "In situations where this vaccine costs so high, we understand a political decision that the vaccination was initiated as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect their infants to get more than 80 percent of their fresh parents from next year.
Vaccination against pneumocococcals is breakthrough even in the fact that it is paid by health insurance companies as the first inoculation of children, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money to prevent, save for other treatments, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy substances themselves
However, it is related to the concerns of practical paediatric physicians involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies substances to other vaccinations.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could put money out of health insurance.
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical physicians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of the American artist 's stealing from the museum'
The son of a renowned American fantasticist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempted robbery of paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
His name was Mr Frazetta, and the other man was used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains bagr region.
Mr Frazetta senior, age 81, was famous for creating the figure of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as stated by the Association Press press agency.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Mr Frazetta younger could be motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger oath statement, age 52, that he had done so on his father's instructions, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to transfer the images to the malting space", as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Senior denied granting any such permission as the agency said.
Labourists defend the planned increase in taxes
Minits defended the increase in taxes and cuts of expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget for counter-criticism by opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Torys "missed" the opportunity to show that they are seriously referring to the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the low-income and middle income disability.
According to his proposal, this mainly represents an increase of 0,5 % in social insurance and 1 % of the payment adjustment since 2011.
Resolution on social security
The union protested that low-income workers were punished for the recession they did not commit and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is about 3 trillion pounds per year - which has encouraged the business community, which stated that this is an employment tax, while a focus on recovery of the economy is expected.
This increase, limited to more than £20,000 per year, will be affected by approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODIES
Social insurance will be increased by another 0.5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75 % this year
New taxation 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase 1% of corporate taxes for depreciations for small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase pension measurement by 2.5 %
According to the government's estimate, some EUR 30000 will be reduced by £90 per year, and some revenue of £40000 will be reduced by £190, while some revenue will increase by £100000.
Ministers announced that their objective of reducing deficit by half of 2013 was "a complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the specific taxes should fall to 5% of the highest income.
The Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and restrictions on expenditure was 'the ocean cat' compared to what would have to be done.
"There are big numbers, this will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms stated that he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up the forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In this opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75 % - much worse than the 3.5 % decline, expected in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
The missed opportunity'
Consumers who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labourists, marked the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds over the next six years for insignificant.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as it might be worth, to add, 'cynics', to postpone this decision until after the elections, which must take place by June 2010.
"They added nothing significant that would be feasible," said Philip Hammond's shadow finance minister. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important notifications will be made after the elections if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that money obtained by increasing taxes and reducing spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce deficits, and argue that plans are "building to sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be inability to pay the benefits in next April - that this could lead to charges by the Chancellor in the election campaign if money would get difficult back a year later.
But the Labourists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very badly and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspected budget'
While ministers did not publish the expenditure details after 2011, the economists stated that it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The Institute of Budgetary Studies has said that Chancellor's ciphers indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially involving transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said Robert Chot.
"All important statements will come after the elections, if we win them," Roger Bootle added, economic advisor to the Deloitte Reviror's accounts.
"That was the report on the suspected preliminary budget.
The FBI's investigating US prisons in Pakistan.
The FBI is conducting investigations in Pakistan with five Americans, suspects from exposure to extremists.
The men were arrested for assaulting the house in Sargoda in the province of East Pandjab, as the BBC of America's embassy in Pakistan said.
The FBI said that this was an investigation of whether it was the same men who were declared missing in the last month in their apartment in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them say that they are from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they stayed there," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agents were informed about the detention and were in contact with the missing students' families.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their conception here and whether it really is missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington indicated that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It has shown that the house has always been the center of interest for the local police and that charges have not yet been made against the men arrested.
Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, told Reuters press office, but said that the United States had to "collaborate much more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the disposing of the infrastructure of terrorism covered in the recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Irish bullys.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years as the report of the Amnesty International expedition.
The report describes in detail how torture is "in the regime before and after disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and others said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and tens of them were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to the largest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were put on bond, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death penalty.
The writer of the BBC in Tehran John Leyne, now in London, stated that earlier in protests the Supreme Leader of Ayjatoh Alí Chomejni declared the injustice of some ways of torture and prohibited their execution in Karizak’s corrective facilities.
But since then, almost no legal criticisms have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
Incorrigible confession.
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology of Ibrahim Methhari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protests against election results.
"They often beat me to the face," he said in confession.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with justice, and humiliated me."
After five days he signed an untruthful confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated Presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who stated that he was kept in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
The Amnesty recognised that the Irish Parliament and Justice had set up committees for the investigation of professional riots and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were dead.
The group said that at least 90 people were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park was created ski slopes
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform the monument in Bristol in the convention track for the race.
The race track for the park was attracted by 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboards to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the convention track in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge 100 m long riding track.
The student of the fourth year of medicine, John Hickman, said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the convention track, but that it was really shrinking.
It was a wonderful sight of the lightning lights of the city down there.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the convention track.
After the Thursday night race, snow was left to melt.
They and we still are.
Could a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At the time when the Swiss voters called after the ban on the Minarets' construction and in general there is a message about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American Academy wrote and informed and thought about whether Muslims can integrate themselves - and whether they integrate themselves - into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
Some readers have become admirers of the author's last work after reading this book, "Why the French don't like the scarves on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on matters that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really went on at the base.
He spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes now caring for 5 / 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamian spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should Muslim enter the marriage union in the mosque or at the city hall (or both places)?
Should young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslimka marry a man who's not Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly global questionable questions which are discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than political drama that employ media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, not excluding Tarika Ramadan, Araba, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open discussion on how it can be simultaneously a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their ordinarys.
Consumers are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted an interview are attached to the house that it is an anti-Selafi's opponents Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how much French politicians are (and intellectual elite, who so defends the lay public) actually gave away the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims are likely to have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular Republicans.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "retracting values screws".
After reading this book, someone can have the tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most dangerous prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatic than the other planet's environment.
The bordering ice is pulling an alarming rate, which has an effect on animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers during their awakening.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, polar bear.
A well known for the complicated history and practice of whales describes a long tradition of polar explorers who tried to take hold of a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with the musket's collage is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who were swimming behind their bodies of just killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century there were suddenly 75 polar bears in one circus state.
Even today the zoo gardens have a typical area of millions of times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has a tuned green from algae growing within the Hollywood hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening species survival.
Although the hunt is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting from helicopters and Indians on skis and all are armed with powerful assault arms that shoot their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book "After Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, he offers a clear and unsatisfyed responsibility of science for the Arctic and a touchy summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists and oceanographers have adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research journey at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, first indicated the movement of the floating ice.
The submarines during the Cold War then plotted the moving transformations when they were set on fire.
Satellite survey and extensive field of probes in floating fridges are useful complements, but many are still being done thanks to the fearless individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the slab system within the Arctic Ice, created by leaking salt water, which is freezing.
But from the point of the bear to microscopic wonders to raise, all of this is doomed as soon as summer ice moves, which takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... we can be.
6000 members of the Marine Corps put the wreath on the graves in Arlington
Ensign De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a straight wreath on a soldier's grave, with whom he never met.
For him and other members of the Marine Corps who made a trip from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the National cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the graves, it was the day on which they gave tribute to men and women who once wore the same footwear.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about the fallen warriors.
If it happens to us, I want someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I try to do.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers who gathered the Saturday morning to put the wreaths in the Veterans cemetery in several departments at the fifth act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester burial company in Harrington, Maine, opened this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the fifth act in Arlington.
It is now 18 years old, when Mr nMoril and his wife Karen undertakes this journey every year and stops in various cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
Worcessters do not seek profit in this, a wreath across America, which they also lay in other states.
In this year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 garlands in Arlington cemetery, in the Pentagon, on graves at the Fayetteville National cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park, New York City, and in the monumental location of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart Foundation has spent more than $150000 on the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, stated that she had taken a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, the late armed force member.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to undo the victim.
It's a little way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's kind of like visiting a family grave.
Buried in the coats of a warm substance, volunteers went through cemetery around the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed towards the older graves from the first and second world wars and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves
The raid was positive when the children played and kept their hands together when they executed the young pine tree to the wet tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the top bee.
Near the department of 60, where most veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, they have remained truly silent.
The combined service organisations devoted 1000 psalms to decoration of the department, but the murmurful mood of the momentous wars filled this area.
Some were crying, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read out loud names, carved into stones, while others bowed to see small black and white names, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who used to wipe tears out of their eyes from his son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of the sergeant's attack artillery, David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single.. ..my son paid for it, right.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
American government contractor trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government arrested the U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by officials of the State Department on Saturday.
The supplier who has not yet been identified has worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detained one who was imprisoned on December 5.
Some accusations have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything known as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, are causing the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speech are considered to be serious crimes.
In Cuba, there is a young blogger community, led by a popular commentator by Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the price, but her permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American supplier can result in a growing tension between the Communist Castro's brother, ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was seen as a "remaining tactics" in improving relations with the island.
The first reported arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that if the Cuban Government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners, and creates more opposition space, the associated countries will take recipal action.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought commodities in a country where the average wage of state staff is $115 a month.
The Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are usually used to send text messages, because a 15-minute call would cost more than one day's wages.
Use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their international visitors and some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to apply must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is precious.
Most of the U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for triangular acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, U.S. Section press office for American interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she can't provide more information about prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities as would be legal in each other's open society - let's put free mobile phones - are in Cuba a crime, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group program, recently published an unfavorable report on freedom in Cuba, called the "New Castro, the Cuba tour," as an assault on the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and a replacement for poor older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are headed for greater dialogue.
Pakistan's civil servants disintegrate the conspiracy of men's transmission to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, Pakistan’s authorities discovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy concerning sending five men out of northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said that they hoped that this case could help cover up an extensive network of terrorists who are online looking for radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they were searching for grey rebel personalities, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered them when one of these men published a commentary, approving terrorist attacks has an Internet YouTube videopage.
Saifillah took charge of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into the distant area of Pakistan in the zone of indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer, who reported the case, stated on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in testifying to al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern part of Sarghody, far from the hordes in the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
The reason why they were set up was said by an official who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain approval for access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps, which is more important, to determine who is credible.
From the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Intelligence Service assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as watchmen who rule out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be confessors.
American fake recruits were subjected to a special investigation at al-Qaida, an analyst.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because given their potential approach to the American objectives and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, stated that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing the horse to join them, because the US intelligence agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of the ones that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Ten thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from negotiators in the Bell City Congress Center.
The protesters reported many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police say that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small loadings near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when there was a minor incident during talks about the climate that the United Nations sponsored, thousands of activists went through the city and carried out banners with English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says 'dost'."
Several celebritys, including Danish models and photographers Helena Christensen, took part in the protest, which stated that she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the unsatisfying state of the country in which the impact of climate change still occurs.
That's a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- walk through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do so, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protestors from approaching Bell's center and said that she had 19 people in the first place because they either had masks or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate corners, activists masked as athletes and black suits laid several loaded near Copenhagen’s main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, said, opened up the lights, but followed by "anything of the great explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to follow the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international meetings, he answered the English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is indeed something I do not realize).
Then he went to China and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on the prospects of everyone.
You can see the focus of the general public and various sectors and subject matter of climate change, said.
In other words, "It is also possible to say that this is a breach of negotiations or freedom of others.
The date of the test revealed constant persistent racial differences
Federal testimony from last week on knowledge gained from mathematics was the welcome element of good news about the public education of Columbia district.
Although the district is far behind high-performance systems of the country, the certificate has shown greater progress for fourth and eighth pupils over the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Test Centre for Progress in Teaching are persistent differences in knowledge achieved between African American and White Students, both on a local and national side.
The mean result of fourth class white pupils in Columbia over the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but in their African-American peers there was only three points, from 209 to 212.
The knowledge gap has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress in African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically meaningless one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon isn't exactly encouraging.
The difference between the fourth grade white and black pupils in 2003, when the first NAEP was made in the district, amounted to 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly near 58.
In the last week, some advocates of education in the district noted that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee's mystery, and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were significantly stimulated in white students where the results had been high.
This would indicate that we have increased the sum of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, non-profit groups that defend the equality of education in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of the distraction of two or three points, she told the member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticising Mrs. Rhee's administration style, Mrs. Brown said that the test results report meant high schooling in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the hammers, and I respect it.
But what is horrifying is that we haven't spent almost any time and energy that we needed to pay to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that trying the district is continuing to find better ways to focus on the needs of students with low results.
By doing this, for example, some teachers are trained in using new curriculum read, Wilson's system of reading, focused on students of higher primary schools and secondary school students who have failed to handle the basics of reading earlier in their school careers significantly fall behind their peers.
Every day mathematics and curriculum of mathematics to the sixth grade, emphasising games and experiences of real life, which came into the precinct for former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the fair of progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And right now, I think we should continue to work and do the best we can for those students who stay below class, said Mrs. Rhee.
The others stated that the results of NAEP had clarified whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and money for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain won dilemma of Mrs Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studies the test results in urban areas.
The conventional repair procedure is to target the means and administrative reform of the school, located at the worst parts of the district of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring about political challenges that aim at an important agenda.
But the extract also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the midrange between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to use our schools' relatives so that all families, regardless of where they live, can expect their children to be given an excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the Director of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to exercise the right of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to discuss changes, said Mr Janey, who has concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers to be a "inferior" to look for a greater increase in the next year.
Make Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered Gettysburg college with loud respiration.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out, and for a moment rested on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Gracielin's parents hardly attended a college school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never stepped on the ground track.
Now she and other eighth-class students in the group explored Gettysburg, where the school was $38690 a year, their position was rather than a determination by visitors by the enthusiasm of potential students.
That's it! she called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, she was thinking about it when they showed them a low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania railway was one of the seven that visited their three-day tour and were now completely interested in the future report: The question is not whether you enter the dorm.
The question is from where.
However, this is a serious problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who get secondary education and so enter middle class.
In fact, five in this "big generation" of Spanish students from the dormitory - remarkable results show that many of their immigrants' parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americas, have come to the United States without finishing their college.
Their story of success is important, say researchers, because it undermines their point of path forward for generation, which played a marginal role in the field of labour forces of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural affection for school and ingenuity and efforts to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an outstanding role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate from college - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we look at the fact that children leave groups with low incomes whose parents have no experience and ability to help them orient themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point does not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, researchers at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about providing these children with a log net at preschool age in all ways to get rid of college.
The Federal Program, which financed the Graciely tour after the tracks, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (accept yourself), it provides over 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to launch the next preparatory programmes, which start for students from groups with small incomes in secondary schools and continue until these students end up in college.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom entered the railways, according to the data of the US Ministry of Education.
The oil ministry of Iraq has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to bring an important oil company to rebuild its poor infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Irish oil industry department with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in the recovery of Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of wars and sanctions.
The US companies have left with capital participation just to two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was auctioned in June.
The comparison of the participation of American oil giants in the open and Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the road to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That'll be a long time before anything else is sold in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings in Tuesday and political instability, as well as US military downloads, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which clearly has the third largest raw reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were at a disadvantage, especially China and other governments controlled by energy companies, have significantly lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only companies in America to conclude agreements with the Ministry.
First American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhills, who kept close contacts with the Iraqi oil industry ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts allocated at the end of this week.
The National Petroleum Corp of China participated in tenders for more than all other companies and left with great shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economicist, as well as technological force, said the spokesperson of the Assam Jihad oil industry.
We believe that China's company will be comparable to competition and will stand up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were initially selected for the submission of tenders which were then compared by the Ministry at the barel price and the Ministry is willing to pay for the increase of output above the current level in each field.
The al-Qaeda spy planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
On the impact of the American missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, the top al-Qaida surgery planner was apparently killed, as reported by American anti-terrorist officers on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the supreme leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed on their carriage near Miran Sevverní Vaziristan in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have known that missiles have been fired from an aeroplane without a crew of a type operated by the CIA in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were led to a white car headed towards the Afghan border when they were hit, said the official along with the Pakistani civical intelligence agency, who telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that local gunmen came to a point and quickly confiscated what was left of "the so-called bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victim, but two American anti-terrorist officers quoted an unidentified witness who said that Somali was dead.
Somali was reported as a highly built planner of al-Qaida military operations, which conducted an operation of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in renovating throughout the world, said a senior official who does not wish to be appointed, who indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaida High Command and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somalia quickly progressed in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a generally known person for some Americans, but that in any way he did not reduce himself to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high leader of al-Qaida or Taliban that should be killed since September when Najmudin Jalov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of a military fraction in the zone of indigenous tribes and three other top opperative leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by CIA using unmanned aircraft has declined from years to an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to the record of the daily Long War, the website, managed by a non-profit group.
Reducing may have reason for improving the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by killing people who were suspected to be informants, also misplaced.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
On Friday, the United Nations University delegation in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated that he wanted to withdraw from his office in March and thus end the stormy term of office, which had been mutilated by large-scale corruption charges at the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it supported the increase but expressed concern that the US schedule for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw its strength.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, said Eide in the phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping to transform Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, said.
Eide said he was not going to resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008, that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look around after his successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started searching for a refund.
The officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturou, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, Frenchman, who had led the UN peace operation before that.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won in the country's presidential elections from masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but stated that Galgraith's accusations -- which was released -- clearly damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skeptic with regard to international intervention at the election.
Eide said that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for the coordination of a delay in the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also instructed the UN to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so, as he says, would like to strengthen their trust that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the restriction of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN regulation on recruitment undermines its ability to use capacity.
UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world power will soon lay "another significant sanctions" due to the lack of involvement in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's drive to areas where war in Afghanistan and Iraq, have bagated the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's question for probable development.
One thing that depends on me is whether I have learned about Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an inseparable insurrection in the war.
Obama administration decides on a package of sanctions that could interfere with the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that the "ball incentives and restraints" would require "that the Iranian government really feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will suffer extra sanctions."
According to the Friday's opinion, published by spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, administration has engaged the European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to interviews about the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his supplies of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration was responsible for such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between the two parties and obtaining time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to depart from the provisional agreements - partly because it presents an expert because the Irish leadership has been divided into the views of whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, as regards the Irish toughness of the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think that this brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, has been said by Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections including surveillance, which the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'degrading sanctions'.
In an opinion issued in New York City, Iran's UN mission condemned on Thursday what she called 'unreasonable and unincriminate charges' in front of some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and said that she wanted to continue to discuss with the United States and five other global powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before he flew to Kurdistan, rich in oil to meet with soldiers in Kirk and the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
There is still high tension between Kurdy and Iraq’s Arab majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent the United States from delaying its plans to reduce the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to suppress Kurdish concern with persistent depression. The U.S. official site quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaana, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which they read that "The Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One child also means one more grave".
Then they learned that when official government sites in Shanghai were alerted by low birth rates and ageing populations in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their reaction was instantaneous and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't leave anything for each other, says Wang, 31 years old, human resources manager, who has a eight-month son.
For more than 30 years, China’s ongoing policy to have only one child has been introduced, creating only two generations of non-tumbling and depraved children, affected by the nicknamed "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple compared to six, compared to those in politics, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population aged 60 years and above is forecast to grow rapidly from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
Imbalance is greater than rich coastal cities with higher education populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and over formed almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered inhabitants, while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said, many couples must have children in order to "help reduce the proportion of ageing population and reduce the number of labor in the future".
He says it's about being old doesn't mean being rich -- like developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual calming
As it was put into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate introduced under the regime of the Communist Party.
Doubles who violated policies faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese official sites promoted a policy that helped the country to prevent the critical use of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned in the promotion of politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion during the second child.
In addition, many couples had to have sexistly selected abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men against women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their opinion on the politics of one child.
In 2004, they generally called for exceptions - including residents of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were onlys -- and in 2007 they reduced the dispensation of their passwords, provoking hard lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research of the Beijing University, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, if one of their partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to stimulate more birth.
Almost overnight posters were posters, offering parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailed information on how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent out officers for family planning and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officers said.
Deploring response
Although officials in one rural town in Shanghai noticed an increase in interest in couples who wanted to have a second child after the campaign started, most city districts did not report any changes.
Huinan district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
The disappointed officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai family planning committee, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best thing to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that she would like two children and that was legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, who have only insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a limited capacity network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the politics of one child badly as a disputed legal question, says Yang, an engineer whose wife is 7 months pregnant in union with the first child.
Yes, we were moved to have a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples say psychological reasons for weight loss.
Wang, human resources manager, says they only want one child, because she was also an only child: "We were at the center of the attention of our families and all cared for us.
We weren't used to provide care, and in fact, we didn't want to take care of each other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who was the lead translation company, expressed this much more uncovered.
For middle - class parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of growing up, they look at their parents as having experienced the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child putting enormous requirements on parents' time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still questionable questions of propostor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You must have a resumption ready at the time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to make peace with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher levels of nutrients, he says.
We don't want to bring too many casualties.
The UN group has set out a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterised by far-reaching attitudes and mutual concentration -- focused again on the release of a document proposed by ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, bearing most of the burden on the nearest date.
The text that can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it was seen important progress in the negotiations, which took place at a wrong time with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by ad hoc working group, this text shows inconclusive how much money the rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choice for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies, in order to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit for the increase in global temperatures that policy leaders will still be able to tolerate.
This will deliver a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, head of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zamit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, restructed from 180 pages of the text of the negotiations on focusing on what top-rate UN climate officials, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines the possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
On Friday, the European Union discussed the promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries to adopt adaptation to climate change -- from overcoming floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still Friday he introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that they considered during interviews last week.
Mr Todd Stern rejected the speech requiring binding greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to volunteering in the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that Obama administration had established a more harsh line towards China, being officials of Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the execution of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be reviewed by external observers.
Stern made this comment hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei, who gave the U.S. Chief Negotiator an hour ago, that either the lack of 'ssensic' or 'mmotive inresponsibilities' had led earlier in the week to report that the United States would not be able to help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic paths of the world's main power in stake, the tahaics broke both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle mostly takes place to preserve individual economies rather than to preserve the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that two tens of the most influential countries of the world ignore scientific imperatives to carry out the most powerful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as regional advisers for regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they would like to continue to promote legally binding agreements in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants, said that the best result of the talks would be political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who led international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "vocal political struggle for the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations gave rise to a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the remaining disputed issues before the heads of the government are applied to the agreement.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Rames and Chinese Deputy Minister, came out of the planes and took place in Bella's Centre Halls to a closed door meeting and new conferences so that they could lay out the claims to be assessed next week.
The total wideness of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from and to the convention centre every day, at guitars playing activists in the night produced an ironing view of the countries that they thought had sent them out, and they came to pass proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than an electronic mail -- controlled by a challenge.
Intensity is only a foundation: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Protection.
There's heavy weight coming.
British first train with 140 miles an hour ago defined this Monday feelings
At 5:13 on Monday morning, the field of expertise cut through the dark on the sign of departure of the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford to Kent in London St Pancras and overcome the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high speed passenger kit outside of lLdnyn.
He hopes that the new service, if necessary, will connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the Velke agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The forgotten standing water should reduce passenger transport times and trade routes and transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties have been given the opportunity to obtain this vision.
But dozens of pounds, needed to build a new national rail network, an inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption, have now prevented the building of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realistic study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times said.
It provided him with a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland was designed to reach five metres in urban areas and quarters, where it could be problematic to catch up on the environment.
The open landscape was scheduled for up to 25 m final route.
The HS2 also foresees three choices for the extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is the Y-shaped calibration, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north to Sheffield, Leedsu and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems the most efficient choice has occurred," he said and found the railways.
As soon as this is done, the time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced for two hours and 40 minutes.
The first step, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than once an hour in presence.
The proposals should allow trains to travel 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to lift trains of 400 m which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate on the London Birmingham track every hour.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital restriction, the existing station would be expected to extend so as to capture a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
The Lord Adonis will notify whether it is intended or not to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that what final decision is not in the face of general choices.
Even if it takes the wheels to move, the network should build after parts.
Trains should first be put in service not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain running times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a decisive point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution to the railway.
Tax taxpayers have paid a mortgage of £75000 on Tory Oranges
Alan Duncan, holders of the Tory’s leading seats in the Chamber of Deputies paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his home in the electoral district.
spokesperson for a prison that was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members lived "out of rations", increased their mortgage to £75,000 to build a oak grounded expansion in their second home in Rutland.
It was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The general authorities approved claims in time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who performed the audit of Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr Duncan stated his demands "menohled it to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two substations on the village in his election district Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There's a kitchen on the ground floor, a living room and a dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is referred to as an "arangement" in the plans.
The neighbors describe it as a "skle for entertainment and smoking".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for an increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that it had infringed the rules after reviewing its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupilary mortgage of £271406 from his estate in London to his home in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan was entitled to approximately £1,400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to over GBP 1800 per month.
Mr Duncan's interest in RBS's mortgage could not change at this time, indicating that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS repayment of the mortgage decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of that year, while remaining.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds per month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after one secret rapporteur filmed him and said that the Members must survive "at ration" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on rationing and treat you like a s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden and claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as a oil merchant, was first invited to explain his issues in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before approval by the financial authority, that it could be "it could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound mark in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after he discovered he claimed £4,000 for a period of three years.
When he was asked to increase his mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved both by the financial office and then by Legg."
He added: "This is not a matter of hiding and clinging or breaking rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, by the rules, and that's all.
It would not be able to be cleaner or simpler in many other ways."
Come and see the cottage on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
Coast cottages in Brighton found a new sense of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates proud exploitation with creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas bikes as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when visitors allowed to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 1830 every day, and bishop's bread and cooked wine, provided free of charge.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cabin represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant to television marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in the Christian society.
"Why are we to expect as church that people will come into an old building, and I feel that the Church should come to people and serve in an upbuilding way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some of the friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday with demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, was demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30 thousand people according to police resources and a hundred thousand according to the organizers were manifesting in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims at adopting them by Friday an agreement which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the president of the climate conference, stated that growing global mobilisation, which is clearly evidence of today's manifestation, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of potential failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the journalist AFP there was an incident in the Danish capital shortly after the opening of the parade, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began to break up the features of the tiles and hammers.
The police have immediately hit the orderly police.
In total, the police announced arrests of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraradial separate groups, which had already been shown in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Kolice Climate Justice Action, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in pilgrimages and in the seat "held in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winters.
After leaving Parliament, the parade set out in a peaceful direction to Bella Center, where negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped by about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
For speakers there was a podium before which there was a spiritual meeting in candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from large European cities, and besides Africans there was also a large number of Asian participants, including several Chinese and Korean.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue coats were created in the morning in Copenhagen's first meeting at the call of the Friends of the Earth who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favour of the south, explaining the People of Nacpilová, the Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying, "It's time for that, she declared Angelique Kidjo's song.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry out, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the objective of "connecting climate and social justice". "Now, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Tish region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people came out of the streets by organizers.
In Manile there were several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves that evocative the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada several hundreds of protesters came out of the street and asked for a strong measure against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the movement "350" attended hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (exhibition).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia chooses her president, Georgia condemns it as a "frasku"
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, approximately a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as an independent in Georgia, Tbilisi asserts this step as a "frašku".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in the first elections after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 on control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The selection rooms were closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abchasian Election Commission, a few hours before the closure of the 58% electoral rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office of Bagapshe, reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned these elections.
These choices are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili " regrets that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian rule," said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgalagaz.
In addition to Russia, they recognised the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants only of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after a conflict in 1992-1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the letter AFP Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to vote for President Bagapse.
She was one of those who came to vote for an election room in a school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian rule is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can proudly be a wonderful nature.
Throughout this small country, 216,000 inhabitants are deployed huge billboards with Bagapš next to the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who had come to oversee the escalation of the elections, had received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, Abkhaz, have said thanks at a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to acknowledge the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexey Ostrovskii, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank a glass vodka for it.
The opposition, represented by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimbou and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou, criticized contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhaza railway network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't even support the current government or opposition.
To win elections, a supersonic majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Klima: manifestation in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday with demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, was demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30 thousand people according to police resources and a hundred thousand according to organizers have manifested in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which will host until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade set out in a peaceful direction to Bella Center, where negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped by about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.

According to the journalist AFP there was an incident shortly after the parade, when a group of several hundred protestors, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break up the exhibits.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, and several manifests hit the ground.
In total, the police announced arrests of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraradial separate groups, which had already been shown in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Later this afternoon, one cop on the jaw was injured, and four cars were burned near a squat located near the incidents that had been held by some 20 persons.
We focus on extremist groups, warned the spokesperson of Henrik Jakobsen, while helicopters of the police have been blown up again.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Korean or African.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue coats were created in the morning in Copenhagen's first meeting at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".

French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the objective of "connecting climate and social justice". "Now, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The Oxfam organization has called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Tish region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people came out of the streets by organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people were manifested before the City Council of Philippines, mostly students in red clothes, and scarves of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta several hundreds of protesters also met with the request for strong action against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the movement "350" attended hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (exhibition).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
The subjects of the geography and history will be strengthened in the framework of the reform of the general gymnastics, said Chatel.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during the interview for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" during the reform of general gymnastics, although their teaching will no longer be required in the last year of gymnastics to focus on exact science.
Now all students will have a second year of four hours a week, and for all they will also have the same program of general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end up with hypocrisy" because he thinks specialization S is no longer focused on exact science," but "in essence they are the best students".
The EC and L specializations cannot be a sub-specialisation for S, continues and emphasises: "I have brought many historians and intellectuals who would have complained that in the last year of professional gymnastics, they do not learn the history and geography."
Ifop survey, which published on Saturday the Humanité daily, showed that seven French out of 10 (69%) disagreed with the government's project to cancel the mandatory history and geography teaching in S's senior year, and therefore many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation as well as some members of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no account is taken" to cancel philosophy in the specialization program With a senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation on Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which, according to them, sacrificed pedagogical education for future professors of gymnastics.
As part of Master's Study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, the student exam will be focused on their field and, at the end of the year, another test to verify their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
He will participate in professional internships during the second year of Master's studies and will perform as a professor in front of students.
If you read all the internships that will be offered to you prior to the admission procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continue.
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which so far does not exist in national education.
Re-confirmed the school map cancellation project by 2012.
At the elite university, the École normals of the Supérieure have 15 minutes to convince them about climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge that Jean Joulel announced in the sobor of the morning, the multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole Standarde Supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one journalist informed AFP, the Nobel Prize winner Jean Joulel opened the first "Ernest" conference, which is a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions from experts, which will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and based on the greater desire to learn more, he explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received the name according to the fish from the local pond, which the students so named.
He selected about twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines and specified that the selection was based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk hours, but we can also sum up the basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Joulel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very serious scientific foundations".
Videos filmed on these lectures will be placed on the school website since December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February, and others will follow the regularity of each two months.
Payments delay: angry prison overseers, planned measures
Prison overseers' unions announced on Friday 'general mobilization' because they demand that their premiums and overtime be paid to them by Christmas holidays for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Boards of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to attend demonstrations held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities, and to "block them" and warn them of "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison overseers (3rd Departments of this sector) is asked to call together in individual prisons and to launch a major mobilization with the fact that it is "student and unacceptable" in order to "intervention and allowance for work at night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October, not to be paid in December.
The first Board of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), calls for overall mobilization... in order to show dissatisfaction and grievousness.
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mariová sent a message to the prison overseers, in which it assures them that the payment will be made next month.
I know about the efforts the prison personnel are making to ensure the operation and modernisation of our prison system, writing to the Minister in his communication.
I have ordered the administrative directorship of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that the situation which resulted from the wrong evaluation of the number of overtime has never repeated in the future has been added to the Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive the famous premium for performing functions and objectives, reports Ufap/Unsa, and for those "in the budget there will always be a place".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille got hot and announced its decision to boycott into the appeal of "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays if they will not be paid in December for these days of October, as well as overtime, there is also FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we get more and more work done and more tasks without giving us additional staff available, it is sad to allow the lowest employee status to pay for it, reports CGT-Winter overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, the funds are little, the Secretary General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says she gives "better presents" for Christmas than the ones she gets.
American President Barack Obama, who is getting ready for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, believed the "Goddess" screen of Oprah Winfrey that, as far as gifts are concerned, has a simple rule: "I give better presents than the ones I get".
The President and his wife Michelle spoke on a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious housing.
Even Bo, a small four-legged family gets its share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said with the fact that the doggie also "of course" will receive a gift, as is the result of the entertainments from the preliminary broadcast show.
And Michelle Obama also retaliated against her husband's statement on the quality of gifts she gets: "So I'm sure you didn't, last year I gave you nice gifts," she used to smother the president.
That's right, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after humor, he showed a finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show, with the famous moderator, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama husbands also spoke about their most popular gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama gave a round with a ten-step transferer, but also a basketball ball, dedicated to him at Christmas to his Kenyan father, with whom he was rarely meeting.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me that basketball ball, told the president.
For a long time after I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady was reminiscing the doll house.
I didn't know how to organize all this in the house, so I ran all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, and I reminded Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday is being operated again, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep.
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to the "surveillance" created after a larger operation in France, but the situation is according to his nearest "control" while RTL stations indicated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
66-year-old rocker was again operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had put in place the "survivor resulting from the operation" of the warm gossip that he had done in Paris on 26 November, told his press department in Paris, with the fact that these lesions required "real operation".
However, the singing press department tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "controllable" and announced that new medical communications would be issued by 48 hours at the latest.
According to the station RTL, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to avoid "the pains and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little bit more certainty, she'll add an X-ray.
The Press Department did not confirm this information or comment on the request of AFP.
RTL also states that, according to "some resources", no drains were placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monk International Clinic for a warm rumor.
The operation, which has been scheduled for several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information of RTL.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday on the RTL radio that his boyfriend was just going through "bad season," but he added that he was worried about rocker 'unsorbed' because that's a big "caliber."
He called me just before he flew to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane for such an operation is no fun, he told Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laetici, his wife's singer, and he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer are only multiple since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after the fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of the thin intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his bachelorettes.
But since then, every health problem has been closely monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty in moving on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to comment again on the new hospitalization report.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal player at the 2009 World Championship in a large pool, won a title on Thursday at the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the suits were last allowed, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them won the Hungarian race, Evelyn Verrasztová, 200 m positioning race, and two of the rest of Russia's men's shed at 4x50 m positioning race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who made a world record of 50 m free, which already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines swimming, 50m free way, the 28-year-old French won 20,53 seconds in the final finale, on which ten swimmers started instead of regular eight.
Bousquet beat Chorvava Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russia Sergeje Fesikov (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was in my reach, I'd try it.
Just like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore combinations made of polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
The mergers helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to hold them at the same competition in 1999.
Using the combination this time did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, twice the world's master in a large pool in Rome in summer, who had a world record at the reach of his hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds on to 400 metres free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsem Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I wouldn't finish the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and do my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival to the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: A record of the Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zolov was auctioned at USD 1.5 million
The board of Roman sarcophage, which did not belong to anyone other than French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is significantly more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby ́s.
The price of this two meter long and 63 cm high front plate, coming from the third century of our summer, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "premises four Dionysian scenes in an advanced architectural decoration, surrounded by satirium and bacchants is a rare piece, similar to the world is very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florence Heintz, Vice-President auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The plot was sold between a hundred others.
The sale is still in progress, but it is an object that has been applied to about the most, has communicated to the Agency AFP spokesperson Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola took this marble was detected several days ago.
The board was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated with it in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and shortly the President of the Council before taking power to Marshal Petaine.
That's where she's been painted for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered when searching the museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "remains of Emila Zoly" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and fresco "Roulon-Macquart".
A continued attempt to leave President Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, which rebels refused to guarantee safe exit, were not fulfilled.
After a phone interview that I had with President Zelaya last night, everything suggests for now that there is no way to make this transfer, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which flew on Wednesday to Salvador for President Zelaya again, said the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Pučist government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with the possibility of a safe departure.
But the rejected president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The government of pučists "has experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my function (...), wanted me to deliver a dementia", said Zelaya Radio Globo on Thursday, in which she often speaks to a political crisis that lasts for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, he added a rejected president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucipalpa for two and a half months, and played some accordions.
The embassy Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for a safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not contain an application for asylum, said in the middle of the Minister of the Pučistic Government, Oscar Raul Matute Honduras Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station, which has its seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as President of the Honduras People, he stressed.
The rumors of the departure of Zelaya have mobilized at the center of the supporters of the rejected president, who have come to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army has strengthened protection.
Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amori, criticized the position of the coup government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who was approached by the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was thrown down on June 28th, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-electivation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21st and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he's gonna be arrested and responsible for the crime of "instruction" from which he's charged, he claims a pučistic government.
On November 29th, the President-in-Office of Robert Micheletti managed to hold President Zelay's presidential election to replace.
In controversial elections, recognised by the United States, but condemned countries of Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balances are encouraging optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the US business balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented by Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she did, because the market is focused on half a glass.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on the numbers of American business balance, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit dropped in October by 7.6% compared to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected an increase in deficits.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
Great news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Economics.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment grew against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474.000.
In the last four weeks, however, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "at the lowest in this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market also dropped.
The proceeds of the Treasury with a view to 10 years have increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield to 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% of the day before that.
Cuba : hundreds of advocates of the regime have exclaimed "The Houses of White"
Several hundred Cuban advocates recorded on Thursday the political prisoners' wife, who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day, preventing further manifestations from being arrested by dozens of dissidents.
Some 40 "Dam in white", wives or nearby political prisoners were fired right on the street by the advocates of the Raul Castro regime on their march towards the capital center with a request to release political prisoners, informed the journalist.
Gone with Yankees!, "Followers!", "The streets belong to revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" squandered the raised fists of regime advocates to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to secure security.
The day before that, in Havana, there was similar manifestations against "The House of White", but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, police members were arrested in the civilian community of about ten dissidents who were also going to manifest themselves on Thursday on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day, informed the journalist AFP.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who were denied the advocates of the government regime in civilian vehicles using force.
Discontinuation of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours.
Sakharov Prize holders for 2005, "The White Houses" organized an illegal march for "the release of all, according to the dispensary, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is investigating the sentence of 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom still remains behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "gifts" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
Hot wonder, Cuban television has brought a report on the Thursday demonstration of advocates of the government regime against the "receptors of the revolution".
Cuba is regularly accused of non-respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, with the leadership and policies of the government of one party.
A madman killed a 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A lunatic armed with two knives killed a 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results from the investigation, an attacker at the age of 28, allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in a pharmacy or before, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is a police and witnesses version.
A badly injured old man born in 1929 died according to the police syndicate of Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this pharmacy or before it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of about thirty, his husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where a 80-year-old man died.
The second injured person's life is in danger, according to police sources, apparently, was hit by vital organs.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
Armed with a man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still to Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He hurt two more, apparently, thirty-and-four-year-old man, the other seriously.
As it all occurred, it is not entirely clear, for everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried the cross behind his back, said at the point leading the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw, like, a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They didn't succeed because he was pretty strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob, including one of the city policemen who broke his wrist, added it.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of heading 61, with two city police officers, including their commander, tried to hold a armed man and were injured with fists, introduced a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The walkers came to tell me there's a wounded person out there.
I went out, and I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large wound on my belly, told the agency AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the other one, about thirty-year-old, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have IDs arrested after state police.
The National Representative of Nanterre referred the matter to the Department of Investigation of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect attacker was transported to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source didn't rule out his location at the psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said there was a need for six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transported.
He was "overself" as "all madmen of this type whose strength in action increases 10 times."
US: Polish lawyer once again asks for termination of criminal prosecution
The Polish-French director Roman Polanski again requested on Thursdays in Los Angeles (Kalifornia, West United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, currently located in his Swiss residence due to the moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the film director "Pianist" criticized serious mistakes before three judges of the appeal court of the second period in California during court trial at the time of the event in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and now, he told Hummel's lawyer and added that from the behavior of the judge who decided at that time, Laurence Rittenband "had a stroke in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died between this) allegedly treat a state attorney who told him that Roman Polanski deserves to go to prison – a serious violation against the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: vanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the state attorney himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally stated at the end of September that "he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will require the court's trial, in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was already said at the first state, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski was brought to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before giving judgment in the matter of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with an underage girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
The prosecutor's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "that he should be there to attend trial."
We want to tell not only Roman Poles in this case, but also another defendant that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asked.
He believes the director is asking for kindness after court and also despises his authority.
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
The lawyer Hummel was not alone who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's attorney Samantha Geimer also once again requested termination of criminal prosecution.
She reminded that her client will no longer bear the perpetual harassment every time a Polanski case emerges and added: "Nobody in this room can say that the trial was just".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26th September in Switzerland on a U.S. command
For more than two months behind bars, he was released into his home jail in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible demonstration.
Wall Street ends without direction, holding it rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a direction, the market is reflected between indicators that are better than the US expected and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.33%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index has increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of the Marblehead Asset Management.
It stays in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that were better than expected and which "helped to improve market mood with regard to the stability of economic recovery," summarised Charles Schwab.
In November, retail markets grew by 1.3% in the USA, and it was already the second month after each other and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers also returned and increased strongly in December to 73,4 against 67,4 in the previous month.
Indexes, however, were struck by a new rise in the price of the dollar towards the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are thus losing land under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The return of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
The Miss World election again in South Africa.
After monthly travel across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World on Saturday are going to cross the finish line to reach their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has taken place in Johannesburg for the second year and for the time being five candidates have made progress in the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargboová of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratra and Yanbing Maová from Canada were chosen Miss sport or Miss Top model during their African stay.
It was a true vortex of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen so many things, and I have so many experiences!
The competition that takes place in South Africa after 9th will be broadcast on the direct transmission from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17th hour (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country in which I would plant a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I could have experienced it twice, believed Miss Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was held in the spirit of numerous encounters with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "country that reflects the breath".
After months of performances, trials, press meetings and safari now Miss focuses on the contest itself.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in Priyanka Chopra's steps, elected in 2000, which also participated in Aishwarye Rai's election, the winners of 1994, both of which became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman of the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just appearance.
We are the ambassador of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimmers.
The presentation will be introduced by Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of South Africa's beauty Michelle McLean and Chairman of the Committee of the world Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with warmth, which is difficult to deal with, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates participated in the safari last year, visited the famous Soweto town, this time on a bike, and tasted local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zumou, who was shaking their hands.
For the President, unusually, she meant Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory remains in Cape Town (in the South West) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country’s event to promote something more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I'm sure I'm going back to World Cup 2010, saying with Miss Italy Alice Tatacchi's enthusiasm.
According to David's son, the Hallyday state reports are "very positive".
The reports on Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as David's son assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport inLos Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
Reports are very positive.
It is very strong and everything takes place very well, declared David Hallyday when performing from the plane that arrived from Paris a moment after 13th hour of local time (21th hour of world time)
The singer's son, who was free to act, declared that "as quickly as possible" would reach the Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to post-op infection following the operation of a warm inter-bratillary gossip that he entered on 26 November in Paris.
According to the press release, the night in Los Angeles was singing because of the comfort of "inducted into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a medical examiner at Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. Hospitalization was due to post-op infection caused by a warm interbradial rumor made on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer must have been operated again at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a French lyce show in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
The priority of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrire, Yves Catony, announced that he was leaving for the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer was responsible for Dr Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who worked on Clinique internationale du parc Monkau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles said they were knocked up, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday" took off too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I spoke to my doctor on a phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I had already already suffered twice the victory of the interbratilla gossip, added.
A while earlier on the station, the RTL said that the singer probably left for the Paris operation without a drone, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in the artistic circles.
He operated the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius several days before she died at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working for at that time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg also operated as an actress in the removal of hematoma caused by brain bleeding.
However, it is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times condemned in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The doctor's attorney Olivier Metzner named him "man without scruples", which is "really" referred to before the medical chamber, and which cannot be further recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux expressed his point on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "probably good course" and postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not have to be introduced", he added.
The health problems of the singer have been growing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that another tour remains with the question.
It is obvious that the date for the renewal of the scheduled tour on January 8th (Amenens, ref. red.) appears to be too close, Camus declared.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls on the side of the Nouveau Centre not to take advantage of the shortcut.
On Friday, UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançaise Bayroua, responded to the attempt by President Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina to take the shortcut of the former Giscard Party, with the fact that the shortcut must not be used in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF shortcut with the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her inheritance after he gave his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, had the plan to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has been supported by Mr Hervé de Charett (expert for the NC), who is signing the ownership of the UDF brand since it was first registered at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004 (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday night, the UDF Association Committee, managed by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of getting out, stepped out of his silence and filed a formal request from the Minister and Members to stop using the shortcut and to transfer the ownership of the trademarks, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statement that you will propose to your political movement +brew+ take over the shortcut of UDF, writes the Association in your letter signed by 19 those of the 24 Committee members, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional material and on the welcoming website of your movement name+Nouveau centre+, with slogan +UDD today+, they also include a letter signatories.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement, and immediately remove all the mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (savvy) website".
At the same time, Hervé de Charette's request is "to hand over the trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of the members of UDF, draw attention to signatories.
In their letter, UDF states that "is a full political movement since 1978" and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected "the departure in 2007" to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to establish an UMP.
The Nouveau movement has therefore no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la démoratie française).
They also point out that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for the connection to MoD for three years and for the creation of a committee responsible for defending "moral and material interests" of the Valéry Giscard d'Estaing association.
As for Hervé de Charette, the Committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", he was not "three years of UDF", but the UMP.
The scandalous and fraudulent way of using the non-existent acrony registration to do so on his own account.
This inconsistencies begin to transform into a crime, declare, and then with irony speak to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in normal life it is more valuable to create a name for themselves than to turn out from anonymity by fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we do not have the right".
The Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and make a ruling on whether he had taken advantage of the weakness of the 80-year-old billionaires to prepare for part of her property, of which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him.
Photograph (62 years), known for its photos will be judged on 15th and 16th April 2010 for the abuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a penalty is imposed at a maximum of 3 years and a penalty of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that it will actually take place in the case process, which can be referred to as the family pool of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are attacked and is fighting for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The grandfather and major shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to carry out such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State representation in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he's gonna get hit.
I'm going to talk to her about the matter, and after the hearing, he declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer Georges Kiejman.
As for lawyer François Bettencourt, Olivier Metnář, the court welcomed the decision.
It's an excellent report(...). The experiment will show that with this old lady who needs protection he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It is two years since the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-employee whom he blames for years using her mother's weakness to get a billion euros in the form of checks, contracts for life insurance or picture masters.
But Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be a photographer, whom she considered to be a long-term friend, to be manipulated.
While the court had to assess the legality of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the court's hearing of lawyers changed to the family hour of truth.
The lawyer, Liliana Bettencourt, presented three letters, which his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent her notary, and in which she expressed her distrust against her husband François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, she adds: "You can explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once and twice a day.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to François."
The State representation in Nanterre has again found that the action of the complainant is not justified, more so that the custody judge has rejected her application for the initiation of proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely able to participate in court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her", confirmed the D.A., Marie-Christine Daubigney.
In the end, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would express themselves at the time of the opening of the trial.
Manager revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence's development was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, it has been recalled that the management of large companies against employees has been regressive against consumers: it is a matter that co-workers should identify themselves with "values" from the mountain, as was the earlier time when the consumer had to be forced to make products which came from the ideas of factory technology.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the customer compared the marketing revolution of the strategy to reach the market in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, they return regularly!
The passive approach of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which predominantly affects managerial agendas.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders... an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires employees to be completely contrary to the income of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should lead the workers to the business centre as well as the customer.
Relative usefulness of public opinion internal surveys.
Internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Just because I've convinced myself that, face to face a new situation, the structure will return first to what it's always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, increases proportionately with the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of universities for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of mental comfort, they have developed an old behavioral theory, now reanimated by "incracies" from the US, and widely disseminated without greater knowledge by scientific institutes and media.
With the possibility of moving "powders" (sic) involvement of managers, Ipsos has shown recent research on Figaro.fr's website, which is merely placing managers in their position of mechanical management, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the final vision of human behavior.
It consists of the inclusion of a basic observation into all intentions and practice of the management : Only if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects will be possible for employees.
Currently, this concept of motivation for employees deals only with studies Motivatively functional analyses.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of predetermined amounts that will enable them to, by means of an image that tells about the undertaking, to assess what it offers them to achieve their living goals.
Due to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilisation, management workers can control, anticipate and interfere with their "social performance" and indicate their management of human resources on the right path.
This creates a living land for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
The expression from Oslo: 'just war' Obama earned praise from the right hand.
On Friday, the American Rightice welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented the day before that in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 was defending the concept of 'just war' against the enemies of the United States.
Consumers, who first laughed at the award of Obama on 9 October, this time the presidential speech was clashed, including Sarah Palin, former Vice President in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. daily, and she added that she herself expressed itself on this topic "almost necessary" war in her memorys which are currently coming out.
The war, of course, is the last thing Americans would want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorsGeorge W. Bush, in Thursday in Oslo, justifies sending another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before he made his decision.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, has assessed that the President has done a very good job in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated by former President of the House of Representatives, who mainly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech historically, declared Gingrich during the interview on Radio "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see the "left President" recalling to the members of the Nobel Committee the Nobel Prize, that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "a great American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "worlder" as always, but "speak as an American president" and reminded the Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to keep it," he evaluated Gerson.
Some of the few dissatisfactions of the right include the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who referred to the speech as "unifying, depraved and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled by the view of Barack Obama, as justified by the use of force.
"We can easily justify the massacre of innocent people when we put war into the cover of justice," he warned.
However, the medium left press is holding an opinion against the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama as premature, it has assessed its output as a "excess" even for a speaker known by his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in combating poverty and oppression", the California daily incubated by the California daily.
Obama "presented what was needed," evaluated the New York Times, and said the speech "for simple and educational".
Road carriers: three maratons to an agreement to save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three actions, road haulage and TLF were completed, the only employer organisation left until the end, on Friday evening, to an agreement which ended the call for strike and threat that hanged over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, spoke on Friday's signing of the agreement 'radiance' after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning, hoping that the wording of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Even though the three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) resigned from the meeting.
But more than six hours of the meeting was needed, which began at 11 o'clock, so that everyone could agree and sign an agreement at 18 o'clock.
This conflict "will hurt businesses very much" and "the danger of being disturbed by holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text text includes a 4% increase in the lowest wage (local and regional road transport) and a 2% increase in the highest salary (International Transport).
The wage per hour at the lowest salary is increased from 8.72 EUR to 9,06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members orders not to block, no supply centers block.
But there may be several opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit an increase in high wages due to the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month at the lowest wage and by EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic Agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a re-evaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow attention to the question of 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the '100 million euro reduction on corporate wages', which was the subject of an amendment to the Government's amendment to the 2009 Budget Act, which was voted on Thursday at the National Assembly's Friday night.
The government will ask the Senate for a 'suitable' vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will apply first to undertakings which are members of this organisation, later to the whole department, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It's going to be "in as short a time as possible", guaranteed Bussereau.
The whole process can only sound disapproval of employers' organisations.
FNTR is talking about "bad shop" because 100 million euros "the sector has been offered as part of carbon tax compensation".
The Transport Secretary made us do an emergency act, not due to an analysis of each other, but because of the fact that the turkeys did not inflamed at the time of Christmas holidays, the Unostra complained.
To Otre, the agreement in the next 12 months threatens to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field.
RER A passenger trains: traffic interruptions on weekends, trade unions are not satisfied with RATP's proposals.
The traffic interruption at the RER A station, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend as Friday negotiations between the trade unions and the management of the RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the request for a premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, therefore days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will ride only between 10th and 20th hours, on the main section (direction La Défence and Nation) will ride each second train, outside this section only one train from four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Business homes Galeries Lafayette, who are expecting more than 200,000 customers each day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP was trying to secure a connection with the big business homes".
RER A lines lead from the west to the east of Paris' agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train was in operation at the top of the road from two, and virtually no kit took place at the time off the top, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France were otherwise arranged and there was no confusion in the successors.
So early in the morning, there were many fewer people than usual in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, including because they lacked students and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up for "an hour and a half sooner to be sure he would arrive in time".
Saint-Lazare's charge was not overfilled, she announced to SNCF State Railways, namely, the greater number of officials and officers of order has been foretold.
RER A passenger trains operated by SNCF in direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or traveled from Saint-Lazare Station with a connection to the metro.
The next general meeting of strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management, which the trade unions have rated as "weak".
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A train on all pages, adjustment of working time, career progress, etc.
This is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon.
RATP even put forward proposals on the premium for the time being, which made the CGT worse with the fact that the management "could not be able to solve the problem while travel carriers and SNCF were able to solve it".
For a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions of performance are reviewed" specified RATP transport companies.
Which was why the union officials thought the business was "make fun of weekends."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the corporate committee in his Paris mansion.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, was therefore decided for the meeting to be held in the interest of "commendation".
There is a danger that the conflict on Tuesday will spread even on the RER B line, after Unsa and Independents announce the strike emergency.
The trade unions demand a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independants (Independants) are complaining about the worsening working conditions on this line, which carries millions of passengers daily.
RER train drivers make €2200 to €2700 gross wages and €600 to €650 for irregular working hours and Sundays and holidays.
Turkey has dissolved its jurisdiction for the Kurdish party and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to cancel the main Pro-Kurd Party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the task of the government, which seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end the 25 years of conflict.
The Party to the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "phod of activities threatening the independence of the state and its non-unionable unity," said the journalists presidents of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when most of them were required for the dissolution of the party, Kiliç said and added that 37 party courts, including her President Ahmed Türk and Member of Aysela Tugluková had a ban on participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tukulvá and the seizure of the assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 chairs in Parliament (from 500).
The party's leadership has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Casual Court of Abdulman Yalcinkay, who blames DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Party (PKK), which Ankar and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political vitrion of rebels from PKK.
The Party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government grants a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and try to limit Kurd support to the PKK and to end the conflict.
DTP’s leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a re-establishment of tension in the south-east of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which the leaders of PKK Abdullah Öcalan were detained in conflict with the police in recent weeks.
Since the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the south-east, mostly Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov's cocktails again, or they fired stones from washing machines.
She also demonstrated about a hundred people in Istanbul.
Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice was just 'a deepen of desperation'.
Turkey cannot solve this question (Curds, notes red.) by prohibiting the parties, declared in the press.
The government, consisting of a party coming from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're under the principle of counter-distortion.
It doesn't mean anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shot at democratic proposals launched by the government, commented on Politologist Ahmet Insel.
Obviously, we can look forward to the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, PKK applied to one of the deadliest attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the Head of the FES Winter Department of Technical Services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
There are over 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to the exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt, the whole room and the temperatures fall below zero, they go out to the 20 so-called sections A torns, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and cross-country paths such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firemen, line of urban public transport, walking zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sleep with damp salt within a maximum of three hours, which is better held, about 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "that the road should be free when it starts to go to work."
It's difficult when he starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical service department, "because no one is willing to make space for the snipers."
Only when it doesn't snow so much, there's also Rat-Beil-Straße's access and connection communication.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES climbers, clean out dangerous places and transitions first.
FES can't usually take care of all the bikers.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg is quickly formed on them, the splinters leave immediately as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaurs collage
The tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animals long two metres and 1,50 metres high ran after two thick back limbs, had a long skull with sharp, bloated teeth, short front limbs with sick claws and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then found in the equator's dry dry area of the supercontinent.
The tawa opens a new window to an earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's showing us a lot about family relationships, enlargements, and the branding of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists started digging up at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, it's unwelcome for triass plantation, reports a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the dignified period, the remains were collected from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
It's an unusual find for Sterling Nesbitt: "Fosilia dinosaurs from the triass are very rare, mostly there are only single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this enthusiasm without reservations.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, therefore the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when even more have been divided into three most important development lines: carnivorous teropodia, which later belonged to Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long" four-legged saurpods and their relatives, and the Ornithichian bulls, such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
The tawa hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues' original therapy.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
In Tawa hallae's skull, researchers found evidence of air bags that also have offspring of teropod birds.
Air bags make the breathing of birds more effective than mammals.
The bones of the spine were also partially filled with air at the Tawa hallae.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lines of huge sauropods had later also air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was likely a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because so far known the most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists developed that even for the first time had appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all the continents, which as supercontinent to the Pagea were formed by a uniform Earth mass.
The fact would also speak to the fact that the team had found, together with Tawa Hallae, the remains of two others, not particularly closely related teropods.
The three cannot come from one common immigrationed ancestor, they argue scientists.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific studies.
Of course there are differences.
One more older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the hardest dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonský paleontologist Martin Sander.
His presumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs remained, with rarely found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs proved to have evolved from the relatively rare sideline of the plaice family to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the times of the Middle Ages, still remains a puzzle.
During the triass, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
A lot of new species have spread to the end of the trias and dinosaurs to the whole world, while relatives have died and the Triasus and the jury interface.
The History of Success did not last forever
There are two hypothesiss, as to how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could be mass extinction, which by chance survived by dinosaurs, but we don't.
Or the dinosaurs have made better adjustments, so they might have pushed out the competition.
As a matter of fact, the story of success did not last forever.
About 150 million years later, he helped hit a meteorite with another group of animals, which so developed in triass and lived in the shade since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
On the list are professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley, California.
They joined the doctors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brem.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University took care of the worldwide start.
278 professors and teaching Goeth universities, but also universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with protestors at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English "not praise" the presidious excited police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art were numbered, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, let the building that had been occupied last week by the alarming students and the lecturers.
In the meantime, five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories judge, do not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching students and teaching police commanders".
Clearance represents an "unacceptable intervention" to freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "righteousness and criminalisation of protest" and removes attention from content.
The bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The speaker calls to stop the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Authorized protest
Also, the youth trade unions Verdi and the German union solidarity with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for his own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hebrew Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the procedure of the University President and Police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destroying and deployment are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Akdellen Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden's dream.
We have understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, he told the Earth's Snowman Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, it was seen by the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Line.
CDU takes painted walls behind the excuse to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, it was clear.
Link made a proposal calling on the Minister of Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicone-Valley
For years, it paid for a secret city, not available to visitors from the west.
Zeronograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded site where secret arms research was conducted.
Today, it is considered this period with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres away from the Moscow center, as "Romani Silicon Valley".
There are major micro- and nanoelectronic research and manufacturing centres.
Since September 2008, Greengrads have already established contacts with the French scientific centre Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been multiple visits and signed on Wednesdays in Frankfurt Zelerograd and Ridberg "A Protocol on Close Cooperation".
Russia's delegation led the Moscow multi-star, Jurij Rosljak, and the prefect from Zeleograd Anatoli Smirnov, to Frankfurt, signed the Head of Planning Report Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will take part in scientific research in the seminar for Zeronograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be allowed to move to the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zeronograd is established by major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technologies, the large companies of the Sitronics and Rossiian Electronics.
The period was founded in 1958 as the so-called "social planning city" for military research.
Zeronograd (the literal translation of the "Green Town") gained its name according to the wooded hilly landscape, into which the research facilities are established.
Stuttgart brake
The Dimenze Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared enough at all.
For project supporters it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than launching a station, more than a monstrosic construction that will cast the capital of Badenska-Württemberska for one decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuart 21 was born in the spirit of the '80s.
The main railway station, which ended in the city center, was considered a transport-technical fossil of the 19th century, which acts as brakes of modern rail transport, because it was necessary enormously much time to move the locomotive from behind.
Pull over, stop a minute, move on, so it should work.
That's why the main station is disappearing in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about half the trans-European rail magistrates between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - that is why the slogan about the heart of Europe.
It really starts with S21, although the vision from the 1980s is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves learned that the construction is almost unfunded in the Hesenian and Bavarian city.
Since there are modern pendulum trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main station has no longer had problems with riding and driving.
Still: It begins with the Stuttgart 21 including the new line of ICE to Ulm.
They've leased it to the country and municipal politicians.
The path cooperates, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the country are borne by a taxpayer and not by a state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
A new urban space will emerge, which - if we believe in computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful to the railway transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which was typically due to a huge increase in the 1980s.
There was no competition for cheap flights at that time.
Modern transport policy must go but firstly on enhancing freight transport, because rail transport is far more greener than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of a sharp rise.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly touches a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Švábsk.
That's an official number.
The experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, the finances will be missing at the next node points and narrow spots in the network.
There are 60 bigger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has become a slow pace.
There's a need for hard pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of the bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
In Wiesbaden, the Earth Government has left the House open if it goes against the judgment of the Hesen Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of nighttime flights and has it revised.
CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400page judgment of VGH, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Cassela today explained in writing that the State would have had to re-adjust a night ban on flights in the case of a construction planned north-western runway in Frankfurt airport.
The permission of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as predicted by the Earth Government, does not conform to the law governing the protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and pointed to the representatives of the Government to terminate the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises concerning the ban on night flights she gave before the election. Otherwise, it can be assessed as "distortion of the word".
It's fucking hard, if you can keep up with your word, said the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wasir in the corner of the election slogan FDP "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's outflow, the Earth's government is trying to get to its overnight flights through "the twisting of rights and tricks".
The exact legal control takes time.
Koalice doesn't want to work on the basis of a quick first impression.
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His words to ban night flight ban were never the same as his opposition.
American banks repay aid
The US, the crises of the big banks are getting rid of the state bond.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid assistance from Tarp’s bank rescue fund totalling $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to the U.S. CNBC reports, Citigroup is planning to pay state aid.
In this way, the Constitutions want to rid themselves of the limits that have occurred with the adoption of money - the reduction of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has made good 19 billion dollars of clean money on investors thanks to the exchangeable bond.
The rest of the money she took from her cash register, which was filled, inter alia, thanks to the trade unions' sales.
The head of Kenneth Lewis bank specifically thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: Penalty Injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The pension institution has injured itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
The Citigroup also wants to exempt itself from its obligations to the State by taking care of money in the capital market.
The CNB reported with reference to resources that this US bank could report on Thursday the capital increase of about $20 billion.
The Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself to that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off.
Quick option
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed the editor-in-chief of Mr. Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the gremium wanted to agree to the person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was named favor.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so that it doesn't run a trial.
However, the role could also have been played by the fact that they did not want to harm the authorising officer of ZDF Markus Schächter if he did not pass this proposal on to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 grémy members.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter’s board of directors lost his proposal to extend the contract for another five years with Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members voted for Brenda, seven were against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter slaughter for Schächter, although she could have been expected.
The majority of the EU’s board of directors have signaled a few weeks before the election that she does not wish to confirm in Brenda’s office.
The resistance to the editor was organized by the Estonian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in office with a high-esteemed editor, arguing that Brenda's quotas for the ZDF reporting were dropped.
Therefore, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence of ZDF was clearly criticized.
Last time, 35 state-of-law lawyers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch's procedure as non-consistent.
It wasn't for nothing.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogical and romantic.
Then he worked for Südwestfak and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 transferred Frey to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent to the editor; 1991/92 a letterer in Washington; until 1998 the leader and moderator "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 the Head of Foreign Policy of ZDF; since then the Head of the ZDF main studio.
After Brender was elected on Wednesday by the expert periodical Medium Magazin journalist of the year, established, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional action.
Koch's counter-candidate in the Board of Directors, Rinysko-Falconian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal countries should change the state contract with ZDF so that the personnel proposals of the authorising officer cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Boards.
Brender’s expected successor, Peter Frey, broke the board with a smart chess move - immediately after Brender’s deployment, criticized the gremium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could no longer have been nominated for the director's seat without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In the party's arithmetic, Frey's unintended to the left-wing liberals.
The study is removed from the harp
Part-time success for students: After the year of strike, they finally entered the Federal Countries of Culture Ministers: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Directors both sides agreed that it was willing to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test load: As a rule, each study module should end with one test.
In addition, the work loads of students should be rechecked and 'real and defensive peace' guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal Countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural award for bachelor and master studies.
Earth derogations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the opening of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university speakers in the mouth have described words about a better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board found that the number of tests will be drastically reduced: "Every module will generally only be completed once a test", writes in the 30-page report, which has a new regulation of the approval of study fields.
"A very lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm's chair of the accreditation board, said, "a lack of development is to be stopped, which significantly reduces the complexity of the study."
To this end, the "tunity of study" in the future is to be a "deciding criterion" in the implementation.
Modulas as well as the content "has to carefully recheck" in order to "not limit the students properly when selecting
seminars."
Students should "a measure of space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules are to apply in the approval of new studies, after examination, but also for existing studies.
These need to be "accredited" every five years – but that means that it will last until 2015 before all study groups are reviewed.
The 10 accreditation agencies which are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Federal Countries.
In October, cultural ministers called on the “strength” federal countries to lead the agencies so that the filling of the exercise is not too big and the test regime is not strict.
In each country, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures by the Ministry of State.
As yet, the only country has promised Pork-Falco additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From money, universities should, above all, cover consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
That's what the countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010 he wants to bring a new amendment to Parliament of the Higher Law.
In its view, only one test should be needed for the completion of the study module.
Study formation should be even more flexible to ensure the recognition of tests from other universities and the availability of masters is to be made easier.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all the study fields in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition were again arguing on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, the criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups has asked that the development of education policy should not take place in the future "in closed doors" of ministers and universities.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should also be spoken by students as persons concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the conference of higher education speakers (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelová: "We need student experience", said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which HRK advised about a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Danish resolution did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow every graduate with the bachelor's degree to access the construction master's studies.
Secondly, the federal countries must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelor's students, enough seats are available in the Master's fields with the best study conditions, the member of the GEW Andreas Keller Board.
The Polish countries must employ far more lecturers.
But ministers of culture did not make their way to free access to master's programs.
More than the footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one poem poem by Werner Söllner, who has also lost his language environment in this persevered language group.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banátu, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a teacher of one child book publishing company, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan.
Söllner was awarded by various literary prices, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Franciscan Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesen Forum of Literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, a seminar in Munich, which included "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently, the concerned Söllner left a statement in front of colleagues from Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Tekek, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admits to cooperation as a secret informant for Romanian secret services.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language price in 1989.
The attempts to recruit were said to begin insignificant, first in 1971.
I was, uh, Söllner went on, "then someone who didn't fight enough to intimate himself from Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize given by Hert Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictator's government is a literary scene, and especially a community of German authors originating in Romania, has been shaken by a case that identifies the depth and disgrace of the political sytém, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if you can say that according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he's also a victim.
In Securitate's files, a secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to a positive influence on himself as secret agent Walter.
"He cut me" at all points at that time, says Markel.
My moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and before this publication, but the absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not unexpected.
Herta Muller wrote in July when she read her own records, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitat.
Touching, can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases probably know which name is hiding behind cover named Sorin, Voicu and just now Walter.
Other than in the home, in the meantime, a very certain examination of Staz's components is handling the estate of the Securitate control remains very diphurate.
In recent years, systematic education has been reduced and dreamy.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Ingredients (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, has been published since then rather long.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the management of components.
That the former Securitate members still have great influence in Romania, he added one interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, in which one of the former Securitate Chiefs of Temešvár expressed his refusal to accept the award.
My psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Power is expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as well as in the context of the silenced prosecution, raises inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets him expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine rather the desire for knowledge rather than after the sin and shame.
To the gene of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Strict Deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed salesman came from a cute Christmas party, where he was handing out a manufacturer of sports goods sweetness when he was going on for a quarter hour after midnight to the selected Mercedes class C, the new coach of VfB Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-colored bag sponsor.
A man with a brandy skin was allowed to ride a foreign city after him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man too.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or it'll just start.
Words have only been three days engaged by Swiss: "We have reached the eight-finals", namely, the Champions League, due to the win3:1 over the Unirea of Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success: It will be brutally hard to fight the retreat."
"A more important task" stands ahead on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the king's class in the ordinary league.
And to prevent renouncing weaknesses from three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Losing
The 8th Championships League (amendment 16/17. + 23/24 February/ retaliatory match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the turbulent arrival of Babbel will therefore remain preserved.
Not only with an alleged healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart's professionals during a short time of confidence, willingness to wear and enjoy the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths, and I urged them to be braver, explained the Doctor of the Soul Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not demonstrate any effectiveness for therapist Babbel.
He made some magic, he admitted to Babbel's pledger Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedir, who after many weeks of break caused by injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomén" by the literal "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Apparently, it was missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither the players nor managers want to overwhelm the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won even in Glasgow before an ugly awakening came after a defeat at 0:4 in Leverkusen, he considers Khedir.
And the sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was reached in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after the first home win after three months, it was caused by weekend events that were newly experienced in the form of a TV interview with Jens Lehmann's goalkeeper just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are active and not Jens, that put Heldt on the hard-core Lehmann critic.
He introduced the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Even that it was canceled his free day after the matches, he called Lehmann a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statement "forms pure egoism", restored Heldt and announced the consecration for goalkeepers.
Both forty will probably have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they're one of the others that without the work of the team sitting down, it wouldn't be possible to play so hard and fighting.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success", they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Fight the world championship in heavyweight
Your duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson has constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world master Vitali Klikka.
However, after twelve hard rounds, Ukraine was defending its title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Kličko remains the world champion in a box in a heavyweight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat an American Kevin Johnson on Saturday at Bern in a unanimous manner to points (120:10, 120:10, 119:10).
For Klička it is the third successful defense title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukraine was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to the.. which everyone expected.
Klick improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he was defeated due to injury.
Chief Johnson was first defeated in the 24th Battle.
About 17,000 spectators in the Berlin arena drove 2.02 meters high Kličko fighting mainly with their left hand.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Kliček era before duel, but had withdrawn before World Master's strike, so Kličko couldn't strike a decisive blow to his dangerous right.
In total, this was done by passive Johnson at the challenger pretty little, and he was just trying to get into the next lap.
Although he provoked words and gestures, his strikes have rarely hit the world’s masters.
However, it is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Kliček with a full of 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
Ursil Klička as a "resistible zombie" who can't do anything right.
During his respects on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klik's return
The button remained even after its return on October 11, 2008.
After almost a four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin, and took back the WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight before.
In this year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
In this fight I only got one blow, and physically in good shape, I justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream remains, however, the defence of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF organisations.
The WBA belt is carried by British David Haye, after he sat down from the throne of 2.13 feet [2.13 m] high Nikolay Vulajev in November.
Haye denied the fight against Klička in summer, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promotional company is planning a fight against Kličk in London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Chief of the Red Jürgen Trittin faction, due to bad information about Kundúz's defense minister Guttenberg's affair as a liar.
SPD and Line (Levice) invite the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlín - According to the latest insights into the raid on Kundúz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed conscious fraud.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two tankers in September said "knowingly untruth", said the head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday news show "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: Lie.
The killing order was issued in non-respecting the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the report that Mr. Guttenberg had on NATO, said Trittin.
On Friday it turned out that the attack was not only about the destruction of the stolen trucks but of the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
A German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, requested to be killed or injured, according to NATO’s investigation.
Greens, SPD and Line called on Saturday on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately express themselves in front of the Spoken House and also made it clear what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of Afghan Policy for the joint House - and if the Office of Chancellors, Bundeswehr and Intelligence approved this new strategy, they called on Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Künastová.
The spokesperson of the government, Ulrich Wilhelm, certainly refused to criticize.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of Background of the release of Inspector Wolfgang Schneider and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg reported correctly and completely behind the attack on the tankers.
Of course, it was said that they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and silenced the Minister of Sensitive Details.
From the vicinity of the two top officials, however, it was said that they had alerted the Ministry of Defense even to several reports, including the two - page document of Colonel Klein's commanding officer and one report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagzeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in his letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
The Ministry did not comment on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with by the Federal Chamber Investigation Committee, which would be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in the blind state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only to mentally ill or drug-related people combine boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
But who experience dreams in the mind, sees and hears things that others do not see and hear, usually applies in today's Western world to a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the mentally ill or in the drug compound.
Vinu has our imagination: same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, get here and there to ensure that they break the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams of altered consciousness can occur in various forms, in better case we call them vision, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the vision of the mouse Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castenady, the shaman states of blasphemy, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neural transmitters of the brain is derailed - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Comprehensive hallucinations and foolish thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it
The link between delusion and dream was employed by philosophers and doctors since the Ancients.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the false state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, ended in 1861 "the great similarity of defamation with dreams", for Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic figure.
His body is bidimensional and loudly coloured.
Gravity has no power over it, is carried up by the ceiling of the room.
Feels kick.
Follow him with winged Czech figures with blood-red Grimas, priceless teeth.
They hunt him down, dig him with heavy fire shoes, throw him on the wall, feel pain on the whole body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the wall and from the radio.
He can no longer bear the voices he's given and insulted.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, pulls them into a loop and puts it on the hook on the ceiling.
He'll put a speaker on one, and he'll put a loop around his neck.
She's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn to hear the voice of the congregation tearing off the drums, "go to the clinic and get treatment!"
Today henning T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, except for that, he's maniodepressive, he's taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, three years old, he's married.
In the psyche, I have suffered the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is after depression the second most commonly treated disease.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, the most affected can no longer distinguish the inner and outer world, they get into a crowded state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or persecution illusions.
The hearing of the voices is particularly widespread - the voices they order, comment or have dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The affected is unable to distinguish important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter the disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as the dream opens the psyche of a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psyche is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Doctor of the Clinic of General Psychology of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of events, everything is of importance to him.
At the same time, he becomes a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
The schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is not usually possible in them, miracles are a terrible reality, and awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, "it remains a sensory and spatial structure of the reality that man perceives in the psyche, essentially preserved."
Bad thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation occurs within the real framework.
A scientist still stands before a fight, why exactly our brain makes such a monument.
An exceptional condition can lead to short-term loss of relation to reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone's going to develop into a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists come from the fact that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be brain damage, such as the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system is broken, which has not occurred for many years.
Roles also play influences of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if it is a disposition.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain warms up
The crazy thing is that the psychotronist suffers from hallucinations, and in order to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicine, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting ten years of hallucinating and overflow reports, last year, interpreting his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in our head).
The hallucinations include typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly hallucinations under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy man.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of content of ideas that are normally repressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or not repressed; if our brain is closed or missing stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the removal of stimuli, stress, worry about love or other exceptional conditions.
In the newer studies, she gave up to one-third of the reports that at least once in a lifetime there were hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-The First Seas and goes to that gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
It may happen at breaks that she will reach a cologne with long dark hair.
When he answers, the classmates look at her with surprises, no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl thinks of an uptight dream, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, he knows.
He's awake, he can hear and see the boy, just like he can hear and see a girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, he likes that boy.
I'm crazy, he asks sometimes.
But they know that this boy and other delusions are not real and they disappear again.
At night, sounds are more daunting.
Often, they are delusions of stress.
When he sits in class, he can't watch teaching many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears right now represents a new classmate, but he explains everyone else clearly and visibly on the mathematical equation board.
At night, sounds are more daunting.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he cannot often distinguish whether he's awake or if he's asleep, if the images that he sees, the Grims, or the girl with the bleeding cutting wounds on his hands and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at those characters.
My parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Wednesday 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year, and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations settled.
Since psychologist Kasten contacted the Internet, she knows exactly how she's gone mad.
Realms are also art of desperation
If someone's socially isolated, or they're taken away from him, they're likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain has a job enough then, and it's taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., her only child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often played by herself.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she was telling from when she thought herself was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which process also real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for the disabled like Sarah K. to distinguish from each other of the delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "plays in the brain, also the reality shows up there.
Hallucinations are also images that will allow the brain to arise, which is why it works so realisticly."
Also night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ substantially from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unreal.
Therefore, Kasten advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary capacity.
Frontal state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, the imaginary experience is largely pathological in our world, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief of Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, severe illness, but it also brings positives, creativity - delusion is also art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called aniroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even reverse them from the poor state.
Oneiroidal state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full awareness of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by a loss of the world and himself, such as a perpetual, complete inability of movement, replaces a life threatening the real situation of his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality there is no way to handle a situation, there will be a change in the world, but the real situation will become present.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses in some inlerable situation that enables us to have our own ability to form, to switch to loss of consciousness in the moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also, historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzzechsel" (Development of the Heart) as a soul's rescue event.
He was 49 years old when after a heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant, he was aware of his several days’ journey, and his body was lying still on an intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a world that he created, visited other times and places: He stands with an old man tied to bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot is keeping his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between a noble who manufactures slow substances from blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek takes him into his country, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets the Korean mob.
It dives completely into the imaginary happening, everything is real, even later in memories.
These internal paths are fundamentally different for Clausessen from any dream.
A dream is a different condition, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are yet after years and in the insignificant details are clearly clear.
Even clearer and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience is spreading the horizon of our other true experiences, says Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
After all, they show thoseiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug connections, as fragile as they are in the false state, our internal images of external reality.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 they are to take over the publishing of children
The new publisher of Kallen is a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding also has 100 percent for the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long run in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a firm will to enter the business, says SPIEGEL's 69-year-old man.
We handled the details carefully.
The question, if they're also active in the company, is considered afterwards.
And the question is, do they have the skills to do it?
It is not possible to build 7500 employees of their children in forehead unless they are sufficiently capable.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been withdrawing from the Presidency of the Board since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52 years old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors of Burdy since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Deployment has added responsibility for the company's assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera also Direct Marketing, Cizina, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family stand at the head of the publishing house.
The Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "reject 10, 15 years," the Burd said.
Holding should belong 100 percent to the family in the future, says Burd.
In the light of the cases of Schickedenz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses were not sure of the disappearance: "It was always affected by companies who had been infected by the desire for capital, which were speculating and thinking that they could become large players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, says Burd.
I don't see myself as a political president of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.

Escotes viariados
Christmas is coming up, and that's the time when it's appropriate to find out what celebrities wear, and to adapt to it as well as their celebratory wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We're making a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric motor
Endes' energy company, together with Barcelona's councillor, founded 'the Knight of LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and enforcement of an electric vehicle in the capital of Katalánska.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will set out and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, manage, coordinate and submit contributions etc.
The projectMOVELE will also develop, promote electromobiles, gather views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3'Electric Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project for the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
This is the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa’s energy company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and above all energy efficiency.
This is not a single initiative with Endesa's participation in the enforcement of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects e.g.G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the rest seasons in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the country's main export sector, is waiting"restraint period".
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009 Zapatero summed up the measures implemented during the year in support of the automotive sector.
"Without the competition plan for the automotive sector, we would now be faced with a state of desolation, the closure of some of our main production companies", the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to be active in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of peace for this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this sense, he noted that a competitive plan forming part of the IMPA, identified 800 million for projects 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments exceeding 3 billion Eur.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also underlined government aid measures and mentioned the 2000E scheme, which was applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed the average emission level to be reduced by 6% for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a significant increase in the entries, namely by "40 percent in November".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Church of Madrid's Casa de Campo.

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sports style
Mazda intends to show that sparseness to the environment has no negative influence on the sporty style.
This is why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - baptized also as a-Stop-, which is currently available only with a 2.0 150 engine engine.
The second generationMazda3 is characterised by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle execution, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
Front seats incl. driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly qualified.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With the tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, in particular, even more with the Vulcanswagen Golf who all want to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish for a very comfortable ride.
In addition, large luggage space and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is only available with petrol engine for two liters and 150 horsepowers and a self-contained self-contained self-containing transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterised by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desired Mazda3 is in diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometres per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine because it is characterised by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes more serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention primarily the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the creation of a dead angle, control the draw and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, onboard computer with large screen, parking sensors, individual air conditioning, rain sensor and light, bluetooth audio and wheels from 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment wasn't sufficient, this version was equipped with a Premium Pack, with an additional charge of EUR 1.500: adjusted twoxenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not run more kilometres per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which amounts to EUR 21.770 for Luxury and EUR 23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
Mazda3 offers us a lot of satisfaction for this high price every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L. A. has a red carpet, gentle as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only to view the mail, without being able to view certain types of attachments or surf over the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Tim evaluated him as one of the product of the year.
Seeing him out there is harder, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount to be paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is exclusively intended for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanent free data service, for which it is necessary to pay a sixfold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was introduced to the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People already know by smartphone what it means to lose data service after crossing borders or eagerly search for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) to check out the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a doctorate from physics would need to understand them, and also very good glasses, to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so as to be accessible to Europe as a whole, which still does not have a negative effect.
There is a reason for concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such an instrument like FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) will reach this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering downloads books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid upon purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of the FoonPek, it's the possibility of purchasing a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the e-mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it's the best type for the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could also be used on the computer.
The color Michelle loves.
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
In order to take Barack Obama into the position of President of the United States, she chose the dress and coat in this color, the same color also chose to accompany her at the second most important moment of his life: passing the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is similar color - yellow green with sparking effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large height or collar.
At first sight, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Astura Princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
At the opportunity of joining Michelle, she used a large lace, in Oslo male with prints.
They also change the accessories: green shoes with a medium-high slope, a present-like model, but in gold color.
He wears a variety of hairstyles: this time, his hair was dissolved.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger years who are willing to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Peace and working career of Spanish women' performed by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged between 15 and 75 and results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study emphasises that at the beginning of partnership there are many differences in the views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their home work part-time or do not have stable work begin to live with their partner earlier, previously give birth to the first child and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, the partnership and motherhood postpone and have fewer offspring.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of their relationship with their partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who had more of their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the partnership and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although less influence on the start-up period of co-operation with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who deals with research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education is, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
Differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education bore their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with primary education are getting married and giving birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or high education tend to be preferable to obtaining stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child", Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, German actress has become the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I am worth it'.
The author of the 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to another famous figure of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Before it, Evangeline Lilly ('Late') and Freida Pinto ('Milionář z chatrče' entered this selected actress's club.
The pane part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in the Lost).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, the former and the present - met on the annual awards that took place in London, at theRoyal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Ess poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) 30 X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his current life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement, and Vicent does not cover any hives or inspirations.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even during repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of the anti-hosoms, the morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellectual mind, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, no sense, as if it were a blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been preceded by passion for this woman for 13 years, insolence, pleasure and regret, a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odysseau published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-thousand-thousand peaks in the universal literature, which must be overcome by the northern side from which the best climbers are often broken."
About William Faulkner, "He was a weird person.
In his own way, he said about himself that he was heir to a farmer in the county, another time he was a son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge a confused cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running from himself to the future and calling for a quick talk to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "They kneel and pray, 'God my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were carved on his grave: 'After the effort comes a dream, after a storm of calm port, /after war, a rest, /after a full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took depression in his luggage.
My husband totally agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her among the azals, or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos going on to head on Joyce to Baroja?
What else was it about for Beneto to get Baroju to execute Faulkner's gun?
What else was it about Celov to make famous at the expense of the man's glory?"
Depleted aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother was passing through our fourth period, in the Fuenlabrad district, and a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 years passed through the bypass and our dog, a crossword saved from the Vulture of a maximum of six kilograms, without a single word, kicked him twice and badly hurt.
Our soreness is even greater that we don't see anything funny in such an aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a clue.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these people on the walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon possessed by an animal is able to do the same to the woman, to the child, to the old man or to anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, in usually a quiet neighborhood.
The doggy's been crying all day.
Of course, we brought a complaint to the nearest commissioners, but we doubt that there was something wrong with us, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Our bitterness made us announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're having fun suffering from a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where right education has been done, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvil together with the use of helm
Michelin's tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with Spain's Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using helm, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries, where appropriate, and death in the event of an accident when driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of its obligations on transport security, which "means more than to design and produce even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to accomplish this purpose, i.e. by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets while riding on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when more than 500 motorcycles will be deployed to get the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety of "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a producer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures, the patron organisation of Anfac producers and the sellers of Ganvam.
However, the favourable figure is better to put in quarantine as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result of this, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year, not looking at the increase in the last month.
From January95.853 vehicles were sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And neither did the clouds that most harm the demand, although they were bought by private persons, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies and the same in 100% of the cases are financing through third parties.
Further factors such as stopping or continuing the bad economic situation need to be added to the constraints arising from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, aid for purchasing 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention persons operating on the trade list of small and medium-sized enterprises intending to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per km but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Yesterday, they reminded Ganvam of the need to pay particular attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (stones and buses).
The sales team assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the sales calculations for passenger cars and 4x4 decreases by 19%.
The manual braking system is already compulsory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with ESP stability control, hand-held braking systems, all of this will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they already form part of the compulsory equipment of all newly-registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for removing the deficiency is set, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, so that they can help prevent many collisions.
The manual manual system increases the brake pressure in the emergency case, which the system finds out when the driver is going to go down.
But it's not always able to keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study performed by the manufacturer of Bosch's automotive parts, a third of the drivers who have an accident did not climb the brake before the collision and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires maximum braking system, shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more symbolic-than-calculation would prevent one of the four accidents affecting the person-after the introduction of so-called smart braking systems.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system which (helps radar or camera) will capture obstacles and report them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him to increase his pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as intensively as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, the company's employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), will be able to start production of the new Meriva in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as the US manufacturer informed Javier Ortega, that it will need more time to complete the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point in the plan agreed with the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the plants are established, will be issued with a delay in early 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken these days.
No wonder the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US producer to take decisions as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to get Volvo, but he considers the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, who operates under the auspices of the Konverg Russian group.
In the event that no agreement could be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close for the end of the year shall continue to apply unless its sale is made.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
During the development of this magnificent model, engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus weight shows only1.275 kg.
Based on this, in the first place, the automatic download roof is in a screened design with manual control, which reduced weight by 21 kg; the aluminum doors were used, such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning; 13; the reduction of fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of weight by another 7 kg; after fitting the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the lightened 19-inch wheeled dowels of five kilos.
And finally, removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also it is offered with a two-stage PDK transmission, one vehicle tested with a hand-judged six-stage fast closet, mainly on the roadways of the second class in California, on mountain sections with many folds.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the asphalt vehicle is not printed.
On the contrary, we haven't tested such a small and easy model, which at the same time would carry on such safety in turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small atlet capable of heating up muscles during short drive for the necessary time until we have set him up with sprint, braking, and re-use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the driving that is so communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound by will
The sound V6 boxer, 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very hot and can be strengthened by the option 'sport' and by means of a system that modify the sound of the engine that has been previously used with Panama.
The capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether in the suction or repair process.
The suspensions are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asfalt of the roads we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the drive; and in some turns we ran into a light on the impact and brush even in the advanced morning.
In general, this ultralight car is one of the most fun in the market, as it is something more than simply modification Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at EUR 70.831.
'Bag Girl'
My friend Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Cocoon series and occasional 'starlet' at the show 'phirmy', the singer shows his face to a bad girl as he is inferred as his Chanel purse.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basonia has won a victory in Israel
The work treasured a brilliant victory in 82-91 during its hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous withdrawals in the Duska Ivanovice team, and this came to the forehead of its group after the great performance of Miri Teletovice, which with eight triple points was declared the best in cooperation (29 reviews).
Vitoria's team was able to replace Herrmann's significant absence, Olesona, Huertus or Mic's great amount of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the 16-thirds circuit was a great contribution to the final triumph.
The match began with the head for the blue, who were standing on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, which indicated that they had attacked Israel's team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alaska team decided for Barac's inner play and Eliyah's work, which was accepted by sanding and sweaty when returning to its original site to increase the advantage before the break start (34-43).
Teletovic has already become the best in his team with 13 points, although no six's been evaluated by Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided at least, and the macabian wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone was not winning on their playground, and 'Elías' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to returning to the discharge (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, injured, but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to pick up the breath, and then discovered the machineship of Mira Teletovic, which three three times and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaskans have already planted their skin in the last part and in English and San Emetrio (60-75) they have already announced that they will not be allowed to be prepared for the finished results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their manhood, did not surrender and tried to maintain cooperative life from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, with Splitter voted out as a foul sevanov, they didn't catch and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injury makes Uncaja fighting
The union has significantly lost in Greece with Olympics and left him leading Group B in Eurolize in a fight that was marked by three attacks by Uncaja, but above all the internal game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malagy’s companionship has not been watered by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, perhaps one of the most ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter enabled the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three-thirds of each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, to brighten up the court s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although arsenal of locals in the inner game with Bourousis, uncle and Schortsanitis, turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between resistance from USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team started to work and proved its advantage in both zones where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez hit cooperative Unaja
Between internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizasem with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive by Olympics, which, although lost by 19, proved a pretence and could even offset the difference from the match in Malaze Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which was shaking by the lead in the group.
Unaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unaja because of Cook's leadership and triple points and the benefit of Lewis left a certain hope n to win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympics, thanks to strengthening and overloading in centimetres in their zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the acquisition 81-62, minute 37, and Unaja folded and handed over the lead of Olympics.

Tool How much should you take? calculate user payments based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to include a profession, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wishes to work.
During the week that the application works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker was generally "indiscriminately rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit product.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in Great Britain and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 45,226 gross annually and France 31,059, while Spain receives 24.000.
Similarly, the driver pays EUR 34.247 net per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.

The most sought employment on the network for the last three months is the driver, half-time employment and social worker.
Brazil established the date of Zeley's departure
The Brazilian Government set a deadline for the continuation of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucipalpa.
The seat president must leave the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27 January 2010, when his mandate will officially end.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'Affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy to this date, where he has been hiding since 21st September.
"He is aware that on 27 January following the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek other refuge."
The station also quoted a former stateman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline laid down: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the election of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that it would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he tried to save the government of "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented a predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty appeared again on markets, which should not be surprising because it is already a natural condition in an environment where the directors accept decisions on the future, which is uncertain of themselves.
The treatment used by central banks for market stabilising was the payment of debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirect liquidity release at the near zero exchange rate so that financial institutions can purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct acquisitions of assets have already come to an end without questioning their non-natural liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into collages, as the Spanish Central Bank did with their auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of a reduction in risk yields.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences in bonds have regained points, although they are still very remote abnormal levels that have reached the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialise private risks, which were once again affected by public debt.
Once again, they push on quality and US, Japan and Germany have become the refuge of elected investors, increasing the diversification of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision to reduce the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried to reinvigorate the conscience of the people responsible for global economic policy because of the coldening effect of limiting the credit to employment if, in fact, a new day of thanks should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the tribal struggle between the emirals on the renewal of power in emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen earlier.
A government that covers the deficit, the election and the new government coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from the default of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to fail to fulfil their obligations.
However, what has the logic is to force Ecofin to force the Greek Government to transparency and to commit its own citizens to common responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the normalisation period, the premium from transitional risks, after some excess on supported positions, would be expected.
In Spanish, while our differences in public debt are going to increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not need to worry.
If European differences fall and ours continue to expand, it would typically be a Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just an annex. When our leading indicators force most of the services of the studies to override their scenarios of resumption and review their 2011 growth scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, this does not give rise to the great hope for the Spanish economy to meet this warning.
Again, it looks like it's going to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although, for the time being, "sportably, my friend the driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the subcommittee of the House of Parliament, where these days the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasacy, Galán provided several comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50.000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently operating are preserved.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
In fact, Iberdrola believes that, over the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international links
Since 2020, the question has changed and performance needs to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and above all on renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that there is a need for new 18.000 MW, but with other "solid energy".
The Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy law, which the government has just approved, was consistent with the line that the undertaking had demanded, did not want to let live as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the climate change policy.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "reasonable" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
However, Galán considers that the investment decisions, although long-term, must now begin to be adopted because they are ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won the 'commercial' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The company Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport, Switzerland, will play a role as a preferential partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services on ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important ones.
The agreement, which has not yet expired on economic terms, shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castilei-La Mancha and University in Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a centre for the innovation of smart infrastructures
The association foresees investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% are on Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be energy efficiency research in motorways and airports.
Accion is seeking his first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Accion is fighting for his first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where he is already working as a power and water business.
The construction that is concerned is estimated at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 million).
Her rivals are the French business Bouygues and German Hochtief.
The tunnel long 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity for Action to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway undertaking.
The town hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPPs according to the English initiative) for the further development of the project in a business plan categorized by Ernst & Young, administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach USD 1.700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and at the last stage of the competition three companies with significant presence in European constructions.
The transaction group leads Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second based in Italy is one of the largest European specialists on underground construction.
The Accion group is in the game Northern Direct with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last concern, which passed through the MS, is the name LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (the daughter company of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a significant company specialised in the civilian construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large structures and privatisations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering in a way other than the means of acquiring a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger mentioned is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector in addition to Asian references.
ACS gained a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millions assets
Acciones are most important in the geographical area for the sector, where they already have a significant presence through their activities of the energy supplier and in the desalination shop.
In addition to other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) is in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure.
The underground route subject to the toll, whose promoter is the Office for the Infrastructure of Brisbane, called Northern Link (Northern Link), is to connect the western motorway from Toovong with the crossroad route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in length of 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for summer 2010 and launch of work on December next year.
Although this paid pass opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
Tunel started designing in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensand will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief a significant profit because she announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS shall operate through its local Leighton subsidiaries the national network of a wide band with an optical fiber cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet of 400,000 people and will provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project for the King George tower on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction works were only supposed to start and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in building and running two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiaries, received the allocation of a tunnel construction of 2,1 kilometres for a motorway in Slovenia worth EUR 64,5 million.
The company received a contract several days after the work was done to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Rakuska) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to the Sra Agency. Rushmore has informed the railway company for an approximate amount of three million euros each year.
The Treaty contains the possibility of extending by 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected between 16 agencies which presented themselves in the Renfe contest, four of which entered the finale, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra, Rushmore will look after the design and production of campaigns.
The 63 million ProFrance Téléček for braking competition
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France fined EUR 63 million for counter-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has reduced competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and programmes of loyalty to consumers at the edge of regulation.
This sanctions was a former French monopoly and the state company has still purchased more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994, putting obstacles to its competitors.
The commission imposed yesterday was increased by de facto because the Authority, which oversees competition, considers that France Télécom had committed a similar breach as in the past and that it had therefore been reciduous.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened up trade with apps on the Internet in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, Orange's business will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will have to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries as Spain.
Play in the Champions League has since the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since 476,4 million, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The letter runs Manchester United.
The letter runs Manchester United.
It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To that extent, the competition divided EUR 5.362.5 million between 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) which participated since the tournament was established in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out very well of this division.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money he won for participation, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of Europe's unique Cup in 1992 is fifth in classification.
The list is run by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams who in addition billed the most money for participating in the previous Liza Champions.
And yet, she lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country, which has won the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the institution, chaired by Michel Platini, is planning to make 1.090 million for the Champions League.
UEFA has 413.1 million in fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (except another Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who participated received 3,8 million only in their presence, except another EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize premium (80.000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). Osmifalists get three million each; eight quarterfinals 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets 4 million.
Champagne is 9 million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
The club makes at least 7.1 million on fixed payments and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spain is one of the main points and has four assigned places.
The champion from last year gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares with which she wants to get a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not undertake to make a public offer for the acquisition of all securities.
More specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.55025 for shares that would pay in ten years and for which he would pay interest for this delay1% per year.
Sos shares yesterday ended trading at EUR 1.85; therefore Nueva Rumasa’s offer is assessed by 18% under market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the fair value of Sos.
The offer shall be subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group shall provide a period of 15 days to inform shareholders of their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV claimed that it was not informed about the offer, although Ruiz Mateo confirmed that he had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million while Sos capitalisation is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, sauce continues to change its leadership structure.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers to purchase and settle the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazarů, the election of María Luisa Jord as Head of Internal Audit was announced.
This decision makes it the first woman to have a high function in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the President of the Group.
And it is not removed from the field because the business is still submerged in the legal battle of an alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot be punished for the possibility that in the coming months Sos will discover new transfers of funds
As regards Salazar's credit, the former members of the Board of Ildefonso Ortega and Ágel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Uncaja) spoke to the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing the place of their destination.
CNMV allows the option of exclusion of Paterna, which was involved in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised exclusions involving Inversora Mer against Federation Paternin on October 9th.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the standards in force and considers that there is a "reasonable" content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer was aimed at obtaining5500.008 shares of Federica Paternin at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, consisting of 6.142.786 shares taken to trade in exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the offer had been concluded specifying that the price had been established by the Federation of Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents make not only auto-services.
Each is the day thousands of cars who suffered an insurance event were transferred to the service, where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of labour costs can be long and complex.
Calculate manual repair costs between EUR 20.000 and EUR 30,000, including parts and work force, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the estimation of insurance and maintenance events are dedicated to collecting information that manufacturers provide to them in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American Group, is a leading company; 80% of the rating is done with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Veszázquez, commercial director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each provide them with information in a different format.
Moreover, the quantity of data to be processed is increasing since more versions, variants and motor solutions have been reported over the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start to work.
This is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, each model uses "intelligent" graphic processing, where it is possible to "speak" individual parts of the tourist cars.
As for a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the mobile park in circulation, 99% are in circulation.
In order to carry out the work of documenting and drawing up the database, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally experts on mechanics) working with three computer screens at the same time.
Audatex invests €90 million per year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous flow of information enables businesses to use and supply different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but by country-by-country there are also tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating the car’s sales or residual value.
The only undertaking available to the guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers 10 different equipment, while the star product is AudaPlus, a standard solution for the valuation of insurance events intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the varnish shall also include repair time.
This tool shall be valid according to application for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it for a maximum of 10 times a month.
Then every insurance undertaking carrying out thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enable full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came from the assembly line, only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses and AudaSubastas is an open professional service on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with a total insurance event.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models the brands passed through the service due to the accident or how much serious insurance events suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company involved in developing such instruments.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is an Eins group established in 1971 as a supplier of services and a solution for damage assessment, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24.000 users in service, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and charged EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of installation offices in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's resources 62% of her brother is formed in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, including 3,000 in Spain.
Soler Group's global invoice (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company makes EUR 19,1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solara group stood at a market rate of USD 1.000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2.400 million.
Since 2007, she has been anchored on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of heavy vehicles
Last October, Solara bought Autoonline, an Internet base for car and motorcycle sale or special vehicles after insurance events.
The operation was expected to increase EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could spread by 15% in the next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value added services to customers with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sales of spare parts and professional dealers who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1.500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish automotive law, whose chassis number has been eliminated, cannot return to operation, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be permitted to operate, although they have been excluded, after prior proceedings.
Budget service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget only in four steps: vehicle identification, search for a spare part, creating a budget and generating the budget.
Easy to use is a crucial condition for these systems, especially for professionals of a higher age who are more or less resistant to the use of new driving techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 truckes.
Naturally for use, a computer with Internet connection is required.
After identification of the model to be fixed, using the chassis number, there will be a recalculation of the model and then the necessary replacement part will be chosen.
The user can include variables as the cost of labor, surcharge or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between both systems is that it is focused on the service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is EUR 350 per year that the customer can finance.
At present, Audatax is working on making these views three-dimensional.
This is the innovation the mechanics welcome because it allows for example to choose a door and turn it around to display the inner side.
