Strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of necessity to combat electoral fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, calls such fraud a myth with less frequent electoral fraud in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last 10 years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the US.
And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 have declared new laws that impede the process of election or entry into the electoral list.
This phenomenon recorded the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals were submitted for 2011 in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register in the electoral list on the day of the election and withdraw the electoral right of citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state of America required an ID card to be presented on voters.
The first state to implement this request was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have rushed to the enlargement of this process and to other countries.
In the last two years, they have supported proposals of such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens have no universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of America's citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age, allowed to vote, have no photo ID issued by the Government of their State.
Furthermore, there is no identification card of some five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the acquisition of the required ID card often costs over a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected mainly by young people, minority members and low incomes.
25% African-Americans, 15% of people with under $35,000 income; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years therefore do not have the required photo identification card.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their tendency to democratic candidates are not entitled in several states to use their photo ID card displayed by their school.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose rather Republican candidates, cards exposed to these clubs in elections.
By 2004, no State required a citizenship document at the election.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, some twelve states have adopted laws which lay down an obligation for voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It is vital to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
In 2011, Republican legislators supported laws in eight states that disrupted voter registration on the day of election.
In addition, they have limited the right of persons and groups to assist voters who wish to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
During the 2004 general elections, for example, the campaign to register around 10 million people helped to register voters.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 resulted in a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In the next five states, Republican legislators adopted laws aimed at shortening the term for elections in advance.
During the 2008 general elections in Florida, for example, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American voters in this state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, formed only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their support have stood very strongly against the approval of laws that limit the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several pieces of laws in their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even hit them.
They have in part managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states accepted the laws requiring a photo identification card.
However, the newly introduced rules will be completely incomprehensible in 2012 to exercise voting rights.
Democratic critics talk in particular about the prejudice of approved laws and consider them to be an obvious attempt to influence election results in 2012 in key states.
The report by Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the states, where these laws have been approved, represent 171 of 270 votes in the electoral assembly necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to say that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Discontinuation of prostate cancer: to undergo examination or not?
The PSA test was sometimes caused by incorrect results which were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All of this has increased the weightiness of men who have already been so eager to go to the examination at all.
To get tested or not?
We've asked for two experts' opinion.
In studies conducted in the US, a high level of contamination between individual groups has been demonstrated, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and to make a valuable recommendation.
Another study, this time European, contained a difference in mortality among patients who had undergone examinations and those who did not follow them.
This study also demonstrated after a 12-year withdrawal that those who fail to investigate had a higher risk of metastasis by 30 to 40%.
I therefore recommend an examination from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if your relative had prostate cancer.
More dangerous groups are also male African-American origins.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are unfathomable.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his cancer, to offer him alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases more on active supervision of disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not heal because their kind of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them to live.
Rather, we will suggest active supervision and offer treatment in the case of disease progression.
We set criteria that help to decide which kind of treatment and which are not.
However, I recommend that you attend the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether or not an examination is appropriate.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of the principles of healthy lifestyle appears to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moving enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society for Cancer Research.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes hereditary disease.
Also, some percentage remains completely inexplicable.
For Canada's cancer research company remains a priority in combating smoking, although the number of smokers falls.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
That's extremely bad for human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu.
Contributing: 10 years after smoker ceases to smoke, the risk of cancer death is decreasing by half.
Weight
Body and obesity are another risk factor for the disease according to SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, the large intestine and the limbs, the esophagus, the pancreas and the uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," she adds.
Nutrition
It also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to be avoided, for which the same is applicable.
Cleaning meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"It can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," she adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamins supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies are inconsistent.
Although there is a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study is more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulie continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his concerns and precedents from his family with his doctor.
"Profession doesn't mean you have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson caused a legitimate start last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or at least bad explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But there is no 100% certainty between physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto confirm it rather, however, do not yet have all the information so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that this is Higgs' boson, because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what it's actually about.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law whereby two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not attempt too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quant condition" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Furthermore, divides the physics into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find good citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other end, the bosons, the underground anarchists, who appreciate nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (the car is absolutely amazing), which is The Partile Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: the mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the "silver particles", which are spreading great natural forces and with which Higgs' boss is probably related in some way.
However, it is imperative to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals as they might be supposed to be.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "the part of light", which is "a carrier" of electromagnetic power.
When particles with an electric charge accelerates or changes their direction, they "distort" by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble burned into a pond.
From this "disruption" there will be an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon, which is one of the bosons, the "wearers of power".
A more stable field
Also, it's with Higgs' boson, only with the difference that "off" is a different field, Higgs' field to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, just like the frozen levels of the pond, will appear to be a very large pack.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as a speeder in the CERN laboratory - a large hadronic speeder with fine bundles is a circle with a perimeter of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is suitable for us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and Material.
Electromagnetic fields do not react to any particles or any materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others – a piece of paper, for example, will never be held on the refrigerator by itself.
And it is also true that the Higgs field does not respond to all the particles: those that do so have a certain matter, while others (such as photon, let us look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all these research is, "what do they bring?"
From a scientific point of view, this is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any non-compliance between the observations and forecasts of MS.
In addition, the physicists did not literally want them to be able to find, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and cover some gaps in the model.
It is important to note that the model has still enormous shortcomings, does not produce any explanation of gravity (supply!) or dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of space matter (sathe!).
However, the CERN device has not yet revealed such a difference.
Answers
The answers to these research in Mr. and Mrs. Novak's daily life can only be expected very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.
Behold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution that their work would have caused.
They expected scientific use, but nothing else.
Phyzik Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, which created the first permanent laser beam (the front beams were pulsable) in 1962, I already said that - the laser was initially considered such a "play in the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, application may result from any tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle had not planned it at first, now serves as a "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and raised him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but that means you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission for the dignified dying of Quebec recently involved in delicate questions about the rest of his life.
The debate should continue shortly and at the same time a draft law is about to be prepared.
A lot of work remains in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie less than a few weeks ago.
The prostate cancer that fed it provided him with a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven years old," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: a tremendous weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or to eat himself.
He looks out for a tasteful breakfast, and he agrees to help him eat.
He's courageous, and even smiles, talking to unknown people who stop at him, bringing him medication, offering him a bath.
Courage on ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the passage, he dishonors me," he confesses.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors for his drug problem.
"In life, one learns that men are getting fit," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Getting back into the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the man to accept the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people who deal with palliative care, fundamental moments are taken in the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months.
In this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who care about them does not provide them with the so-called "medicine" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "to suffocate in full consciousness."
But I'm sick of discovering my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," he says, and then he chooses to put on her breathing device.
Yet he still enjoys his last visit from Italy to the next day.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body with the help of nutrition is provided.
This seems to be the palliative care that comes in if nothing else can be done anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek, there is a single bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, one can give him a touch of brandy or pepsi, according to his taste.
Diabetes don't have to watch their sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night, they carried Mr. X's beer, who died later last night.
His son will finish his beer this morning to honor his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In Victor-Gadbois' home days go one by one, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 35 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family on pillows, while singing to his honor, a tragically - 36 - year - old man surrounded by his parents, a woman, and two young children after trying all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months there are always three to five beds intended for people with cancer up to 45 years," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients coming to Victor-Gadbois' home come here from their homes, 47% then from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is intended to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois Home and the Company for home palliative treatment of Grand Montréal, are specialized more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And that is what this crucial inability of healthcare in Quebec leads to the fact that many palliative doctors are concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed in circulation by tops in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they support such initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, thequebian health system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that everyone is able to access quality palliative care before they can agree with the euthanasia execution.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency in massive pain without making the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients should not seek death because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologistes care for their patients until the last few months, regardless of the negative forecast.
The hopes of Hélène Richard’s survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my employer that I was done with treatment, she replied that she regretted the fact that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There's no full custody.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when their team of palliative cunts reduced their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Company for home palliative care of Grand Montréal, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which will sleep the patient until the end of the sentence, either at risk or whether the sedatives are administered permanently.
We cannot face that we do not feel this part of suffering.
A patient who does not lose pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
The sick that is not provided with sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to rid me of pain".
The implementation of this report enabled journalists to grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of travel management, businessmen in construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties, and experts on the Italian mob continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which they mix construction, state officials, politicians, trade unions and mafias.
This "bor" came thequebek taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has grown since we have taken essential measures," said the ironically Jacques Duchesneau, the Quebian Member and former chief of police in Montreal.
It broke out in 2011 scandal on the basis of a consistent investigation aimed at embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by Prime Minister Jean Charest by the then liberalquebian Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, transparent financing of parties and the corruption of state officials.
"Even since the start of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Department of Transport saved billions of dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts in check to gain a share of them!
Charbonneau's committee "with two mayors to be demolished," she adds with the hope that she will manage to "break some people's insolence".
Standing unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011
The standing unit for the fight against corruption founded in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, police officers "Marteau satellites", who have since 2009 ensured that the montreal "cartel of money houses" significantly alleviated the inflatation of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, they have conducted a series of tours and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one village in the suburbs.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his duties as mayor of Laval, the third largest quebec town.
He's suspected that he repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for a public contract.
Formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Ms Zambito raised the sensation when the commission explained the "system" procurement mechanism.
He himself devoted over those years 3% of the value of the orders he won in Montréal, to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, for whom Mayor Géral Tremblay was running.
He was murdered after 2000 generous to all parties and devoted more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68 000) to the province parties, but especially to liberals who had been in power at that time.
He also admitted that he was organizing an illegal recovery of finance for the former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money houses whose prices were overpriced
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very clear.
Gilles Surfrenant, former transport engineer, described him very detailed before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from the construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money houses where the prize was awarded.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their remuneration for over 30% to 40% overvalued invoices through false multiples.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of keeping his eyes shut at the same budget that brought dirty money into his office.
On the basis of these discoveries, Tremblay resigned in early November, thereby throwing Montréal into a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Praires district in the east of the island, it has been committed since 2010 to sell the community land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a growing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "he's pulling strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the seam system to stop gangrene and catch up with the culprits."
The process is "inferior but positive".
We are in the phase of the wound cleaning, but it is necessary to establish own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these questionable practices cannot return.
Like when they clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public agents have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of Members informed about this lsti", unless they have gotten wet into these peers!
It's estimated that 70% of the election campaign funding in Québek comes from dirty money, and irony adds: "I heard that it's just a weak waste of reality."
The Quebic government proposes to cut the donations to the parties to $100, but it doesn't say that the situation is going to solve: "Therefore, there is strictly no limit to electoral expenditure, dirty money from politics is not going to go away."
It proposes comprehensive control of the award system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer fall; if we rely courageously on the essence of the matter, we can build again on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has blacked the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, the Duchesneau recommends to all those who mock him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this?
It can be explained by all individuals going into each other or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come to us.
I keep getting next to them every day.
Technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And when you fight, it's easier.
Things are going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in my prognosis at INF Clairefontaine until after my transition to Saint-Etienne, I've always looked up for a degree.
So, you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Actlotti introduced...
The reinforcements of this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me has a bigger taste for the game and he wants to give maximum performance.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same post I did.
And the Andelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
The anceslotti has respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no equal in the first league and one of the best European trainers.
He has enormous experience and has won many titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win another title in Paris.
In January, I attended a calming conversation with him.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In 1st league, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have made it very easy to proceed to the eight finals.
What's your club's target in this contest?
Let's try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of European teams.
We want to first win our qualification group in front of Porta so that we can play the 8th finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's on it.
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and sign up to history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to implement this intention.
And would a great failure not win in the first league as in last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win this year's league title.
Last season we missed a lot.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the chance to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually with 79 points you're clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had even more amazing season.
I think it's gonna work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are seeking the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think PSG media expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect much from us, given what happened here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troys 4:0 at home, and there's still something in the paper that we're reading, it's not very comfortable.
You ask what people might want more from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
We've been able to play in Liz's masters.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought in the second season in eight finals, and they've also invested big amounts!
Given the totals invested, you could expect to have a head start in front of the other 15 points!
That insults the other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which did not succeed last season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we have succeeded in winning.
It seems like PSG was relying on Zlatana Ibrahimovich's performance in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and shows that he's the star of the first league.
Everywhere he went, he showed that he was a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect the player and man.
He also respects the people that he has around him.
What he's achieved is truly exceptional.
This led to others increasing their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representations?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to play too much at this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through this, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also enjoy playing a good game as well.
And that's what I was hoping from my start to represent.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary in our performance.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps headed by the National Team?
He's making results for him.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
Coach picks hard, he's close to players, and he's able to exhale for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc, too.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualified on Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting game?
This fight gave us confidence.
We were all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I did not see such a fight for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
The Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudo), represents both virtual money (but portable to Dollars, Euros...), as well as a secured transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
With 15 000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a payment agent.
The bitcoin course first reached the maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it is going at the threshold of about ten dollars (the review of the courses is shown on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, it's not impressive.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money", "competive dollar and the euro" and "defence of ordinary money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the action in a video game that man gains by game or can buy (and even replace).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority shall check and process individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the depository are the books of the current accounts, the controllers, the issuers of money and the buyers and the sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in fact between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by the encryption system with a double key.
Thus, the network may verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that substituted bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts distributed across the network.
The key phase lies in writing this new transaction into this book.
It is by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers addressed by a temporary central bank, it will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the phase of file cutting; i.e. the conversion of a huge file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they'll "cut it apart".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print ( exactly zero in the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructible to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to the print.
If the user wanted to pay twice the same money very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of both transactions - the second one will be abandoned because each has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is shared on a regular basis by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by a total of 21 million, but it can be divided up to 100 million, so the margin area is...
The difficulty of the task also increases with an increasing level of calculation.
The net has already experienced its rise and declines.
The website that provides services to Bitcoin has been attacked and the stored bitcoins have been removed.
"The usedculine does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded the Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of washing dirty money thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not go.
In November, "Obry Discounts" were launched.
"It has been replaced by $300,000," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinbul, who deals with the transformation of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to the credit card (with real money) or without contact by phone, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions which make it cheaper.
In addition, the carrier corrects its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up with traders where it is not necessary to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address you can "photograph and recognize" by phone, explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
"It's still going to take a while before Bitcoin becomes established, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB in its report foresees a re-evaluation of the different risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and make the Afghans choose their own future and wait for everything from us.
The greatest harm has been suffered by people in the Afghan countryside that we have punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And so did we, for we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the injuries and the mutilation.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often they are rurals who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, although jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tajik.
Now they are experiencing tolerances and often the help of local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French forces from the base of Nijrab, which I followed from the peaks of the mountain planted with almonds thanks to the French loans, took place in order.
The wagons and armored vehicles are on their way to Kabul without assault during the air escort of the helicopter.
From the end of 2014, Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable procedure in 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was then empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the struggle between the various resistance groups.
Their takeover over the country was then considered to be its kind of exemption, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these rural people, which fully controlled Al-Ka'ida, but their situation did not improve until now.
Some mujahedins, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, they strengthened the state land which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were never in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
A number of youths want to leave as they leave, those who have been able to use American generosity: capital relief is considerable.
Young people are already tired of war and ideology related to it.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was recognized and its advantages were taken into account.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; currently 5 million people live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given a job, they will no longer want to return to the triumph of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, like mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will stand in her forehead be legitimate?
Some of the Soviet military commanders are already reinvigorating province militias that will be central power beyond control.
Afghanistan, a horny country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation following the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so that the post of the Prime Minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has managed to recover, no dam works, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
The priority has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And it just brought the feeling that the western states were here just to get hold of it.
Without energy for the processing of iron ores or coppers on the ground and without means of transporting raw materials over the mountains, however, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the mine on the Mes Aynak copper and left international archaeological teams (for World Bank support) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, will also need to renew normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girl and boy lycea, French cathedrals at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegates.
Since 2009, the initiative "to get a heart and soul" has been working for an easy task to align assistance and military activities, in which the service "civil-Armad steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) was working, which was abolished in 2012, but has resulted in countless French non-governmental organization of success in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages.
These work, involving many local workers, helped to reduce the rebellion: watering, wells, drinking water, wooding, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of cultivable areas.
What memories do we leave behind two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for fine agricultural aid from the local community in the Kapis Province.
In order for these farmers to free themselves from the rebellion conducted by foreign groups, they wish, according to their own words, to achieve slight civil aid for their benefit, which would have been properly controlled and touched directly by them.
The difficult work at the Egyptian Institute
President Muhammad Mursi set off for the next poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the declaration of a constitution which temporarily confers unlimited powers on him, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text.
Before less than a week, she gave the state head of this assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text that has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal guesses.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's dissatisfaction.
From the perspective of the opposition, the President persists in his 'autocratic deliria', continues to 'distort his word' and 'the law'.
However, its supporters ensure that it is a means to engage with a constitutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short time section, which forces Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to re-introduce national and democratic legitimacy, while all countries reject protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially because this successfully organised vote builds the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will praise my text, or I will retain unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere 85 Members of the Revised Constitutional Assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists yesterday.
Most liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the Constitution was announced, they banged the door with no chance to make their views known.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have taken a step forward.
In order to achieve persuasion, 11 people from a range of alternates were successfully added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It does not surprise that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further suspended the fact that one of the few disputes took place that day around... hours of prayer when some members of the committee were given the opinion that hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text that was voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that 'the Sharia rights principles are the main source of law'.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term 'basic' with the term 'general', which would allow more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been repaired represents the mark of their good will and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"Policy," the liberals say, who only sees a rhetorical problem in it.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with the advisory role of, in particular, on the issues of compliance checks with the law of the Sharia.
According to an expert in Egypt, Sophie Pommier is disturbing because "the people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Theocracy can be seen in this."
The fear of liberals is even more debilitating the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the present one.
"For the time being, there has been no specific religious consequence.
Egypt remains a framework civil state with this constitution.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not narrow but university workers, many of whom have studied in French schools," a mild fear of Alexis Bluet, who is preparing work on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be a distinction regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, the reference to "fiqh" [Islamian legal science, reference red.].
And in the future, the question may arise of the extent to which civilian judges are competent to comment on this."
Yesterday, the text approved is very criticized in addition to the religious pages because of the extended powers conferred by the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on the former regime.
Other disputed place: powers entrusted to the army.
In line with the wishes of the military representatives, the Parliament's budget will not be verified, but the National Defence Council.
In addition, in military courts, civil proceedings will not be prohibited as required by the Human Rights Protection Association.
These associations speak in relation to the text which they believe is directed against freedom, their doubts.
The punishable act of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with protecting women, emphasises Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to her, she is the only positive point in the torture ban referred to in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to perform a television speech last night, manifestations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The state heads will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, buds of the world and sea from saturated salt solution.
The promised earth combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the untappedness of nature.
AaF identified five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to holy places
To visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
They claim that God’s mercy will come upon all those who enter this bath.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus’ miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the net.
Here also Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the path of pain, or Jesus ’ Cross by way of the Latin Via Doloros.
It starts at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where a court took place, passed through the streets of Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotta - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointed and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian bud of the world that symbolizes salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was grown, from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - Wall of screams, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there are people of different creeds leaving notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a road through the vertical
The ruins of the Masada Fortres remained from the secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herodes the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the sea level.
Only those who deal with climbing can get to it by their own forces.
The others to this historic mountain will take the cableway.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists have managed from the foothills of a pendulum bus.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, there were reportedly at the top of the mountain of pagan gods.
Visit Unique Museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one way.
But at least five of them, the most interesting one, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parliament).
There are ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of Judah's desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exhibition they are widely represented by Impresionists and Expressists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which visitors represent several rooms of ancient Turkish spa with figures of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarai it is worth visiting a unique private museum of Ralli where you can admire the statues of Dalího and Rodena.
There are no guides or detours with souvenirs.
The entrance is free and the gifts reject strictly.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter in - and you'll be found in absolute darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also revealed.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, surprises, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bath even in the winter months, because the temperature of the water in it does not decrease below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people have been bathing in it for a whole year.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most strange sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at level 417 m below sea level.
The azure water inside it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface and those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistic.
You come here to treat yourself with salty water - solanacea, and a medicinal swamp that can treat your health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, trachea inflammation, diabetes, to cure your suffering nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Despite them, there was a famous sea path connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
There are mentions of this city in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it is a place where Noah built his Ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then lived together a long and happy life.
Indeed, tourists love tows with narrow streets named after signs of perseverance.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
You may meet newlyweds in Jaffa who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their pictures taken.
And in Caesarai - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pilate Pontský.
The carefully refurbished theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not need to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the Russian population.
It is better to take money with you, not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for checkers (this is about $1.8 of a check).
The city transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper.
It's basically an underground rope track.
Travelling all types of public transport costs 6 keels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, he ceases to work in tritzes, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning, work week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels you can only get a food basket: except for pork, seafood, fish without ham and meals, in which there are a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge lobster, various kinds of sauces, groundballs - palfel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Then there are very many fed cats who play "toulise according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Premature cats love populated places, and with taste they go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day according to the car brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 checkers a day.
Tickets to museums cost on average 30 checkels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most US, Russian, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to meet the country and relax.
The country was promised to visit 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than during the same period in 2010, before the visa was repealed on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" reports to Moscow: emigrants save money on their tongue
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still discussing the bill of compulsory language trials, there have already been frauds in the country selling "storaged" certificates
In Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers come annually.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which each migrant worker will be required to pass the test from knowledge of Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and of the fundamentals of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Even people who have successfully obtained a certificate and obtained an academic diploma for the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to this law.
Prosecution, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of tests will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Department of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was supported by Member States' pride and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders could ask many times in the press: what does it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and the visitors themselves?
In particular, representatives of migration services will be responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from "slave work."
Today, many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explaining the chairman of the board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to resolve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in emigrants without profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrants are sentenced to conflicts with unfair people who will help him under the pretext ensure that the "image" is in a terrible, tight place in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, spend months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country they promise them one thing, but after their arrival they will cheat their passports, they will not pay their promised wages," confirms the head of the main tourist administration of MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't load it!
The less so that many Central Asian people who intend to work in Russia recognise that they do not not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but have no experience even with the work.
Of course, this is not even their fault, as a rather bad thing: only very few Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajik can afford at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that there is a need to dress properly, both and equip for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must be paid for their work on the first occasion.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
It is true that, with regard to the law on language trials, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out in those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams, they won't get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to be in Russia.
"Welcome, or You Couldn't Allowed Entry."
Many of the incoming workers claim to gain official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
But a false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police staff know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two cigarettes, tea," shared with the journalists about his experience by the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuskadamov.
"Come on, don't be a vamp, buy a painting"
On the first day of application of the Language Act, it was found that false documents were not only documents of migrants for registration.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of language examination.
The falsified documents are printed on ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners have not gotten to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in hope of making it easier for themselves to pass tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times higher than passing an official test: it's going to be a migration worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, that is, the government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed to test for the first time, the necessary time to attend a course of Russian language bases.
For visitors who do not have Russian, work is envisaged in areas where there is no need for active action with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take into circulation the illegal market for weapons
The share of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia presents a proposal for tightening the law in relation to civil weapons owners.
It is the reaction of government to recent events: the initiative was the shootings at weddings that were unscrupulous, and the massacre prepared by Moscow’s attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in seven people killed.
Police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which they can obtain a licence for carrying weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the Committee on Security and Combating Corruption of Irina Jaroja, which promised that changes to the arms law will be submitted to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem of drawing screws.
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - demand the refusal of "inadvertent tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared by Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminalist in an interview with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months 2012 using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of an open letter are convinced, the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not require perpetrators to move to the 'black' market.
According to their words, currently any low-price weapon can be found in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The black arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baraniec, who worked ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages accepted by weapons orders
First of them - 'Arm or military road', that means a weapon that was stolen during the battles of the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by Russian officers and bailed himself," says the Lamb.
The other type of 'black weapons' are weapons stolen by criminals at security forces.
Baranec explains that theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement.
Illegal "mainly" is being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proved that some fires were established intentionally - to cover up a mana," said the former soldier.
According to Barance, both arms manufacturers and arms manufacturers bring their contribution.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market, and they eliminate weapons that deliver on the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in the paint industry, and there was a mafia that organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the 'black' market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Designing Public Administration.
Specialists discussed the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office's statements, criminal literature and public data portals focused on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, list researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all the weapons have been found on the black market, "a small number of officials whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the armed conflict weapons came in 14% of cases of arms theft in their production, 5% of which is "black archeology".
The consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to give his name is convinced that the weapons found in the exterminations by black "archeologists" no longer buys - are just too old.
Most often, he says, the seller drives for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
In spite of the battalion, the interested party will buy a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun with him, and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there in EUR 900 per piece with two storage tanks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and that is why whenever they begin to burn their plan in clarification of criminal offences, they will carry out a control purchase with traders with illegal weapons," he adds advisers.
"As in a fancy store"
The seller and buyer are most often found among each other through their known ones.
I visited websites and blogs until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Expert" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to a "cut," where we will act together.
The most important thing I've learned is up there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraniec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells the salesman - a counselor. - I have such a friend, but I don't trust him completely.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivan Ivanovich who asked me to tell my daughter that he had fallen tooth."
And now I'm gonna get through the person I'm sure of.
He'll give them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it to him.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraniec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the stand to publish on this subject.
The scheme did not change according to his word.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "everything you thought it was."
"I felt like I was in a fancy shop," he recalls a soldier.
Buyer, according to the word of the Lamb, does not offer hare in bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the seller into the woods and we're building a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I convince myself that the gun shoots well, we start to act," describes the method of the tag.
Tray on the sofa
You will be brought to web sites and groups on "Vkontakt" where you are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There are no documents or personal meetings needed to do this.
"It takes a set amount of money," writes in the advertisement title on the website "Buy a fight gun or a vending machine".
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to the underagers?
"Of course without a license," the user "Ivan" (the letter is kept).
"I buy TT.Moscow" briefly formulate the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently decided a huge network of sketched websites and persons who wish to buy a military weapon can bury with a shovel.
People go hungry like hungry fish on bait, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraniec
I have heard of such schemes: the parties are usually registered outside the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranowiec confirms that you can stay unarmed after entering your orders on the website and find yourself behind bars.

100 bucks Makarov.
When buying illegal firearms you will pay according to the estimate of experts usually the amount of between $100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislova of the non-governmental organization, "right of gun" you will get Makarov's gun for 100 to $300.
You have to wait for one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from storage warehouses for long-term storage through medium-term storage.
According to the official statistical office, the total number of these offences in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the January - October 2011 period, and amounted to 22.9%, and the number of cases clarified by theft and blackmail, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood workers and supermarkets strike
"McDonald" works will go through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last few days, the wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets Walmart and in the restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a 9th wave, or whether it is about to disappear soon.
The whole event is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing modest salaries, which receive numerous staff in Walmart and in fast food systems, the aim of the protest organizers to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is practically intact by the professional movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called 'black Friday', when cheap sales orgys hit America, the population was seized, and in some cases they were accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, in which they work around the world on 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade chain trade chain trade unions and left-wing activists, the goods of which are intended for the people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low wage employees in Walmart stores buy only at work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because few are paying his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand scanners.
The "black Friday" demonstrators demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee gets $1.5 an hour, but that doesn't match expenditure, they say employees.
The researchers at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, the company will cost $3.2 billion a year.
On average, it is 1.1% more than it is spent on wages now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully on consumer shoulders, each visit in the shop will be only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s advocates point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and that companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 hours on Thursday to midnight on the following day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
Overall, its cash register was made on "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of Dan Fogelman stated in an interview for left-wing website of Huffington Post that jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all over the "other media sensations" organized by the union.
"Unloaded treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not trading houses Walmart (these in this progress city are not too popular, and therefore they are almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jean-Claude Juncker, member of the City Council of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work is in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average, they receive their rank workers in New York $8.90 per hour.
There's no lower wage in this expensive town.
I don't really understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The work at "McDonald" will be carried out by almost a quarter of American teenagers working behind a pool after school for part-time and living with their parents.
Few people in this see their main source of nutrition or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I am constantly meeting in an interview with "McDonal" staff who complain that they must live from this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there's a comment from the author that says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cash and chefs start receiving at least $15 per hour in the underries, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast food sector.
American laws prohibit the administration of the establishment of trade unions and punish activists of the trade union movement by bullying and release.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier.
However, it is difficult to introduce a trade union organisation in the enterprises of rapid refreshment for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is an unusually high labour fluctuation.
I disagree.
On this day, loud protests were also held in many other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at the midday meeting at the "McDonalda" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians came out, especially a member of the City Council of Youngie Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your fair work!"
The Democrats also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to move together to support fastfood workers to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As New York Times described it, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But only a few hundred people attended it, although nearly all of them were employees of fast refreshments, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark, which ingests the flame of mass movement, is yet unclear.
"In the meantime, the brain is deceiving on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of extended reality; in recent times it means to sense the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news and it was announced in November that Microsoft also submitted a request for the relevant patent.
With an interview with a leading group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that for scientists of this company glasses are already in the past.
Love is the perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public space.
Please tell us the framework what your research group is dealing with?
We are dealing with the interaction of man with the machines, but at the same time we are trying to shift the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in a stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, and most of all, it touches the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years forward and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is today for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all it is a very interesting option for driving through gestures.
- What else will happen to us in the future?
- No matter how Kinect transmitted interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly low.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it doesn't underestimate itself?
- He can't be regarded as anything - there's a question of privacy, because we don't always want to inform others about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with the computer are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not the laughing ones, just the short ones.
The gesture would not fall asleep with the camera of the device, but the bracelet that would track the motions of the bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemonade can?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at a given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can better identify human reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, that is very important.
If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or anything else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can reflect on our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixel alone, it's like math and depth.
In view of the matter at present, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to designers of algorithms.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolutions in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of images per second is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are quite frankly little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, while current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
For me at work, he would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, but I don't need so much touch, but I need some images in one second extra.
- And increasing the number of cameras isn't necessary?
- There are now three "kamers" used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is the receiver of the missed signal.
And now the third camera - that's actually the common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depths of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature positioning of the cameras and see how it helps to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that the daily exploitation of the technology of extended reality with special glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatchphones in reared hands is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be "transferable" like the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from the cloud platform at any time from the glasses to the smartphone, projection screen and further around.
Bryle - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem which critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that extended reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of the tangible impressions might possibly become an eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain kind of background for displaying.
Excellent recordings of compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the tangibleity to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at the defined point where your finger is located, causes a tangible feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blowing on your toes.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve ending in your fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain yet?
To think he feels what it seems like to feel at a given time when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here there is another challenge, which will be fought for even longer - how to bring a man who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country routes (in fact not such as clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If deceiving the brain becomes the target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in simple beginnings.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
The "Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "Petrohrad Avantgarda" project dedicated to the citizens who are at the head of the project are the Avantgard of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant characters of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements exceed the city framework, often find recognition in Europe without having reached the universal glory.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is an amazing artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian museum, here at Summer Gardens, the fashionable pubs, and the vernistries.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical petrohradian copycats, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - that's the brilliant man of the petrohrad avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city person, its appearance on the streets raises a smile on people's faces, increases everyone's mood.
Recently, he took the fingernet and became a petrohrad flašnetist, because he matured all his divine life, philosophy, and image into this difficult role.
Cyril, why do you go all the way through town in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoises?
- I chose a red color as a designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is just a little different from gray, is building aggression and waking up bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to discuss.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky where my work was exposed.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, there was a wave of old free unofficial artists and new, free types of artists I could not understand.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, with post-gasonian artists who brought us to Pushkinski 10, and there were no more waves.
It appeals to me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
And all of this has been merged in your art-lining ...- For me it was important to be found in the center of the culture of Peštěburk, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I settled the post on Puškinska 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of peštěburk bohemy before the reconstruction.
There were many births:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Šnur and his friends sang under the glass of light songs, dressed in urgent tricks, in the middle among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is in style now.
When the band started playing live, it became "Lingerrad".
Trachtenberg has run many programmes of halli-Gallivian times.
We gave them Trachtínberg, which started his great career, his basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Grisbodedov - that's a copy of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and permanent guests left.
I am the hero of the last century when culture meant something else.
In 2000 a survey was organised in print, a special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination of the "Umělec of the Year" I was appointed myself, thus ending my peak.
In new times according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctively identifiable.
Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which actuality and permeability are caught alive.
I'm going to have a programme show called the Russian Museum of Clowns.
The clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be social, being so painful and terrible today.
But in clowns, everything's on fire, there's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of a totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today people meet by clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on an inner person.
Or maybe he can't give up his hand and he needs to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- The cultural city should have been such a hero.
And who should be if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactive, sweet.
Culture is falling apart.
In the past, people used to meet in the hymns, the gods loved one, simple other people.
Today everything's broken down into micro-companies, it's very hard to make everyone happy.
I'm not a hundred-year-old note to like everyone.
You need to think about who you're gonna like today.
Today every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand viewers come to Stas Michail!
- He's got fans, and there's a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to cultural land, and 10,000 won't come, and as a result is less management, money, everything's gone.
I have fans, the main is that no one will fool them, and they won't interrupt what's been experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end.
People are often confused today.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I am a man of culture last day, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing images.
And I'm for a culture like this.
Cyril, what's missing in Pešperburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an activist through culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was not in all, but they understood that there was a need to support true experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are stuck in a corner, because there are great experts who appreciate these experts right and guide them to the right path.
Today, the taste is prosperous.
The same Erart, but different from the fact that they sincerely say that not all modern arts are accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peměrburk is?
- Peštěburk - it is not the capital city of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And the art is poor at our deterioration.
We need cultural land, but today there are writers more than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many visitors in Europe who like to go to exhibitions and concerts.
There's only a weak layer with us.
We need art to become fashionable as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the grant of St.Peštěburk
To Family in Space
The Earth is at risk.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space corset caravans with Earthmen on board are issued on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of effortlessness or a replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be developed even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a highly built scientific worker of the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Shernberg (SAIŠ).
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, Venus' surface reaches 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there in great height or orbit of Venus... in space.
Questions of reproduction in the universe began scientists with flora.
The experiments on plants have been carried out half a century ago.
Four generations of peas produced on the orbit do not differ from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was removed on orbit - very small fruit flies of Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the universe to see how an embryo develops in a state of troublelessness.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the exit.
But then the problems begin.
"An important problem with the fact that this bird must find resistance, must stand on his own feet and begin to move," says the head of the Institute of Biomedicine Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they can't find the resistance, the chaotic birds are falling and making cocksuckers.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds came to an absolute disappearance of instincts.
Birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the difficulty was that they simply perished in four days.
"We had the birds hatched twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in Vladimir Sicev.
The last "minirch" with the animals flew on a orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatell "Bion" but they will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were broadcast to space already pregnant.
In fact, they didn't show anything supernatural in there.
"It was only on bio-satelics, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be done," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the progeny was born to cosmic pots.
However, it is not possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot implement their sexual instincts when losing their normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened the Creškovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Teayka flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if she would last the flight to space.
Whether she can give birth after that flight.
"Although no one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vachnage the veteran of the rocket-warming industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after flight to space, she gave birth to Valentine's daughter's first wife-in-law Cáreškov's daughter.
The father of the child was also an astronaut of Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female-communaut of the Light Savice, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born after years and have grown to be healthy by offspring.
"It may even be dangerous during orbital years," says the cosmonaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Rusk Valeri Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaborator CPK is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
In this context, under the conditions of zero attraction the cosmonauts are developing the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water imitates the state of troublelessness.
For adults, though water is comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for young children it is natural to live.
Small Nithians seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother’s water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, it will only last for 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenov.
In short - if there is no natural situation for the newborn baby, then women are more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of troublelessness, abdominal muscles, upper muscles, the ability of the body to release the fruit occurs very quickly.
We can keep that aside if muscle stimulators work during birth.
After all, it is possible for birth to take place in a special chamber where the mother’s organism causes fruit.
"And what else?" asks Valeri Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not act as a natural attraction, it cannot properly shape the structure or system of muscles.
Newborns on orbit can't wear like an adult in a special suit with a load he could train in.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs to develop unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring on Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted here," says the Head of the Committee for Bioethics IBMPRAN Igor Pestov.
So spreading children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But one day, there will be a time when the earthmen will become a reality, and when they will appear in their coronations on a far planet that will become home to their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the SAO: Control of the quartz system failed by the blame of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controls and quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it is also speculative in its application.
In an interview for News.cz, Vice President of Miloslav Kala's Supreme Control Office says.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - this is what I think is missing in my opinion," explains Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions suggest a joint inspection of Czech and German auditors.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nečas’s approach to the so-called "breeding system".
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with his controls - is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be somehow set aside, and if it forbids anything, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the Office from acting under obligation to control and enforce its duties," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, under which legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel inspection that we started about two years ago.
It is simply the case that European legislation regulates how public procurement is dealt with by individual national legislations and then also practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the inspection is not yet completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is possible for us also "a more stringent and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create further and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pay attention to the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, anyway, to help you, what is coming from it for you?
Such joint control could contribute to avoiding efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Sociality means getting the right thing for reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to rule out enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But by reducing our contract limit, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system is going to smother itself with a lot of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they're going to draw a lot easier than if the limit stays higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the introduction of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, as well as the SAO there works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized just like us, also has a college, is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities act in a similar way.
The powers are also similar to that of a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, these accounting courts have also at the level of individual federal countries - this is how the system differs from ours a little.
BRH can only control the federal money that we have presented with state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Accounting Courts.
What's more legal than that, it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is called a role model, but it certainly cannot be said to be better at all.
Is it even necessary that they have better controllers?
I certainly don't, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even countries that we regard as a pattern are dealing with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what has the amendment to the Act on Public Contracts been showing already its impact?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, we are not yet in the follow-up.
Because we do ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We are looking at this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new "risk detection of fraud" tool, through which we have driven nearly 14 000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there will clearly be changes, because the limits, the conditions of certain types of selection proceedings will change and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law more to be a benefit or another burden on the red tape system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it confirms it.
The problem that may arise here is that it will not be able to comply with the rules of "stricken" and will not be possible.
For the purposes of the previous rules, audited persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that each non-compliance with the Act on Public Contracts constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must rule out those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal doubt that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will cause only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's see where the road can't go.
The Prime Minister has recently said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "stress system" - and what does that mean?
Is the scorp system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be somehow set aside, and if it forbids anything, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the Office from acting under obligation to control and enforce its duties.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're gonna do anything.
In the Act on Public Contracts, there are rather strict rules on how to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing in my opinion.
Roads are frozen but mostly mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, cars are mobile, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovar region, roads were roadside this morning, but places were frozen and also snowed.
Temperature has declined between five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is expected to warm slightly.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Krušné horách, however, there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
Seats were also less visible due to fog, results from data from the dispatch of regional roadmen.
The R6 and first class communication are now mobile in the region without limitations.
But care is on the spot, for example, in some bridges, where the surface can be soft and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
However, there are still remains of frozen snow on them in some sections.
Particular attention should be paid to driving in higher positions.
Pardubický and Kráhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Bohemia, there is a risk of confusion, in higher areas and in the mountains there may be a high layer of snow on the roads, and it will inform its site Road Directorate and motorways.
The motorists warn the driver of the attack, it can be formed mainly in the higher positions of the Pardubic region.
The water can be in the vicinity of Lanškroon, Ústí nad Orlicí, Police, Svitav or High Mostage, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicalally, the roads I/43 and I/34 are treated at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer used is in the highest locations on roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžna and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemias today is most often clear to semi-free of precipitation.
Temperatures tend to be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing down weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in Plzeň region are mobile this morning, but places with increased caution and driving must be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperatures move between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communication may be frozen.
The seats must be counted even with fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
It's coming out of the information dispatch of the regional roadmen.
The D5 motorways are almost unlimited, but with greater caution, they recommend communication administrators between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most roads in the first class have a dry and frozen surface.
However, in southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, the sections may be sharp.
The communication of the second and third classes is wet and in this case alerts to frozen sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc Region
With snow cough on the road, drivers must be counted today to the highest levels of Olomouc Region.
After the chemical spray, she stayed on the Red Mountain saddle even on her way in the direction of the Videl Cross.
Roaders drove into the field at night snowing, in Šumpersk according to road administrators about three centimetres.
In the other parts of the country, vehicles are mostly mobile without restrictions.
"On Šumpersk there lies the highest remains of snow.
With snow coughing on the Red Horsky saddle, drivers must count in direction on the Jeseník," said today ČTK the dispatch of the Šumper Road Administration.
In the field of the night, they also set out their colleagues in Jesenick, the ways to and the highest positions are now, according to them, after the chemical treatment of the naked and wet.
There are roadways on Olomouc without restrictions, but drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Ustecky region, Liberec region
Just a few difficult places are reported today after the roadman's wound in the north of Bohemia.
Besides several places with snow or fridge, mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice are closed from the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications are not yet reported.
The presence of refrigerators is reported mainly from the vicinity of Štětětě.
According to her meteorologists, at night the perfect conditions were clear and freezing during the rain day and the melting snow.
The main moves are reported adverse conditions even on the road I/13 on the border of Ústeecký and Liberec region.
The container from Telnice on Knínice forced the bent branch of the trees, which moved under the snow, to the roadway.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is the end of the world for less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tappa, we're making fun of this and we're saying that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to put the end of the world away or prevent it.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar ending announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
A day earlier on 20 December, 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place simultaneously from 21 hours.
They will end approximately at a time when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone about 12 hours before us, the Mayan calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we invented everything together with our artist, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think about the state in which we will once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we also created a unique collection of boot, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tappa group, along with other interpretations, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World terminated".
Has she been very popular with YouTube today, will she also sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and that's in complete conclusion, if we can do it, and the end of the world will never happen...
It is accompanied by all the interpreters at all three concerts at the same time.
Hymny will suddenly also be connected in a unique direct transmission on Czech TV.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip played by Tomáš Hanák, and in it Xindl X...
How did you get them to cooperate?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize lots of fundraising events and concerts...
We try to engage them in these projects intensively.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?
For equipment of the barrierless study center, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with Tap civil association in Jedliček Institute.
Students from the Jedliček Institute regularly receive teachers and attend the activities they enjoy and care about.
The students alone do not have the means to go on their own, so we try to allow them this way.
In the context of the construction of the Jedličkov Institute in the future, a separate building will be created to which we will move with this project.
There are several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We were trying to set up a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dane Bárta, The Tappa, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombical action" for the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time on Prague Spring, so we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech National House in New York City, and I personally, when we're in the US, would like to connect it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimal, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tappa is a group that creates hendikepated people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric cart, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we carry with us a large amount of cargo and a box with instruments...
However, in the meantime, it has always worked out without problems, the ČSA and the British Airways have been greatly prepared for us that I have been wondering how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without a problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in colorlessness, public access to hendikepated and similar.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just seen in Russia that everything is still in complete beginnings in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here is still unusual for a person on the electric cart to move alone in the city center.
There's no such thing as wheelchairs on the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that seek to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, how do we still have to catch up to the country?
There are a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with heavy hendikep move independently in public can go to toilet, museum, anywhere...
But it's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, so we're a little ahead with The Tappa!
Respect for the public or the integrity of the matter is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things are going to change for real.
So far, there are rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tappa Kapela is currently very popular, but what made you base it for a few years back in 1998?
I joined as an educator at the Jedliček Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm myself a musician, I'm playing saxophone, so I started a party music ring with my colleague.
And over time, as our moderator Lád Angelovich calls us, he's a little out of hand.
But the popularity has come in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting to famous singers and also actively working to promote the band.
We figured out that a job that wasn't seen, basically as if it wasn't there.
Moreover, thanks to our contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal of getting it up with The Tappa this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical, all new ones are taken with care, and it takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very little, but I dare say that Tappa is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But this regret is absolutely useless because people with hendikep are not suffering from any abandoned being we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a hendikep, it's not just for them to move, it's for the whole company.
Has this success also helped by being a strict boss, how many people have described you?
If we want to do good work, we have to be uncompromise in many things and require some discipline.
But that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm will leave them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and which wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tappa band has 20 members.
How many were in her early 1998?
Only the only Lád Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, and that's impossible.
Who has the will and taste has always the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20 December from 21:00
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédě and Ostrava Plynoje with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities in the end of the evening connect by telemost in a joint singing band The Tap Tap "The End of the World canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment of the multi-functional STUDEO education centre at the Jedliček Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
Access to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free tickets in pre-sale by Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week Poland was accepted as the second country of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became the full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland launched close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of projects of the Agency during the subsequent years.
However, the trip of Poland to space began much earlier.
The years into space were devoted to Polish enthusiasts before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Šternfeld in Warsaw, astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 represented ideas from pioneering work Enter into cosmonautics.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cool and, after years, he remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Shernfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha Award for entry into space in France in 1934.
Later, Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous astronaut and his contribution was appreciated by one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon named his name.
In 1925 a railway road was built in Poland, which was supposed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and neither are we aware of the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the take-off of the track or to its sounding.
Information about this drug is only known from the daily press.
Since 1933, rocket missiles began to capture the Polish artillery.
The research provided the Military Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycig.
From the materials kept, it is clear that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, research has been interrupted by the arrival of the German troops.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric fighter rocket designed by the Rohoziński engineer appeared in the expert press and the work of the Rówak - air torpedo and air rocket bomb was published in the following year.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, with all the military use projects, the rocket technology was dedicated to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (The Temporary Advisory Committee) which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ended the beginning of the war.
Further work on cosmonautics has appeared after the war in Polish press due to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polish Astronautical Society).
For the first time, there is a mention of a company in November's issue of 1954 magazine Problems, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowiczs, it is designed to create a company that will deal with cosmonauts.
The projects of artificial satellites were already being developed at that time and it was clear that space research was a prospective industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautic Federation (founded 1951) and has already become a proper member in autumn.
And in the following year, the first President of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been a major player in the development of a very successful RRM meteorological rocket (Explosive Package), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket was about 80 cm long and the weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved RM-1A version was built, and in the summer of 1959 it was launched in the Bledov Desert for two-stage RM-2 rockets.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type had already been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have reached up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, further developments were suspended in 1962.
The first RM rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting mass was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that differed the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was a space with a volume of 0,4 litres, a Meteor-1B with a volume of 0,34 litres and a Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, there was a development of the Meteor-2 missile in the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
As a result, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and to establish the National Committee COSPA for two years later.
Poland was also involved in the research of space space in Soviet artificial satellites in the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remk.
The cancellation of the Act on Public Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court of Law on Public Works deleted last week.
The resolution sparked a live discussion in public.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue in a broader sense.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict among themselves.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, nothing unlimited movement of private capital along with unnecessary financial speculation.
In effect of considerable differences in labour price, price pressure occurs.
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the situation where the producer tries to import cheap goods to market in competition by "falseing" the competitive price of the competitor with a view to placing greater market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
In mass scale, this means either transfer production to a foreign country or to a cheap purchase or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for unemployment produced, social expenditure of the State is necessarily rising.
The whole situation has the total willingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus to replace the economic and social damage that he had committed in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so generally known that specific statistical data should not be reported.
Unsustainable practices of private capital create situations in each economy where governments of each country are forced to enter mutual competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to the people regardless of the social downturn.
This is primarily reflected in the changes in the law in force.
The aim is to economically force the self-inhabitor to adopt a pricing dictate of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
However, this is happening in the case of long-term unemployment, but the limitation of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, increasing poverty, along with the rise in differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been a number of years of public food outlets for poor people who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is normal for people who are properly employed to receive such wages that they must be paid to existential minima.
Such scandal was published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Chamber.
The contested measures of virtually all the southern EU countries certainly lead to the same condition when people are forced to emigrate, either in the 19th century or live for hungry wages on the outskirts of society, hoping that there may be private investment capital to the country.
But where does it have to be asked where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all over Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media are saying that the state cannot take capital part in its own economy that controlled economies lead to economic disaster.
Private capital is insisting on the opinion that the State may not interfere with the economy through its management interventions.
Then it should be asked whether private capital does not influence, it now actually controls politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is practically all-powerful and in all states present lobby.
As a result, it is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, by providing mutual advantages, by law, where everything is virtually punishable, but nothing punishable.
In the SRN, the situation is that the State Department for lack of funds is setting up proposals for law to private law firms that are wasteful in connection with industry.
These legislative proposals are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as declared by the Institutes of the Western Type, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly becoming into a situation, as Appianos described in his work by the Republic of Rome during the times of Caesar and Pompeia:"The state has long been fully decompositioned, and the authorities have been under violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisitions of yarn and using stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were not missing at all, so one time, as a result of this coup, it was to stand out for eight months without a consults."It was really said that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man."The Appianas was thinking of Pompeia, but it became Caesar, who changed to a lasting democracy in self-government.
Conclusion Like in the Antica, the current company is based on the carefree preferences of its own benefit regardless of all-Societal interest.
The capital of the company is no longer able to understand and apply the social benefits.
The result is now, as was then, an unprecedented decade of elites without any effort to reform the deeper landscape.
We therefore need to seek the Kauzality of the arrival of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracy can be regarded as a certain break with the expectations of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the present elites completely ignore in the future hundreds of thousands of losses on lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The cancellation of the Act on Public Works is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted by political-social reforms that will strengthen state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the impact of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolies position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: A chaos laboratory.
"There's nothing coming out of violence and never can" Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be none" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, many reactions have taken place.
One stands behind Israel, asserts his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians match the role of terrorists, other support Palestinians, argue the racism of Israel, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodic repeated waves of killing with a culprit and who victims, after all, of today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-government territories, were born into the current political situation and the beginning of violence they did not experience.
I would like to offer the readers a view of the curtain, a view of who, above all, has been serving 95 years of lasting tension (calculated since Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) on a small portion of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the historical facts available, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or who a group of people is the main driver of modern history events.
Human history is the first history of a power struggle.
In every era, we can watch one of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so obvious is whether they were always these personalities, who were totally driving their footsteps and, or whether someone behind their throne was standing, who directed their actions to their previous target.
We have to admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and their resulting power could not occur in the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, there is one that could consider itself as the head of the octopus (if someone still stands over them, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschield.
It's not a lot to write about.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop their name being linked to high criminal acts, in which backgrounds were held, and which always meant power fixing, multiplying wealth or both.
They have a major share in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in central banks do not lead or prepare wars (before attacking Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the execution of Gadddafi only remained four, but in the meantime Russia was subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to raise this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began to hand out his own money during the Civil War (see government) and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, he was murdered 1963, Member of Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for the release of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 to 1871 to formulate the plan of the three world wars by the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial rule, especially the Great Britain and the third is to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere at 0.5 - 1 billion people (this amount of slaves for their comfort and luxury enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but presupposes for such solutions) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by Rothschild works is the emergence of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration (see the founding of the FED in order to prevent crises such as the one they caused in 1907).
So after they had succeeded in murdering the habsbury successor to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the first world war was destroyed by the death of a Bolshevik revolution in Russia.
The first world war ended with sudden, military and economically unjustified capitalization of Germany (the need for war to destroy the Cararist Russia) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European powers, Austria Uherska.
For the easier resolution of World War II, policy bankers have allowed them to create a latant conflict situation by placing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a predominant radicalisation of the impoverished masses, and then just enough just to substantiate the Germans with sufficient strong, guilty and simple solution offering the Leader and the creation of a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in the light of a war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield was driven by the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought the creation of the Jewish state, preferredly in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration has created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
World War II broke out of the chain where international bankers held it at the beginning, or everything that was done in the plan is difficult to estimate, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in concessions created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state of the world.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like the war reparations of Germany were made for World War II, the outbreak of the Third War was created by the State of Israel.
If international bankers manage to release it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the victim in the first line of combat, now along with Arab or generally Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of silhouette and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let's take care of how strongly people are divided into the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim in Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where wrongs the wrongdoers in an endless chain of violence, when at first everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish the free inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, they substantiate international bankers to choose only their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is Netanyahu, a typical example of the fascinating international bankers, a policy that does everything to remove war with Iran, which, due to Iran's membership in Shanghai, is only 2 miles wide), threatens to grow into a global conflict and in view of the control of Iran over the Hormuz Canal, which travels 20% of all world oil (pulsor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their vision is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And he forces all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have on the right hand or on the forehead of the men, so that he cannot buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of that beast or the digit of her name.
It's important to understand who's reason to read the numbers of the beast.
That number marks a man, and it's a number of sixty-six."
Argo movie: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied a crowd demonstrating the Islamic students of the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the rejected Shah Mohammed Réz Páhlaví, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - to throw the crew overboard could not afford because it would significantly jeopardise the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after the negotiations was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their doing so at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Saran sentiment.
He contributed significantly in Iran to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a little victory.
Six employees escaped from the embassy just before the embassy arrived.
After the complex peripeties, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, helping the extravagant cover story – they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who looked at the location in the country for the filming of Sci-Fi's generous film.
A combination of genres
The plan, which was developed by an expert on "exfiltration" by Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, organized by a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been classified for a long time, and the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's movie is a special combination of more genres.
On one hand, the realisticly understood political thriller, also called "caper movie", the story of the issued piece, the sub-inhibition - an example of the series of Danny's partners.
In the film the moods are changed - on the one hand documentaryly captured sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was presented in the film - big differences are not in it).
On the other hand, the light passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a mild overweight.
And then the scene from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits, take the situation out of class tables, office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable way to relaunch his career.
From a mocked actor, he became a respected director and his acting stopped being the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark feeds of Goon Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck film that doesn't take place in the director's Boston home.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films increased over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are held in the streets, when reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that arises when history is cleared somewhere.
Affleck and his co-workers have a similar effect in the scenes of fiction (the false staff on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of tense scenes.
Quite successfully working with it, sometimes he will think of something - there everything is already not so elegant (a place in which a crisis at the Tehran airport will reverse the call in America and the hunt after the ranch is very attached to hair).
However, the weak of Arga is the dissatisfaction resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in roles of Hollywood co-workers, though very shaming, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film is losing a bit of a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be followed with a mild interest, to appreciate the realization and retro style of the evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
But it'll only rip off hard.
As a reminder of one yet certain way of living history and proof of how the ideas of all-powerful and knowledgeful secret services are exaggerated, but will suffice.
Rules for the inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovniplatky.com, who announces each year the survey of the most ambitious bank fee, has now decided to launch a contest on "the most beautiful regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We thought about the last event when the EU plans to accept a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
For example, there is already a recent decision by the European Court on the unification of the premium for men and women between the nominal absurdity.
So far, women at the cost of life insurance were at a disadvantage because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote alone will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The EU's controversial regulation should also include the mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuels, which, as a result of damage to nature, also prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances or a directives on the size of chicken cages, which gave the eggs a significantly betrayed this year.
Critices were also faced with an actual ban on the use of pure butter or the elimination of classic bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The EU Apache often decides under the pressure of either the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now also threatens the veto to promote the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby stood even after, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in length and could not show 'anomanal curvature'.
The European Commission has defended itself by simply harming the current unifying national standards that complicate trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened the EU through the opposition of some States, pointing to the fact that the existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation can also be a candidate for victory, according to which it must be mandatory to warn children under 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocate.
Similar restrictions are now valid for children under 14 years when blowing into leaves.
Curious ideas are born at home
Quite absurd is then also the rule concerning the European officials themselves - everyone who has an official function in the EU cannot, in view of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, use the name Macedonia and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Server Banking Fees.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, was nominated for an survey in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdity regulations on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food supplies that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume of preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened by a high fine.
Even the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies at the request of the grant was interesting.
However, these ideas did not exist in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're being manipulated by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, a lot of grain was born in our country, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, it was meant to be a full warehouse that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic continues to join its ports, the EU seems to have paid us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission has come out of the Czech Republic to meet the fact that it has organized a track to purchase grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant grant grants were offered by the municipalities of the Ministry of Local Development, controlled by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), specifically to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarne regulations are an exception
While the Regulation is easy for Member States to become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to work more effectively and develop the Union as a whole, they deserve recognition by a number of experts.
The more serious problem is, for example, the use of EU subsidies to projects that do not have anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have forced Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotion between the Czech Republic also encourages the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, not always succeeding in this match.
Although after a six-year struggle with the Germans and the Rakušany, the Czechs have defended the markings of the Olomoucian shapes, but the local rum, whose tradition is in our home until the 19th century, must have been renamed by our producers.
The names of rum may only be carried by products of cane distillation, not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, world-renowned cheeses of feta and gorgonzol, Marcipan of German Lübeck or Parm hams have already been found, for example, carlovar droughts, bitter and turbulent cap and grybian hops.
The protection mark of the EU can then also be proud of the pardubic mercenary and magnesium tube.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I don't care about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not going anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country's recent 20 years sneaking around, as thieves run, people are increasing taxes and the age of retirement.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But seeing something I don't like, I'm trying to come up with a way to change it.
And since I've been 40 and I'm an independent alien, I have no choice but to influence things than run for Senator or President.
You got to the Senate, but you ran into the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to go to the Castle fight, based on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I explained that if I'm elected a senator, I'm running for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is an instrument, as I can perform my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and most powerful mandate.
But the trouble is, not only is it that we're broadcasting as a nation in a pub and on TV, but we're going to follow anyone who wants to try to change.
This is what media are added to, which dehonetize man, and who are wrong with freedom of speech and freedom to lie.
I may have been claimed to be paying off by journalists, or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your vision.
In the fight for the Castle you went with the present material and criminal liability of politicians and remunerated property returns over 20 million.
That's what you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can design laws.
How are you going to solve this?
When I was a citizen lobbying for freedom of movement, I managed to enforce it.
The problem is politics - if someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, he rejects himself on purpose, and the citizens abstain.
As an independent distance, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party turquoise and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, on each side and apply it.
Are you more of a man of right or left?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people are more like the left.
It's not important to me at all, whether a little left or a bit to the right.
It's important for me to go ahead.
I don't care if anyone belongs to a left or right, but I want to connect.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against bad ideas.
You joke when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Someone can call it populism, but all the proposals that I'm talking about are already in the world, or they are talking about major experts.
But without Parliament's support, all you have left is a password.
And with that, you don't get enough in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them that you can intercede for example criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to sell it.
If I were elected president, there is no problem holding a direct transmission, where I will ask the President of Parliamentary Parties to establish material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they'd have to tell us why they don't want it.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name nebula, you can push on the political scene.
Take the president's direct choice, that was the merit of public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not even a genius, not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to look for allies.
In politics I have just begun and for my program I will try to obtain majority support.
I try to move things on my own, unless it doesn't work out, I'll end up in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've been hugging a number of well-known people, whether they'd also go to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, the one who refused to do a lot of work.
So at least I supported an investment journalist, Jan Lorenc, who covered frauds with light fuel oils.
I was running for people to be really disgruntled, but now I'm on weights.
Sixty percent of people didn't vote, and the ones who went usually chose the representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen a Senate to enforce changes difficult.
Yet, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you considering establishing your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't have money for a presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have money?
You're talking about property returns, how is it yours?
Private property, I estimate about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a transaction of Superb for millions, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin, I have it because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against badness and bad things.
You're driving an Aston Martin, you got $60 million worth of property, and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money in it too much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I owe myself that?
I've hit the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests he's probably not so interested in my program.
And I don't have a duty campaign to pay off my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to receive from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of him, for example, I couldn't pay my son to an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not going anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd dampen these activities?
But that's not related to pay.
As I promised, I partially covered my activities.
For example, a travel agent becomes my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I need to live from something, too.
How old were you as a businessman to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I take next.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You can find the full interview in Saturday's Law release.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only in the head - for example Spikenisse and recently built Mount books - 2 images
"This building feels happy, looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby big business, says, "Oh, everybody, this house is nice."
However, I ask what else we need a library today.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one volunteered to go to any of these old-style libraries today, do they?
Spikenisse, a place close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not worth visiting, holds a special record.
This population with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision to contribute to general education and to build seven well-painted reinforced irony miniature fictional bridges, which are displayed on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was no doubt.
And so city councillors have learned that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wines Maas of the Rotterdam architectural atelier MVRDV, master of insanely courageous column graphs and creator of funny, often even cynic buildings, accepted the thing with the usual peace and competition in 2003 appeared with five books under the arm and an arch on the face.
And while the commission looked around and shrugged its shoulders, hard Maas took his gifts on himself by size and his actively justified speech to end with the words "Dear urban community!"
So this is my proposal for the Top of Books in Spitkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was concentrated for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and serial houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The Malocity Shid, which has not yet been able to offer more than postmodern walking zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for whose white facade you would expect a dairy, makes it richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
First of all, Spikenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
Long Path to the Book
First impression: The reader's eldright under the lid on the cheese.
Although through massia the mountains ride the elevator, you will discover the real spatial and readers' passions as far as you can climb the topography.
From all sides of the glassed interior is bright and clear, the floor of a burnt convertible and elegant street mirrors clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys playing football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally standing racks with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly inconsistencies and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have built a classic spatial configuration upside down and space for readers has been removed from the inside.
The interior of the Mountains of books is widely used: there are offices, Internet library, chess club, ecological center, and center of home technology.
The special comfort is black cheeks on books, which are once walled, with one parapet, and another railing stairs.
Look, the structure and smell are foreign.
In addition to the unknown building material, he cuts heads with even an oath of architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at Spikenisse city village, on the question of Standard magazine.
And so one day, we hit an appropriate agricultural waste product in one of the ferret farms.
For many years in glasses and fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a basis under the roots of millimetres made of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and effective in time.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then it's mature to dump in bulk waste.
For the library there was arouno - for the first time in such quantity - placed on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By means of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) will color in a dark, homogenous and burdensome material that smells a little bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps, you get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 metres of long traveling you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only by a fantastic view of the city, but also by Dutch croquets and figs in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but especially the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glassed areas, a demonstration project on ecology," says Trouborst.
It melts and cools with the Earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines in only a short time, even in sunny days.
The wide glued wooden mattes, which are standing perpendicular to the glassed facade, serve as a cover and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The clip in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will handle fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from IT business, has already visited a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogorde, who even refers to "the ancient expected soul" Spikenisse.
Reason: every resident of the city was invited to open one book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should first be filled with optical gaps in so far not completely equipped library, which currently comprises 70,000 pieces.
The concept is proven.
The police are completely filled up.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone has a relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decorating.
This was the result of MVRDV’s success in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon is called the formation of an identity.
Spikenisse wrote history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert in relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Shabo, Berlin is rambling on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany initially indicated at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for an observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations Organization.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Shabo: Germany does not support what Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll even support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
In March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting as a result of the establishment of an air-free zone.
NATO finally rented it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of a policy that was so-called controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult to say that Europeans do not have a coherent and united policy.
The Germans are therefore among the two fronts.
They expect them to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're still living in their role, but they're on their way to "the more normal" foreign policy.
For foreign policy that they have in France or in the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to engage in national interests and positions that are independent of US or European partners' positions.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the attitudes in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First of all, Germany has a large site in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf of Persia.
Therefore, it must be careful not to deter the public, but neither the elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
I wouldn't want to add too much meaning to it, but that's not a very unilateral relationship.
However, it plays a major role in German considerations, as a matter of fact.
Did Germany’s relations with the US have damaged when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that Europe and even the US have a great understanding of the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was in Libya's question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
This indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US made a clear statement for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of America's internal policy.
I think Obama's government probably has a deep understanding of the European position.
But as a result of that political situation, this position cannot, of course, be public.
I think differences in opinions are not really as big as they always seem.
If you look at Obama's relationship with President Netanyahu's Prime Minister, Obama's not very excited about Netanyahu's politics at all.
It is difficult for Germany to bring its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germany to have a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not happening.
They cannot, therefore, be part of a wider line and they must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, for a relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take the lead role?
Or is Germany’s leading role still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country it is still difficult for obvious reasons to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a greater role, anti-German mood will arise.
It doesn't make it easier for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly decreasing, but the EU does not currently meet this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes it even more unliked - c'est la via!

"Security" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This hides the markings that are officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he has been enjoying protection until they are sued by actual brand owners.
And even then, it's not clear whether it's gonna be a good law.
"For a stranger, it is increasingly difficult to protect its brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in breaking protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, he's gonna land a new case on my desk.
The counterfeiters need a few extra letters to sign their plates.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead Prada they will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens up the stamp office organizer in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had protected Zegna DF Puma's trademark. A bold name that was paralysing even at the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese masters of the world are in copying and violation of intellectual property.
There are several storey houses in large cities where counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattlochov's cases are different, but from the mandate of his mandants, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies receive completely officially the right to use the markings that are already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word is focused on Bang Dakuan.
That's what women mean, who hunt for wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages business, we have to beat it," calls Pattloch.
"The woman breaks up, the sole position disappears, the damage to image is huge."
Financial losses and judicial costs of the affected businesses go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to CLSA's data, China is the largest market in luxury products and the market for the third year as fast as possible.
However, the erasure of questionable records in the stamp register can be difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
Driving can go up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court rejected the action because the name concerned has become a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the defendant has bad luck, the plagiarian must still pay because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
The known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sana's building machinery, a company recently taken over by the German manufacturer of pumps on the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
For this reason, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. Spor was compared, Geely had to change the logo.
A manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little number of employees and space.
But last year, reportedly, 'the work process' returned from an emergency situation to normal'.
For example, the number of unworked proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
There were 57,000 of these cases, 75 percent more than the previous year.
Still, there are 81,500 complaints about the settlement still waiting for the Authority.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As often as it is in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, over 1.4 million brand protection applications were delivered to the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
That's a record, and that means that China is leading a list of new applications all over the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - 5,5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected on charges.
This simply means that each log on average is worth 1280 yüan or EUR 160.
It costs several times to start a dispute, showing the case of the family family family Freudenberg.
This concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for over seven years.
While the Germans achieved that it had been repealed by its illegal production of imitated automotive parts.
However, the counterfeiter has maintained Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the objection of Munich companies.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has exercised rights, but the opponent is still fighting today.
We need to be very careful.
Now the matter is discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and commend the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "Dealing is extremely expensive, and it costs us much time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archive, they even had to look at 100 years of old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the counterparty a "six-digit amount in euro" in vain for the purpose of settlement of the dispute.
"You see what this means to us," says Wentzler.
It threatens that the dangers of the Far East will hit Europe as well.
And that's when the imitators are there to secure the unprotected markings.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This business area has long given up the company, yet it has been able to reverse the registration.
"You must be careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in the trade with China.
Foreigners should rather "all that is worth protecting, even in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg is subject to the mark in the last act of his drama, the counterparty will probably have to pay the license fee for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: ass, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbong congregation is tested - and in Swaziland the orphans are delighted with the parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's ass: cowboy's tall shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins looking for a park tact and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then they slowly raise the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they pour on, moms and each other.
The 29-year-old Fiete Hopfa conductor almost lifts it from his textile shoes when it connects the voices with its fervent gestures.
There's a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
There were 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years, from human genetic researchers to their homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each congregation voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - a zulu, which speaks 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to Help Your Help
Unaids, the United Nations programme to defeat AIDS, estimates that there are some 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of which, 23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
There are 245 000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents who died on AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, a company of Voices for Africa was found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second degree school.
For EUR 15 or 20 per month, the patron may be taken over.
He guarantees a child's school uniform and one warm meal a day in Gogo-centre.
Imbong means "repeater of stories" in the language of the zulum or "one who praises".
No one can talk in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes it brings them back where they originally come from: the south of Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitjeni in the north-east of the St.
Forty percent is infected
Some of them live there in some 2,000 people, some of them in simple clays, or wordless waiters, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they've been following your HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, it is seen in small, stinuing all of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infectibility, the lowest expected lifelongs worldwide according to UNICEF.
A male foreplay, which clearly reduces the risk of a disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity. There is no rare that they die in less than thirty years.
He discovered this village during a joint tour of Africa in spring 2005. First of all, members of Imbong saw many children on the streets that were missing not only parental care, but quite all: food, clothing, education.
Without a completed school education, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros each year, made it possible to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the "Voices for Africa" congregation was established, which has been looking after orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually portable infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia and capa (gonorea) belong to the bacterial SPI.
Fluid, human papillomavir, gentilalis, or hepatitis are frequent viral SPIs.
Mustards and svrabs belong to the parasitary SPI.
Who belongs to the most disabled?
Syphilis and cauliflower are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
Robert Love's constitution, based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transferred by sexual relations between men.
In heterosexual adults, there are sexually communicable diseases that occur frequently, chlamydi infections, trichomydias, candidiasis (gas), capa and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 percent of those newly infected with HIV appear to be on this group.
Chlamydi infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among our adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syphilis is more than doubled in 2001 according to the Department of Robert Love of 1697.
The number of newly infected HIVs has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, about 2700 cases were reported.
That's about one tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms point to sexual disease?
Infections may cause ulcers in the area of genitalia, difficulties in urination, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
However, dangerous diseases may reduce condoms but do not offer 100% protection.
For the originator of sexually transmitted diseases may be partially passed on to infections from impurities and narrow physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, particularly in case of frequent sorting of sex partners.
In case of early diagnostics, most SPIs may be treated and prevented subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patron, charity donations and, last but not least, to honoraries who make singing throughout Germany, some money will be gathered.
"We have sent about EUR 200,000 to Esitjane," says President of the Association of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany manages in the village of Zodów Promini, a confident woman who can intercede.
He also cares about finding shelters, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as it is called in the language of the zulu, is the resistance of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they make sure that the children come to school every day in their uniforms.
Children who don't have anyone else go to the Khanyisile shelter, a lonely woman who pays as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" started a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the US Health Organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village had done an HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 Wifes
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
Actually, it's pretty strange in a country where the King officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarchy of black Africa, the King of Mswati III, is known for his inexhaustible lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This country of approved lifestyle also blames, among other things, that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But many migrant workers who have spread the virus to the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are on every corner free of charge, but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
In order to at least support cultural exchange, the Imbong congregation travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sing songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and the confidence of the black people, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black talk - such an award does not only bring mood and joy, but tears have already been eliminated in many wild border soldiers.
The journey also leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have a patron.
Even though you can hardly find this village on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than famous.
"Go to Esther, there's a light," people say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is airline 8733 kilometers from here, to a bountiful singer in trial at Bergheimer Straße, you see that this light shines even here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
Sonda Messenger found evidence on the planet Mercury ice.
Ice blanket could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) has shown the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as it shows from three studies, which on Thursday published the specialist magazine "Science".
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It's said to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not find ice for the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of the scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
Temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, undetected Earthmen, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, there are images of Earth, little window to endless distances.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
As with Pluto, which runs behind Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006 "planeto".
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "born portrait" of countless stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, less identifiable are pink-colored "new-rozeniat" in the birth hall of stars.
This area where the stars are formed - scientists unromanticly call it W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia's constellation at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changeable heat of dying stars caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The left-hand ring consists of material that the star has mutilated during the dying process.

One of Hubble's biggest and sharpest pictures: Viper galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxy, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The collection published by the European Southern Observatory shows several thousand light-years away from Trifid mlhovin in the constellation Shooting.
The name Triphid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, three-klanny), for the dark strips of dust divides the heart of this star midwife into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the predominant cosmic crash: at 400 million light-years away from Earth, the core of two congested galaxys were married, and must inevitably occur a collision.
This birth star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not like technical shortcuts can call it nicknamed South Winder.
Photographs from Hubble's space telescope show off the lris nebula in Cefea constellation.
This 1400 light years away is made up of dust grains, which are 10 times as many as 100 times as normal domestic dust.
This image was drawn from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
Shows a ring from a black hole, which is 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC scientists 1810.
The brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is found in this starry.
The collage of the stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, this star cloud, associated with the young Rosette, is still born by new young stars, which are 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
There is no dust yet in this bright shining galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only soon after the Great Bang when there was a hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, still before Galileo, who later used him to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes has been increasing - and the views that are mediated are still deeper.
The biggest telescope in the world was for 30 years, ranging from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope to Palomar Observatorys near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was an average of five meters.
In Arizona, Large Binocular Telescope stands.
Allows to look into space using just two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias interior on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10,4 metres on average.
Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to cover costs.
Yet his diameter is about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by an angler at a height, which is limited by its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high increase in light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Through the radiotelescope in Arecib (Portoriko) scientists are searching in the universe after extraterrestrial signals.
This radiotelescope has an average of 305 meters.
At the "Search for Extrarestrinal Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who makes it available for its computational performance.
View of observer of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chinese Andes.
Very Large Telescope stands here and is honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can light up even the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for the chil observers of the ESO.
Its main mirror is designed to be full of 42 metres and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on Hawaii's volcano Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest until 2007.
They're just offering two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition, looks into space through both Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also in Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-meter diameter of a mirror.
Here you can admire it on the picture.
However, the most significant impressions of space give us Hubble's space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing us with a collection of distant worlds.
The Kepler telescope has been searching since March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially for those who are residents.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The images document the latest preparations before launching the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope James Webba (JWST) will be fired first in 2018 into space on board the Ariane rocket5.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies in the Big Bang.
Scientists come from the fact that ice is also on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data to this effect, as the Messenger is moving far closer to the North Pole around this planet.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to roam around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

Search for footprints in a country where the 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to burn Talyz down. We can call it wildly romantic.
Microbus rushes along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, ferocious rivers and plain selian builds.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the nearest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyšites lives, which is not known too much, except that they speak perfectly of Persians and spays and live very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is chased by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not an option in picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here, the arrival of the capital city of Baku in Azerbaijan is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-time.
The fairy-tale wealth that the country owes in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
Pilata Fatulajev (48) is convinced, however, that Lerik has the power to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Prize of Eurovision in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulajev.
He's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life is documented by almost eight dozen Talyšů from the surrounding area, who are over 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, the child was yet fathered.
However, the opposite star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep Müslümov, who was reported to be 168 years old.
But there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with evidence was 122 years old, Müslüm’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and 1973 died," explains Fatulajev.
This man was reported to have been married three times and had 23 children.
So was he not wrong about the Müslümov’s age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the flight people in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or Hunz Valley in Pakistan, many people of high age live," says Scholz, "also on Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
However, due to missing evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik experience Bible - age markedly often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why, then, is he living here in the south of so many summer people?
Azerbaijan's Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talys.
On the contrary, the director of Fatuljeev Museum believes it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of the Talys who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily is so healthy, it is not exactly credible from a bromothological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near Lerik, Rubaba Mirzajev lives.
In 97 years, she's still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirajev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the ground with a butterball that's tirelessly collapsing.
There are eight people under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirajev and a daughter, both of them a long time ago grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in typical "armadu" glasses.
Mirajev's white teeth form a perfect line, and under the suture, she hides long dark blonde pieces, which proudly reveals her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo like that," says Mirajev.
Monthly pension enough to live
She always ate what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst in World War II.
But it all improved when the oar took over the "loved father" Gejdar Alijev.
The propaganda sounds strange to an old woman.
However, a cult that takes place around the character of the father of the nations who ruled his country as dictator in Azerbaijan does not know the limits.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham's address.
The old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer need.
Marzajeva gets a personal pension every month of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euro). This is at the current ratio of the obsolescence from which it can be well enjoyed.
And he may be right, even the long - term gray son of Mirazzia,: "The old people are of great importance in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Institute is missing
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The sustained demonstration in Cairo revealed the deep fragmentation of the country.
It is very much discussed by the future constitution based on the law of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president didn't save the pathos.
We have to make a transition.
"And for that we will succeed, I am responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Kopts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly disputed in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "godly state" on the Nile given to grace the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and extended his own to save revolutions.
But what 61-year-old engineer who has a degree in the U.S. University of Southern California really wants to save has neither the Egyptians nor the world clear.
Is the justice to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs that the chief Constitutional Assembly, with the predominance of Islamists, has rapidly approved in a 15-hour night marathon, partly stimulates concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is founded on the "results of Islamic law".
But what does the principle mean?
That was and is the matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formula and the associated legal free space for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least, it illuminates the new paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the crucifix will exercise control over the rule of law, which would bring justice to a real sense of self-righteousness.
There are many aspects of interpretation in the Constitution's proposal
The problem is also that civil rights of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, it should also protect the "right essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is so vaguely formulated on a legal basis that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature through this paragraph.
In a understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
However, no paragraph in writing defines the comprehensive equality of men and women.
Another paragraph prohibits a disgrace or apologizing to the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what is shameful and how it will be pursued.
Similarly, formulate that it is forbidden to "damaged people".
Is it enough in this case that the president's caricature or the joke on the lawyers' rights account?
The issue of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Mursi will present for signature and, according to his words, will be "very soon" to present to Egyptians for the purpose of the human vote.
"Revolution Returns"
For several weeks, the opposition against overslamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday night in the square of Tahrir in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional list before it began paying.
"Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed himself in the presidential elections in third place.
Nobel Prize winner and former CEO of the Mohammed Baradej International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the constitution's proposal was "in the history site".
Through the services of short news, Twitter has accused the campaigner Mursi that they want to make a "supply against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw him down," said Jesir Said's opposition member.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not punished," quoted the Egyptian media of the opposition policy Chálida Alli.
Several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
A well organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a kindness, but with caution not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the second bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
She was involved with many women who were arrested and supporters of the Salafis who called, "People are demanding the application of God's law."
They called Mursi, "Clean the earth!" and assured them, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrír, where it all began, would probably cause a state similar to civil war.
Apparently, Mursi's supporters didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opposers and advocates of the draft Constitution were loud and conspicuous.
Now it's time to let the people at the constituency decide which direction the country should go.
The majority is considered to be in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is said Hafiza Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-year-old human rights defender and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were held in prison for Mubarak or stood trial.
Not because they share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now, the words 'human rights' are not even once," complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous accusation against democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"It is necessary that the President of the Civil Society strengthens, effectively cancels it," complains Sa'd.
But without civil society organisations democracy can't work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by an international community that follows the fight of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of the way.
The demonstrant in Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you no longer control."
Norwegian Cancer: The world's most stinking fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success secret be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take some mature cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Leave it a week.
So you get a smell of paralyzing smell of cancer, one of the Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a wonderful view - and there's all sorts of smell in the air.
The Rakfisk is a salted trout hydrated in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, Norwegians are starting to meet here in Fagernes at a festival dedicated to the best, the most subtle food to say it.
"You eat it raw, and then you drink it with an aquavit glass," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival's course.
People all around us eat small cubes fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to aquavite than cancer," Havard says.
The voltage can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi, which was on a long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was a poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, fish were carried out in autumn into air-tight waters with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well crinkled, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly covered with alcohol.
Before just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, most of whom emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% are immigrants who are attracted to a large number of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who had been much richer recently than Norway, flow to the ground for work.
The cancer is seen as important, indispensable, although a relatively stinking part of the Norwegian past.
These include more expensive dishes on the market.
Even though expensive everything is - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will come out for 9 pounds (14 dollars) a piece.
Norway often does not get into worldwide reports - and most people seem to comply with this.
The name Anderse Breivika, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here are still mentionable.
Instead, the shooting is called "the sound of July 22."
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful land one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth lies in the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waiter Anna, who with his long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the prototype of the nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely amazing.
We don't show up, we don't like showing off.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - besides a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a specific fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to a global financial crisis threw away money that they did not have, the Norwegians had cords on their own bowls.
"Although we can ski in winter and take trips in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - a coffin I've had enough.
Such a random burger is certainly something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight's the stinking fish back here.
The hotel where I live is one of many places where cancer is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smelliest fish.
They have a connection with a live TV transmission, in which the moderator with a butterfly surrounded by a plate with a rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our stab, Havarde."
It's called applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, possibly forced by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fishes.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant looks at the challenges facing the BBC and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked even in the best times, steel weapons have been raised closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent those arriving in order to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's ahead of the challenge.
Mexico has done well well at the time of the delinquent Felipe Calderon’s office, but the country is in the clutches of the drug war that has already been estimated to have been 60 000 lives for six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shakes hands with the US President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are different in his old home, a people's and vast state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in good times.
Citizens assign to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive into the city on one of the new motorways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the horrific and rough roads that were here before.
The board also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with topics of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and permanent change," says friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Member behind President Pen Nieta, Party of the institutionalised revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of safety and the economy that our country needs so badly.
After 81 years of power, the party of PRI was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Member of Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace, Los Pinos is expecting many inside the party from Enrique Pena Nieta.
And refuses to express the opposition characterizing the new president as a man without material content.
He is a very direct man, very impressed with the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people from their former governor.
In Nehualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad No, cannot be contrasted with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
Strangled under highway ramps in many memories of the suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the local government are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help master the drug gangs operating in the quarters, particularly pressing is violence on women.
Only in the last two years, waste dumps have been dumped by dozens of murdered women.
At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Nieta's critic says that he failed to deal with women's murder when he was in office.
And in worse case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the lost neighborhood, Irina Buendia shows photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner was murdered.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone washed her body," Mrs. Buendia recalls.
There were signs of punches on it and postmortem mammary has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which the only word is "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was denied them.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossipy, troublemaker and a moustache.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it cannot be right when there are so many mistakes and forget," he says.
The Šerpa, which President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families have been hit by violent crime in Mexico, and the new president promised that he would be a priority for him in the office.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says Valle del Bravo PRI Olvera.
This, however, is exactly what the victims' families do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning wasn't complaining about the wrong treatment, claimed by the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to deny Bradley Manning's claims on gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected based on the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest escape from classified material in the history of the United States, has missed many possibilities to complain about the gross treatment that he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor, May May. Ashden Fein, during the cross-interrogation hearing of Private Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers unit during nine months of custody in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about bad treatment.
The cross-appeal that occurred during the hearing carried out on a proposal to reject the case against Manning due to gross treatment at the time of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in custody.
An analyst of military intelligence arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning carried out the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning in a detention prison in Quantico, where he was held in a scheme with increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was assessed as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints about bad treatment, even though Officer Manning was directly asked how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concerns about various problems and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these fears and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"There were no problems," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lindning also asked why he did not complain about treatment with his person in January 2011 when he met with the commission judging suicide thoughts, which he had expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The military said that this restrictive regime (one degree under suicide supervision) used it to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the overseers in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... to enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning reported on Thursday his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to a prison prison in prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and he passed out for heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the world was very daunting.
"My world was smurfed only on Arifdžán base, on that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after his arrival in Quantica spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, a blanket, a noodles, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying was during the day against the regulations.
Manning said he always slept with a light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint against Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he raised on Thursday's statement concerning the fact that after having been forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners in the morning count.
Manning said that he was not allowed to cover his blanket while counting.
On Friday's hearing by Judge Manning, he stated that on the order of his officers, he judged that he had a blanket he could hide, postpone, but admitted that no one had given him the order to put it away.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show his officer he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said that he told an officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his protagonists to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that the night of his cell was removed from his underwear, his binders and glasses.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into consideration his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his testimony before the military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense indicated that it was planning to confess to Manning's guilt in lower criminal acts and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend binding conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations concerning all arrests held in custody with maximum security.
The accusations brought against Manning include the aid to the enemy, the unlawful cause of publication of intelligence documents online, the transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone away, reminding them of their hard times, says.
Navorrette says that the Mexican Americans are lapenes between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico's capital, I barely had the crowd and arrived in the immigration agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for the "Mexicanos" and the other for the "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I've been standing there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later I ended up with the term Mexican American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use the shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native spokesperson and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and put myself in line for the EXTranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment this week when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House.
The programme had usual issues to be discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Noto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican War against drug cartels even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced his leader under the threat of weapons to translate half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the distance of centuries, not minutes, the comments are public.
So one minute after the U.S. leaders say something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will go on a war trail.
And yet Mexico has a real challenge with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
It's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or a grandparents, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not towards Mexico.
And even though we now live an American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but loyalty is not ours.
He's towards the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as a sublime race, which is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And we wouldn't now be lying behind a silk tire with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, who legally travelled to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans are not fond of it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, he looks at us like Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And in order to make relationships even more complicated, some mechanical leaders and some intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to connect again with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as the "providing ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should call our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and pressure on political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States what they did with Mexico before one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unfavorable for how they were treated with their family members in a substantially closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The termination of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that each such act is futile.
More than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis, were killed by rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and at the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to have stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed its order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in a constant chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their lethal stalemate situation.
War that isn't even won or lost.
At first sight, it seems that there are not many reasons to be optimized at present.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st, the fights from this week would be strengthened by the cranes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that reigned in Gaza since 2007, will argue that they forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gaza’s population in one of the most vital and human corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another portion of Palestine, which is currently managed by its hard rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
The Islamists have gained more influence all over the Arab world, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the once again resurrected regional power that was the closest Muslim ally to Israel, joined Hamas. So did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamical countries in the Gulf.
The apprehension of Hamas says that the Islamic Midmonths encircled around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the party/milice of Hezbollah, across Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly intertwined to Islamism, can sit down Bashar Asad, until Jordan, where the Hamas allies threaten the king.
First of all, on the southern wing of Israel the rise of Muslim fraternity under President Muhammad Mursi's leadership in Egypt has changed far from the country's most human and severe Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular despot that reigned in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is Hamas' cousin and his leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
Hamas may appear in future diplomacy as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hard - line advocates will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's anti-raket system Iron dome has proven its price and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas from the launch of the final round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively peaceful from suicide bombers, part of the walls that interfere with the West Bank, the main part of what may once be the Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
The Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side of Likud, at the beginning of the campaign to the elections on January 22nd, joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the wounded Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they set off missiles like they did to their villagers in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them with their heads.
Maybe the hard lines are winning, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel's defense expenses are higher than the expenses of all his four Arab neighbors together.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi was working with President Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
Also, Israelis should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates denying the rights of the Palestinians to self-determinate the barrel with gunpowder, which must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, the repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
Blood outages against Gaza taking place every few years to suppress Hamas will continue to be collecting diplomatic tax.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what intelligent people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states when Israel takes the territory for safety.
In the short term, there is a little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressures from outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must establish for the ceasefire of arms supply to Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967 with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside also have to push on a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make the Palestinian State more than an immediate offer to the United Nations virtual sovereign.
President Obama also has his share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he neglected the performance of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems equally irritating in its accession to the process.
It's patheticly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging came into force.
The unsighted green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, show warning for smokers and sick body parts.
The Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and the logo and color of brands replaced the general olive green boxes with gross images of sick parts of the body and the image of children and newborns sick by smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between box names of brands that are printed in the same small font is required from Saturday.
This is the world's most stringent regime for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by removing their attraction.
It depends on studies that show that if people don't smoke until 26 years old, 99% of the chance that they never smoke.
"And in very small children, you can see that it means a message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown for example that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of transnational companies, others will consider introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry, against the introduction of these laws, was very hard to lobby.
The cable companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation there will be serious inadvertent consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone used to cover gross boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
It stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale vendors and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible problem, experts show the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has prohibited online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a market worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left to promote your products, online space is an invincible place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher in the field of public health at Sydney University.
Mrs. Freeman has recorded an increase in the rating of brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is the marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector has focused on how it will impose new regulations rather than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to have paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for assaulting new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are significantly involved.
SOO Decision is expected to be adopted in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has conducted interviews with other governments that consider similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now they have spread to over 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering more stringent laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no influence on me.
I just ignore them.
"Just take a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box of cancer photos in the mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in Sydney, claims that thanks to the single box, it is harder for him to cope with the racks.
"It took me one hour to put the load out, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, let's close the shop," he said, and throw them out with our hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite distractions by books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention hollow-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with praiseful boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly attached to some screen today, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
So should we be supporting the boring?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a rather new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (The History of Nuds) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a long history boredom," he said.
Latin inscription on boredom was found on the walls of Pompey, originating in the first century of our summer.
And then it's also a question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and presenting the thoughts of the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it".
Boring from apathy differs by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would want to be.
He says there's no need to do anything with apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "distorting the process of attention associated with bad mood and feeling of slow running time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, boring people tend to see problems like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble focusing.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Definition Bored in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape that a person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups have heard the loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others have heard it so quietly that they have barely noticed it, while the third group has not heard it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quiet, reported more boring than the other two groups - had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributing these problems to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or persuasional task, it can cause a disturbance of attention to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "like finding bad parts on the factory line, it can help distracting music with you not being bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that cutting and moaning, which he often looks at as the sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more noticeable.
"The research shows that the children who are allowed to go through, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored sometimes - late on my flight, a hustling speaker, especially a long film.
But some individuals have more chance of bored than others.
For help measuring the boredom of scientists in the 1980s, they developed the "Bordom Proneness Scale".
The bra includes questions such as, "A lot of things I have to do are repeated and is monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodnovich, professor of psychology at University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
But the teenagers are generally unattractive.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times daily almost 400 teenagers and their parents contacted.
He found out that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, three percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage expression of boredom would now be 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "student is the top time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my initial question: "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addicts as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodnovich, who studied the problem for over two decades.
"Nuda is a brain way to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy for a while, not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive separately, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is passed from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain herself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical to her.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of constant crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly restimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise turns off."
There is no guide in Colorado on the new marijuana Act
The 19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and a footballer from southeastern Colorado, complains of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the country - for holding several grams of marijuana and pipe he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day he went with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After he found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a petition for possession of drugs and drug-use equipment - minor offenses with which 100 USD is for every fine - and his date of trial was set.
"They were treating us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorad vote on the legalisation of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, hundreds of smaller drug cases are more likely to respond than right.
Hundreds of crimes for possession of marijuana were already here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults at the age of 21 and older for the possession of small quantities legally authorised after the law entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in more conservative provinces, Colorado, have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and are still accusing people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the suburb of Denver towards the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed trades with marijuana in their villages.
"This matter develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are gossiping and regulators in the state of Washington.
And looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - everything until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either in good or bad, is first in front of the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the licensing board for the sale of Washington alcohol.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possessions yes.
And there are all kinds of mechanical questions that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the State Directive on "corresponding approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with cannabis up to 330 meters from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's resorts.
"There will be no more difficult place to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle metropolitan," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for legal cannabis, recently established research groups.
On 21 November Oates sent his e-mail officers from Aurora to tell them that a city prosecutor will no longer be prosecuted for possession of a small number of marijuana at every citizen who was 21 years old and that the police "with immediate effect" will stop accusing people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and that they will continue to prosecute drug shoppers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Prosecutor Ken Buck is a more strict sighting.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to investigate cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently, the charges against the holding of 56 grams or fewer marijuana 119 people are facing many other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute a criminal offence that was criminal at the time it occurred," said Buck in his statement.
The response was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the period, no longer blames adults for holding small amounts.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all pending detention cases.
"I don't think I'm losing my time in law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorad voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system would never be easy.
And anti-conflict reactions across the state have revealed with regard to this large state-owned experiment deep-separity among local officials.
For district prosecutors it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendants of possession of marijuana, and the local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still cannot accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states to become a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national tests cases for drug legalization.
Defenders and state authorities are planning a new border for legitimate sale and also anxiously await guidelines from the federal government, which is still planned to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The lawyers of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will submit.
Despite several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, who have taken note of it, the federal government has mostly left stores with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While drug agents are probably not going to blow the door to catch a small drug bag, it is likely that they are going to allow the state of regulated trades with recreational marijuana authorised by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorad cities don't expect a practice of federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium for any new marijuana business, although it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the West State proposed a six-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're going to issue a license and then we're going to have a big federal matter," Bob Nicholson, a city council member, said.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the municipality voted for, compared to what the state voted out.
There are a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Only students today are not considered their views.
I don't remember ever knowing about college in Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university that I thought was the world's largest knowledge base, a modern Greek symposium stimulating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the '80s, I was up to two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack my bags and fit into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said, in turn, that I left because I was forced to drink from the mutilated pots.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this collegiate enlightenment, it was both bigothal and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I'm an accessory to the Konzervative Party.
You can ask me why I'm bringing this up right now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students on the right side have a similar pursuit.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students was committed to the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Consumer members of the younger-year association (JCR) at the Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political opinions they are "popularly isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown to them that they are not welcome".
They ask for a position at the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that their opinions can be freely communicated.
Their situation did not help the recently mentioned documentary show BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Rights (Peace countries: young, intelligent and right-wing) about student political events, which conservatively pronounced as strange and neo-Nazi.
The show was presented by a graduate of Joe Cooke, former President of Oxford University Conservative Association (conservative association of Oxford University - OUCA), who drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other universities conservative students say that they are treated as "premises lambs" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (conservative Association of Nottingham University), said to Sunday's newspaper that "left influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us."
A 21-year-old history student at the Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the move for greater protection, says that such climate is "nervous", while a 19-year-old elected President of the OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that there has been a deterioration in the access of JCR members to the people from the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and stunning in a manner of shyness.
Hate for the Konzervative side was the worst.
A year earlier, the university voted against the award of honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher because of the cuts in the financing of higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be concerned.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students met between each other and the professors, I got a taste of the pellet that was supposed to come.
I found that not only professors of silence approve the stimuli of conservative pupils, but also they participate with their taste.
The political strike, privatisation and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wood-based audiences.
My first lecture was about translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what had been followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I've had a lot of weight.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake cake, was very gallant.
"Thatchers refuse to teach French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were moving.
I've had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic English lessons in your free time, unless you are too busy with social issues," said Professor Pitt.
I've returned to my room in a healthy way.
During dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who's a suspect in conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
The student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (a certain irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of the Fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He's beating each other, isn't he?
I felt like they had to feel gay in front of liberal legislation in the '60s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet with those people who think like that only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed like a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who served at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those writing her speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for his province and maliceness and for his affection for the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined the professor's position at the University of Bielkent at the Turkish Ankar.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' home in London, looking for refuge at my unincarcerated metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city's dream mood.
Even my Communist friends always had perfect ways.
His muddy eyes have grieved.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
The frequent trips to London were exhausted by my emotional resistance.
My friend, also a supporters of the Konzervative Party, fell under pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week during teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness declared that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the middle of a well, I confessed to being brainwashed by "parents" and called them "old fools."
Relief was only short-term.
The nail in my Oxford career's coffin beat my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I walked inside, and after five minutes my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my trunk and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a fucking weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and toxicity in the educational institute.
However, it is even more tragic that it was Oxford, not only that 14 conservative premieres came up, but also which, until today, hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Champion of Fashion" which began this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisov and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I. Anglické, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebration retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion" which represents more than 130 models of the top fashion created by his studio for the last 50 years.
"I love this lock," he says with his unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which lasts until 3 March, will be filled with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan through the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from Vogher town in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian smetres".
To love the royal family is not wrong.
"They at least make you a unspeakable piece of cigarettes into a great carpet, such as some wonderful pop-music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a generous and elegant experience.
"We were very pleased with all of us when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close girlfriend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance rather than glory.
He's still a star."
Valeria Mazz is showing Valentina
Neither does the Argentinian model Valeria Mazz forget the charisma designer.
"It's been a lot of years since we went to see him for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
It was 20 of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every smallness of his apartment, decoration, food, music, and all that, he healed and felt his spirit.
All invited people could feel important and loved," recalls the top model, which began to work with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"It never comes out of style because his designs are artistic works," he concludes.
Birthday show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsessiveness, it is a truly restored glory.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's galleries was transformed into a separate 70-metre passage offering an exchange of roles: a visitor will change into a model and marches the passages to observe the "presence" of dreams, which wears Valentin's masterpieces as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti was wearing in "Nace" or a coat of wool and fur, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience, the mannequin September of the names of Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgaria and Sophie Habsbury.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that first Valentino is like the first love, "I can't forget it."
"I remember perfectly.
It was pants, shirts, vests of "gillette" and jacket of autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designer muses.
"I give him a preference to his womanhood and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," adds the former duchess of Feria.
"I like the colors that he uses, they brighten up a lot, and they put "raise" on his face.
The props are perfect."
Not even a princess and fashion icon Patricia d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full and to have the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
Finally, she was in her late 1990 ’ s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina to celebrate the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with a call, a wooded nutrients and a top without a frame.
It was a dream that became real," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is luxurous to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has put on the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because dress isn't just clothes, it's also a set of memories that they have in them".
"The King" Fashions
The golden ridge of the exhibition in Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Pavel Greece in 1995.
In order to create these silk dresses, ivory colors with sewn pearls, twelve types of different country and a tow length of four and a half metres were needed four months of work and 25 "holes" (as called the designer of his slides).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, they represent this dress's milestone of peak fashion of the late 20th century, "return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled during the years by the elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Gravavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the order of the Honorary Legie builds up so much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always drawn to his choice, peace, adjusted and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him, I saw him at a gala at the Museum of Orsay a month ago.
He was at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my great girlfriend.
He was awesome, and time didn't leave a trace on him."
If that's what the princess says...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the area of the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, they gamble in the area of Indonesian volcanoes with their lives and health, bearing 70 kilos of sulphur down on steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earns the living of the sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Jawa.
For this reason, every day, they must go all the way to the bottom of the crater, where dark gases are avoided from the inside of the earth, and in contact with the air goes into a solid state.
After he cuts out large blocks of sulphur, which weighs up to 70 kilos together, he takes them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets on the steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but exhausted carriers lasts for over 40 minutes before they grow up to the turtle's speed up, because they maintain balance and carefully ponder their steps to avoid slipping and falling into the abysss.
They know that any stumbling could happen to them as it happened to one French tourist, who collapsed from Kawah Ijen's rock years ago.
Horners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur that earns
When they are up there, they take their way around tourists who photograph them, like they were monkeys in circus, and they're tired of taking heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company had placed by something below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi that has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then she sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyramids, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"Because you normally wear 70 kilos, we will make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every journey," Anto explains us, who usually takes three trips a day.
One journey takes three hours, and at the end it is destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it seems like an insignificant amount for so inhumane efforts, it's three times what it would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees are paid per day and pay for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a zdník.
There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6,2 euros) per day and work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto's got asthma, he's breathing badly, still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
In his 27 years, Anto three times a day riskes life in a volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to collect its tax, although my face is protected by special masks and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, always coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that are avoiding volcanoes.
That's the price they have to pay to reach their dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises more than a dignified English.
This kind and intelligent young man who has a destiny could be a tourist guide, a waiter or receptionist at a hotel, and he's doing the work of a carrier instead.
They share a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, and every day they wake up at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur at night does not cease to hang out and its characteristic yellow color is changed in blue and September by dark.
Despite the surrounding heat of Anto into the crater and illuminates the path with a small lamp that he has attached to his helmet and bought it for his money.
About 400 carriers carry on the arm of the basket with the sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Even though the company has high incomes, the mining of sulphur for cost savings did not preclude, nor does it provide carriers for their own fists and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from a photo charge, which together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro) chooses a park guard from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle and not for people," says Madrusin, a brave 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last as long as he can, because he needs money to train his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns its throat and pinches in the eyes, when the wind will unexpectedly turn and break the mines in dense fumes, which are coming out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complain that it suffers from severe diseases... however, it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wound to the arm caused by weight of baskets.
In his 53 years, an unanic who balances his basket on his back can impose more than 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his colleagues are able to carry 15 tons of sulphur in volcano, which then three stones take their way down the steep path between the swings to the warehouse in Tamansari, located 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unaik declares, opening up a wide mouth, in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns a seed of seed.
Time is running, but the persistent poverty of one of the most difficult craftsmen in the world persists from generation to generation - the crafts that carry out human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singapore reports that they do not have children, careers, stress and living and education costs.
"The people of Singapore need growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the labeling on menthol candy, but still - or maybe that's why - the video spread to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are parts of the rap, which uses the local "we put the bush in the oven" as a mixture of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH Advertising Agency, which has created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do their civil duty.
"One of the only things about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that's the subject we have to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things to expand perfume with pheromones or to organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing like Rapu's composition to solve this problem."
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends maternity leave and adds financial benefits.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in the south-east of Asia, also a well-known conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, with a view to spreading the population, is at present 1.2 a child to a woman.
The last one exceeded the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don't the Singapores have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Families of the National Pension Office, says it's because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of opportunities in terms of life goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While there were attempts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the population, the local population did so to make it worse.
On some Singapore web pages, it is seen unscrupled xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially China, who are criticized for keeping low wages and trying to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore recorded its worst electoral outcome since the beginning of independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to tackle the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to make so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence real estate business.
The City Development Authority has started to regulate the number of small apartments known as "crabies from shoes", which can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments had a space of 46 square meters and had great success in their stores.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of development company EL developers, claims that their "crabies from shoes" are sold much faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, so they'll be sold for days to weeks faster than homes with more space.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be directed towards increasing the birth rate of the nation, an interview with the Singapores working in the financial districts in the city center suggests that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore many people postpone it," says the young official.
"Other people, let them have children.
But it is important for me to rely on their own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress and cost of living and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So whatever the government's trying to force citizens to have children, they're just the last word the Singapores have about setting up their family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has personal character or "the area of private life, which everyone has the right to protect against any disruption".
What's privacy for a man under the age of 16?
How does it apply this definition in its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed when he publishes issues on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during ordinary communication?
Reporters from elPeriódico confessed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are often Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy "something entirely own" in a personal plane and "user name and password" if it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would not be published," says Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mother can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"On FB, I take nice photos or pictures of us playing.
I'm talking to my friends, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rough comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends that have on his FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
There's also a mother who has one of the accounts' name and password.
"I started my Twitter account so I could express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers to me, I'm just giving them there," she adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without delay, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown.
The 14-year-old José case is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them led him to anything, nor did he want an address or phone number.
"If they insist on me, or they demand it from me, I simply remove it from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading the Twitter recommendations.
This boy is no stranger to what is called cyberbullying today.
"Some friend on the social network was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked him for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
The victim did not report from José's account.
"Just activated the private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps, how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would be able to publish photos known in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course, I would have done it if I had someone wrong or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate of Education and Education, is convinced that children and adolescents in social networks should be properly oriented, they must understand that the main purpose of such networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogical at Yale University and author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and, on the contrary, not at the age when they are not already ruined".
Also, in order to be - in terms of the surroundings - prudent, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is is is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
In addition, Marrielos Porras calls out some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, would you like someone to publish your picture the way you published your friend?
You know what the others are making public about you?
When you indicate the person in the photos of the party, did you ask these people for permission?
And another thing: Do everyone ever need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet as well as out of the Internet.
They're the same rules.
"Man is acting out of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be on social networks," he claims.
Attention
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at first level and an education counselor explains that it is necessary that parents of children read carefully the rules of social networks.
"If he understands every delusion, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that the setting up of an account on the Internet can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule "not to talk to strangers".
The South America Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today, without a statement from Lima, which was cited and allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Presidential Offices, who initially established that the document would be published after the end of the summit, stated that it would later be published on the Peruvian Government website.
They also stated that the contents had been published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humalou in several short press declarations.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without the sound of the "confidential meeting, the transmission of the grounded sound".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided to press speakers of some governments who were present but not a Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of Presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail to the media with a 'final statement' from the summit, but it is only a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that the summit has concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and was not originally promised Declaration from Lima, although the press was horribly required.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the supply of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, the common commitment of Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court, which deals with the border dispute between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which would begin hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss the dispute that Lima had initiated against Santiago.
"We will take part and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala, together with his Chinese counterpart.
"He was, is, and will be a country respecting international law, peace settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera and greeted President Humal with a handprint on the flag of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted this week a pact this week to express its submission to the rulings of the international court which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
The Summit took place without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rousff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paragy was excluded from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernando Luga and the meeting was not attended.
The host president of Ollanta Humala was assigned to launch morning speeches and to conclude a summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted, and was planned to operate on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $117 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the Member State of UNASUR has mentioned that it will take "the important steps to target South American citizenship for which the residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions are supported to improve 'cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of drugs and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters'.
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America), but it is supposed to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to priorise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more connected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President in a read speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the cross-sectional axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not show more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its return to the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue the summit raised was the need for Latin America to continue to be a prosperous and peaceful area that is wholesome and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting, that he hopes that on Saturday in Mexico he will meet hissteries Daniel Ortego, to discuss with due respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute that is challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (on Saturday) I will meet President Daniel Ortego," said Santos.
"We will discuss all solutions, there are no exceptions, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations as civilized as possible and in the best possible form," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they will attend the inauguration of the former President Enrique Peña Nieta.
As part of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers had provisionally met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area of defence.
The UNASUUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country in question is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Today, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "the South America, in this case really, must teach from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on State TV Perú that Europeans "killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that the Member States of Unasur support.
"There is a need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still root areas that wish to return us to the past," he pointed out.
The Ecuadorese President, among other things, stated that he agreed to the regroup of the US Organisation (OAS) on condition that the influence of the English states will be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"These who lead are never bound to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the International Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," said Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish jurisprudence that asked him to question himself in the Swedish territory due to the alleged sexual delicacy, with "own Swedish legislation allowing him to carry out an interview with a video conference call that could take place from the Ecuador embassy in London".
Correa reported that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and psychological health will get worse.
"I haven't spoken to him since the embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that she has minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," the head of the state of Ecuador said.
"However, his physical and psychological condition is threatening to deteriorate because it is closed in a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa pointed out that, since June June at the Ecuadorn embassy in London on the basis of a permit that enables him to travel to Ecuador, there are talks in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Courts, and he stressed that London had been interviewed in order to resolve the arrest of the founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights issues, we do not use such a word in this case, but keep talking.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Britain gives out the pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden will listen to Mr Assange's embassy in London or Skype, as it enables them to do without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, this problem will be over tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender for freedom of the press, and to clarify that he certainly did not tolerate "the mediocreness, the bad intentions and the lie that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, mean and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in profit, pressure and extortion services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed the joy of such journalists, "not the bankers, neither the hegemony countries, nor the burjoas dominate Ecuador", and he said that if he was elected again, "he would continue to make changes in the right direction and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the included Paraguay regarding membership in the Unasur Union at least into its next elections and argued that the whole "must be strong and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučism wrapped into legality" because in fact "he destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered "a completely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgment of the International Court in Haag, which he decided in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"There's a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
They need to be assessed widely to be overcome and there is a possibility to go forward."
He also expressed the hope in the settlement of a maritime border dispute in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instance, if both countries commit themselves to accept a judgment, whatever it will be hard".
In connection with the possibility that he would run for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to pursue the third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses election in February 2013, he will leave the public life.
"I have never personally cared for power, but such an unfair situation as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be managed by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, the same thing is waiting for me.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Madur, who says that President Chávez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It is not a review in the health condition of the President," he explained.
The Head of the Ecuador State today attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are a consequence of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning hit me," he said when he remembered the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slighten", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his sickness alone on his own bed, and he started to get informed about it, and with such commitment, he'd already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG) that came to in 1994 after several diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years, which has been something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and bigger stigma.
At that time neither the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said, "because he had a cut wound."
That's when AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live fully with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their illness and come when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, who confirmed this information in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that from 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and full life depend on the degree of disability of patients diagnosed with the immune system, better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "with respect for treatment to live without problems up to 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
It is appropriate to stress this progress that the average life span of Mexicans is 76 years now.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS died from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Common Programme for HIV/AIDS – UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered.
Only in the state of Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from illness?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the options to access treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted the drug supply, and the problem is that patients are coming in at a very advanced stage because they don't know the disease status or at the late stage of the disease."
It adds a convincing indication: "The nine of the ten patients are coming when some associated infection is being shown. All we need to do is to make more impact on the overall mortality, it is necessary to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer tests to find the disease for all those who ask for it".
In his proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco also directly with patients such as Fabrizio who came to take tests into a private lab only because he did this to his friend, and despite his low age, he had already suffered from AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a tumor disease, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna hang out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, lead an active sex life, but responsiblely, I look out for myself and the other person," mentions Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid today on World AIDS Day.
If they risk, let them know if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarises the password of the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health and common citizens programmes, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalair journalist who finds out information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are prevention.
In the places devoted to this task "to the truly increased distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but still there are people who do not have access to condoms", he said.
Teens are among the most vulnerable to new diseases.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school advisers, drug workers and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested to change this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not just the counters, but the hundred, which are in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not the promotion of promiscuity.
It's not even about paying them beer and motels, as Governor Emilio González responded to asking if he would agree to split the condoms during his period.
It is not like that, it is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sexual life," he noted.
Key Numbers in the State of Jalisco
13 435 cases were reported (12 158 AIDS cases and 1 317 HIV cases).
This condition means fourth place in Mexico in new and established AIDS cases and 13. place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease is on a sexual basis 6% of the blood route by 2% on a permanent basis.
It is estimated that some 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, because there are four to five people who don't know about disease.
The judgment approved by the appeal court of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of Groupo Vitro, as established by an audition in Mexico, raises an unfamiliar precedent for any national undertaking with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It appears, therefore, that the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws, the country of lanes and stars, despite international agreements, do not apply.
The approval of the judgment delivered on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Hal at the audition court for North Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscated their assets on the second bank of the el Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens up the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the Supreme Court of the United States with a appeal against the three irregularities.
In the introduction, it should be said that while judges of this case claim that creditors are to follow the US insolvency law, the fifth district appeal court, based in New Orleans, states that the main procedure sets out bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of transnational insolvency.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law was established to unite international trade law, which is determined by the arbitration team by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting a branch from the internal corporate structure, where the debt of Vitro’s parent company to its branches is recognised, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not be obtained.
However, this possibility of Mexican laws admits.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose intra-terranean debts the Federal audition institute has ruled.
In addition, it is true that even after subtracting the votes, creditors - who stood against Vitro in a court in the United States, i.e. funds of "supas", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached most.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
That indication of the appeal is not considered by the court.
From another point of view, the court blame Vitro for the difficult situation she faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, González Sada’s family company will make an appeal for a new assessment directly at the appeal court, so that the assessment will take place in full participation, i.e. with the participation of five Judges, because they originally voted only three.
If he fails to succeed here, he will demand a higher instance review of the process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious that the court has left behind a documentary sent by the Mexican Government as a department of amicus curiae, which describes the practice of Vitro in the framework of the insolvency law and points out that the company has made itself easier by inclined towards agreements signed by both countries to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insoleční act.
In addition, it points out that the country has subordinated itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for international insolvency cases which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall evaluation
Without notice, she had been on the table for several months a criminal announcement of Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of Gastón Azcárrag Andrad, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, and according to the department organization of pilots, the vessel has already escaped.
Instance led by Carlos Díaze Chávez Morineau just brought an action against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, accused of obstruction of justice.
According to the audit authority, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Federal Prosecutor General on the transaction carried out by that trader in which it selected 198 million pesos from the bank IXE of F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The means were probably directed to purchase shares Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarratra Andrade is the major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dressing Dragon Martu
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens, who approved the establishment of an association, met on the weekend.
We speak, as we know, about the huge trade and distribution center with products from the "morning with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and Caribbean, which in the lower part would involve the residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has previously managed to unite the governors of the southeast zone to face a monumental area that would in part expose the protected area and which is the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of matter with ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into consideration and requested an explanation of the conditions under which the Mexican Ambassador to the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting was signed in Japan, known under the English shortcut ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Proped Industrial) has expired.
As has been known, it has been so, despite the fact that the Senate itself has voted out the possibility to consider it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term debts and not to influence these short-terms, Homex has put investment certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer payment of interest every 28 days.
He's born Competival
The association of leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was born by an association with the trade name Competival, which would aim to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business is going to exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basetbal was my life"
The Basketball Satellite "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for over 60 years and has been processing the whole world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a lot of memories of the history of local basketball, like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was released in 2008 by the brain stroke on a wheelchair, lit into this sport for over 60 years, whether as a younger player, player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rico basketball Federation.
"I held a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several at the same time as when I was president of the National League BSN, the General Manager of the National Team and the Chairman of the Federation," Reyes remembered his faithful wife at his home in Primer Hora, Bayamon, where he lived for over 50 years with Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenirs from his long career, testify to that.
Bayamón in heart
He has been the player since the mid-50s, where he was up until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best summer, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the team of Vaqueros since 1967, either as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
The team then took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here and that time worked at the Alabama University of Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Marcy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me a player named Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon a win for the championship, Gausse will then contribute to the next."
The Championship, when Gausse played for the team, he enjoyed it, but only remotely, because in 1988 he had already performed the President of the basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and to take up Marcy's location on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world championship in 1990, where we ended up fourth, but we should have had a bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final entry," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at Olympics in 2004.
But my favourite was the national team in the Panamerian Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we blew out the United States Manship that was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze out on the world championship.
It had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, Leon brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quiote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
The manhood, which may not have been the perfect composition, but we were able to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the manhood of the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentinian Neuquén.
With players on the list, like they were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players voted out because of the struggle in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without any doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his actions in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belonged to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from young people.
Which of your success in the Federation would you consider to be the greatest?
That I was a part of the most famous era of national estate between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s, I had a National League of BSN in one season up to 17 males.
What didn't you have to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island in only national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, arbitration assistants and referee.
Nice to meet you.
What are you now devoted to?
I most listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, served world-class roles as John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he embroiled a man who acted carelessly and was eloquent and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewinga's predatory magnate in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of lactose in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died on the official notification of the family that the Associated Press agency provided to Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon, to complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died in the Dalla hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
It gave joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, kind, and talented, and he would miss me so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman diagnosed the hepatic circulation in 1992, and he himself admitted that he drank a lot for years.
In 1995, a fatal tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman was transplanted.
Years before the broadcast of Dallas, Hagman was famous for being a decent guy on TV in a relaxed comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcasting station NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comics, which were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Against (ABC, 1973).
His action in the films involved roles that were well received by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R., which led him to the starboard.
The drama series of CBS stations on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The provocative slogan "Who shot Jajár?", which was supposed to trigger expectations about the work of the full emotion, when Hangman's figure was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of audience speculations worldwide, but also a million dollars risking at bet offices.
This also helped to get a record in proportion.
On average, 41 million TV viewers followed the November 1980 episode, and Dallas became the second most common entertainment show of history after the end of the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, followed by 50 million viewers.
J.R. fired his sister-in-law Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played an Ewinga, an unsatisfying greed with a charismatic smile: a hearty businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked into a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on gravestones," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies an honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the canvas and outside."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series of Dallas were broadcast by TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"It was finished shooting five parts of the second row and the sixth just turned," she informed the TV station.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner, nor from the TNT station on how the series would continue.
The family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of actresses and singer Mary Martinová, who performed in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931, she had Larry, whose father was her husband, a lawyer named Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 1950 ’ s, Larry tried his luck at theater scenes in New York City and then served in England from 1952 to 1956.
That's where he met Young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, who was married.
The marriage couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in Malibu, California, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001 he published an autobiography book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could harm anyone or harm him," said Prens Asocida that day.
After liver transplant he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, where he helped combat patients.
"I advise them, deliver courage, meet with them when they go to surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
It starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week students examine apocalypse themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Stuart Charmé decided to make this semester a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the 'long number' of May calendars to come on December 21st, many people were caught as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for in the next few months: the Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the "long Armageddon" and the growing conflict into which Israel is dragged, a place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic term ever," said Charmé this week to the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When a person discusses what happens today in the world, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad is for apocalyptically thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
The University of Temple holds an expert assistant Barry Vacker a course "Producers, culture and the end of the world".
Every week students examine apocalypse themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We consider why these thoughts expand with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students are studying movies with apocalypse themes and looking at how different they are from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Resall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant of art history and anthropology, began to organize a course with the simple name End of the world.
"We do not connect "2012" because we always expect the possibility to arrange the course again if the world does not end," Restall said.
Despite the threat of destruction, students must study, create projects and do final exams.
Penn State will take the final exam on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the evening of the anticipated end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He grew up in two hours," Restal said about his course for high-diagnosis students, which he applied to 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester we received an e-mail asking if there was room.
The students themselves make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Rutgers University at Camden 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student in the field of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
Therefore, apocalypse, worldly or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology student, and nursing, said he saw all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it might be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no dared student, let alone professor, didn't say he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
"Our first project discussed mayan prediction and in some way we will throw it away," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University of West Chester.
"May never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalypse anxiety, which goes back a few centuries ago, which people react to changes in their surroundings with forecasts about the end of the world.
The expansion of these speculations caused the internet.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
It is so happening in the absolutely most in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is doing this year in the Philippines, asked if he knew about a course about the "end of the world", answered quickly.
"Filipins do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception at the highest office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
He noted that during the years there was talk of many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or propose that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
A few said they intend to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I'll call some friends to laugh together," explains Samir Ford's 20-year-old communications student.
