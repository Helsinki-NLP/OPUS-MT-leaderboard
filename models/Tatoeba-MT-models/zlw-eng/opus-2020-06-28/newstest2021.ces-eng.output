The well-secreted Cave of the Desert in the woods near New Bora was not in fact resident
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Czech Republic, there are several sandstone rock formations in the woods leading the County Way.
Natural and artificial.
And we will follow the human hands created.
The town's called Cave of the Desert.
In fact, there was never a deserter, and the caves served as a hideout, more precisely a hideout chamber apparently on grain.
The cave is carved from side to side of rock sharpness and accessible by stairs from above.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last moment.
It will be revealed through the narrow stairs leading to some sort of rock gallery where it will only enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is very far from the human dwellings, at the time of creation it could have been on the top platform, where there is today a forest, a field.
"The fact that this object has no window and not even on a traditional site located topeniště, clearly shows that no deserter could have ever survived the winter here," explains the historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single space object in the back has only a stone bench serving apparently to postpone the container.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," she adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of instruments on the cave walls.
The sanding of sandstone was a top for the dedicated quite simple and fast.
It was enough to use clutches and sandstone appropriately to break down gradually.
According to the length of the foot at the top and in any way the cutting can be defined in the frame of formation of the cave.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, sometimes during these days, someone sleeps sometimes.
If you approach a cave from one of the forest trails and take you under the caves flowing streams and the nearby Counting Route, you will certainly find the path down also.
And by the way of the forest, you may still be captured by the nearby Havran Rocks.
Žocka Minařík is after a heavy fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Filip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is in similar cases, moreover, we have a family part in Hannover.
This makes my situation significantly easier and also care for Finju's daughter," quoted the Jezdci.cz server of Minaříkov's wife, Katji.
"Everyone's doing maximum, Filip needs time to reconvalescence.
There's no point in giving prognosis.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of trauma to the heads and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip's a big fighter.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said the woman, 45-year-old jockey.

The video decider took four goals to the Sassola football players, lost 0:2
The Sassola football players, though in the Saturday match in Naples, got four times the ball into the opponent's goal, but eventually they had to accept the defeat 0:2.
Not one of their goals adjudicated after consulting the video for an offensive.
According to the Italian media, it's a record lack of technology, so many interventions have never been destroyed by the VAR team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him as yet no team.
New technology breaks record," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport.
"Festival of the unknown goals of Sassuola.
VAR was never so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday in 8 minutes, but after half an hour of the game, Sassuolo seemed to be on balance.
But the goal of Filip Djurič was not recognized after the action of the video-determined because of the offensive.
For the same reason, they did not gradually pay any other Djurician intervention and Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the other hand, the home has added one more goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic there was most in history
"The growth has drawn both a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend in more frequent charging at public stations, as well as an accelerated development of registrations of new e-aut," said CEZ Chmelek, head of clean technologies.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the Tesla electric motor manufacturer, are also reported on the market, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets.
The operators of the classical pumping stations are again representing MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our electromobility network last year," explained Jan Jusková.
Redakce Deník, however, exclusively gained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
It shows that the drivers from the stations took 13.5 kWh on average.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric vehicle.
If we forget to draw up to 1 kWh, it takes an average charge of two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then ran in free tariff.
If the motorists already paid for the collection, their typical loss of around 330 crowns was.
Electromobility extends mainly in the capital.
The territory of Prague is located all five of ČEZ's most extensive suppliers, which also houses the whole town.
The regions are then led by Olomouc.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is in a remote station in the border, such as Bohumín or Prachitice, which often lasts all day without any use.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
Only this first half of the year came 1274 new e-aut.
In the extensive survey, "Češ in motion" said eight percent of readers that the purchase of an electromobile into the family was considered.
Only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government’s previous steps are on protection and healing of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis insufficient, speakers have called on the state to approach more effectively.
The event entitled Last drop was attended by representatives of major organizations such as Duha Movement, Greenpeace or Green Page, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have, for example, people who have been performing long-term counter-expansion at the bottom of the Turks, there are people who stand up against the pupolage of the Uherské Ostroh, who are facing the construction of pointless dams," said Marika Volfová.
It has shown that the main demands of protesters are the establishment of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a significant change in agricultural policy and a subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not a careless and devastating business," she said.
In Malostranské náměstí, a petition was placed with representatives of the Czech state to determine the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech land and landscape.
The present people were equipped with banners with passwords like "The End of the fluffy fluffy" or "A mine of coal, more lentils".
From southern Moravia to Prague Jan Škoda came from the association For water to the people who protested against the plan of mining plunging in Hodoninsk.
"He threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that drills represent the fifth most valuable source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned fir mining is only about 500 metres from the wells, and according to the conclusions, it is certain that water quality will be at risk.
For so-called agri-environmental farmers he arrived from Valeč village in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He pointed out that they were not being married for income and profit and supply the residents directly on site.
"The small agri-environmental farms are quite capable of feeding the entire population, on top of it they do not make such a ruin on the form of rural and environment," he said.
Three people died when the plane crashed on the house in Germany
Three people died today in the fall of an ultralight plane to the apartment house in West Germany, and the other two were injured.
They reported this to the local rescue staff, which indicates that there are probably two crew members among the dead and one resident of the house.

The fires have already managed to get under control.
Deputy local fire chief Robert Meyboom has reported that both members of the plane died apparently.
The third victim says there's a woman living in the house.
Denik Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote with a appeal to Mayor Wesel that it was a mother of a solitude whose two-year-old daughter was saved from the apartment with light injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake in the landing.
The police believe it came from a crash plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Denik Rheinische Post, referring to eyewitnesses, said that before the crash, the plane hit a hot-air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with appeal to other witnesses, wrote that the aeroplane fell into the air before the impact on the earth.
The Czech savings office miscounted some payments twice on Saturday.
_Other Organiser
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech savings office miscounted some payments twice by the card.
According to the spokesperson of Lukáš Kropiek, the problem may have been related to thousands of transactions.
The run-in has already been removed and the money has returned to the clients.
The problems with double charge of card payments were successful on Saturday afternoon.
"Even yesterday (on Saturday) on the night, we updated the system and returned all these double payments to clients immediately.
At this moment everything works fine," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the Bank has deducted from card payments twice, the spokesperson of the bank, according to its estimate, was less than thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problem is determined.
"It could be a combination of more factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million of them.
The savings owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.

On the map, there will also be individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation is not uniform," Vojtěch said.

The majority disease is mild, only three percent in the hospital infected
Either the Czech Republic spreads a milder form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun greatly improved immunity.
The hospital's infectious division is semi-empty, even though the numbers of infected are growing.
"This situation today and April is completely different, and it is mainly given to the number of hospitalised people," says Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding that on April 11th, when the first wave of epidemics came to us, all the rings were carried out by the army, the Republic was closed, and the Czechs were using disinfections for the year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now, daily increases in the number of infected higher, but every day with covid-19 are dying up to two people.
The highest number of people infected for the population still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to fire in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the seniors was closed by the hygiene department in Montenegro at Royalhradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests with one of the nurses.
"We've narrowed our movements, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schaniel, the director of the pensioner's home.
According to him, none of the clients at home have symptoms of illness yet.
The written testing will begin by tomorrow, and then they will decide on further measures.
Hospitals also respond to an increase in the number of infected.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a ring when they enter.
Record reports from South Bohemian hygiene, who recorded 25 cases of Coronavir - most of them constitute foreign employees of a pupatic company.
Overall, 131 infected people arrived on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less tested on weekends.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson smetl
Great surprise tournaments named Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated excellent performance even in combat with a player who won the second most prestigious PDC business in 2018.
The launch of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at 8:7 for Belgian arrows.
Van Day Bergh took his car with a 13-piece leg, and he's been on top ever since.
His rivals were literally crushing their game and significantly more experienced "Following Scots" just hard to get to the doubles.
The way he had it, "The Dreamer" in his pride, also suggests that the angry Anderson played his first maximum up to 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian made excellent high checkups.
Last time he was losing in his 11th leg, in a negative state, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
The arrows were just throwing, and his opponent, behind the triumph, was completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of the three mats of donations to his name - he wrote his great dream.
Zip trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for Belgian arrows that it is his first won major.
The last player who managed to beat Van den Bergha continues to be Karel Sedlaček.
In Nantes the charges for the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed.
St. Peter's Cathedral and Paul started burning in the heart of Nantes last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original view windows of the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspicion of arson was examined by investigators because the fire progressed through temples from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no evidence of violence in the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer in the local diocese, a nine - year - old Rwanda refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without even initiating prosecution.
Now the D.A. has informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced a charge of arson.
In case he's found guilty, he's threatened to be in prison for up to ten years and a fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decides to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojte: On Monday we will introduce "selafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to act as a pandemic plan, due to which the absence of government and the Ministry of Health is critical.
"The power of community dissemination will be determined," explained the Minister.
He added that, for example, Moravskoslezský kraj or Praha would now reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in each region differs significantly, it added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (OZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be attached to individual levels, whether it is a requirement to carry hand or to organise special departments in hospitals.
In order to establish an epidemiological plan on TV Prima Parte called on the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to which people should have clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized cases remains low.
The soldier commented on the fact that nothing major was happening is not the place to talk about the announcement of a state of emergency or the reintroduction of the crisis staff.
With regard to the growing number of people infected from Saturdays throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced an obligation to carry hands on internal events of over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced to 500 people, now equals 1,000 people.
The government procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they began to apply nor when they were announced, has reached criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create a sense of certainty on the contrary and compare this confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer.
The measures can now vary according to the region, for example in Prague, there is an obligation to wear handrails from Sundays in non-sovereign medical facilities, for example in pharmacists or in waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear handles when visiting medical and social facilities or medicinal products has also been introduced in Liberec and Ústecký Region since Friday.
In Vysočina in Jihlava, you must wear handles in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been released, as in the Mediterranean region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also approved the so-called Europe-wide seminar, which colourfully distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low-risk and medium-risk countries, since June 15, the Czech citizens do not require a negative test or do not require quarantine.
These are compulsory when the Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.
The technpart in Benešov continues.
She plays at a third capacity, she ends at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty u Hlaváčkova Lhoty na Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.

Music production is still partly ongoing.
We expect it to gradually come to decommissioning and disassembling music systems," Novaková said.
"Policians are still closely checking away visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers in the field, there are foreign police, traffic and order police, and in the emergency room are also dogs with servants.
"In today, police officers checked 470 people moving at the place of action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath test, of which six burners under the influence of alcohol," said Novaková.
A total of 95 police drivers tested for the presence of smokers and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also addressed 14 shifts in transport.
At the request of the participants, police officers performed 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of hallucinations and psychotropic substances.
There were, like, 2,000 people on Saturday mornings.
If the number of participants hadn't fallen, the police would have hit them.
On TV TV Prima Party, said Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor did the health care centre or Ministry apply for it.
On Sunday, the Czech Television (ČT) stated that the technopartes had spread to the surrounding lands, whose owners disagreed with the use of technopartes.
It is possible that owners of surrounding plots will request compensation.
The tech users on the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Police originally watched the meadow in Blaži on Friday in Benesov, where the technpart was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometres from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technators eventually went.
According to New York, no one came to Blaži.
The baby ended up in the hospital!

The year 2010, which the parents delivered themselves to the rescue service base, she said to Deník, the regional spokesperson of Mária Svobodová, and that the child was transferred to the hospital in Klatov.
Zmije is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and these animals occur in higher numbers on walkings is therefore good to pay attention.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance that you get away with it is not too high, in ordinary contact they are afraid of themselves.
And if she's got room for it, she likes to go away for her loud syllabus.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example when you step on it by mistake.
There is no tragedy, though her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if you have a particularly weakened organism or suffer from allergies.
The risk is therefore mainly in children, seniors, and allergies.
"A man has a feeling of vomiting, sweats, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and especially allergics can occur to anaphylactic shock," she described for Denik Miriam Gredová of Klatovová hospital.

Sixteen-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, but the career is not about to end.
He plans to return to his courts next year and believes that his family and daughter will enjoy tennis more than ever.

Sapa rice: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles arriving at the premises carried 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the Asanization Company," said the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller had no proof of origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary perspective in the long term.
Last fall, for example, vets discovered an illegal food store last year, almost half a tonne of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
In most cases, it was not possible to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had passed the period of durability and were broken.
For five kilograms of Sepia, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with police officers were detained at the market site of 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, and part of which was flammable.
Putin phoned the Zeleński before the ceasefire in Donbas, Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyre Zeielski on the situation in Donbass from midnight to start paying for a new ceasefire.
Putin, according to Kremlin's statement, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections; Kiev informed that the Greens had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
At the new peace of arms, Ukraine and Russia negotiated on Wednesday evening with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The measure is to start after midnight at Monday, it is to be "full and general" and open the way to meet other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin, in an interview with the Green Parliament, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections contradicts the peace agreement with Minsk and threatens the prospects for settlement of the conflict in the East of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the ongoing elections to local representativeship would not take place in the territory of the Dutch rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will recover under control the border of Ukrainian land occupied by separatists with Russia after it provides a wide autonomy to these regions and will hold local elections.
According to the Union agency, the Green Office has stated that both states have agreed on the benefit of the coming ceasefire in Donbas and the need to take further measures to promote peace in this region, such as the delimitation of combat areas or the withdrawal of some of the units from the front.
He also invited Putina to release the Ukrainians kept in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and Russia itself.
But on both sides of the front, people are still dying.
The conflict in Donbass from spring 2014 has asked for more than 14,000 dead.
Ukraine and the West are accusing Russia of military support for separatists, which is denied by Moscow.
Zelesky has made his priority from the end of the war in Donbas, but has not yet been a major breakthrough.

Another medal was won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, he reminded Adam Helcelet and Jiří Sýkory of the absence.
"The harm that the boys weren't here and the Kope didn't start because that would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I appreciate the fact that I had a person at 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the bar, and most likely I was disappointed by the disk, there I was below average," he said.
The first day of the 7-bomb won with more than a hundred-point advantage of Kateřina Cachová, although she was hit by an injured ankle on a retro-reflective leg.
However, in the long-distance sector, she wrote only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters in the spear, and did not enter the final eight.
She collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvorák.
She came mainly distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
Yesterday I started to pull a doll, but I am so glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't interfere with me at all," Novotná said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising ecological operation
Fuel gas, abbreviated by LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or fuel, with significantly lower excise duties, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and naphtha, it has also its ecologically clean variant - "bio LPG".
But it is all new - the European market first appeared before and to the Czech Republic according to the press release of the Czech LPG association arrived a few days ago.
"These days we received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in combination with the classic fossil LPG," reports Jiří Karlík's association from Primagas.
However, LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, the chemical side is consistent with the classic petroleum LPG, which tankes a number of motorists now in its cars.
That's why both versions can be mixed up.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the production method," says the Bio LPG Ivan Indáček, chairman of the association.
This also tells one of the major advantages of bio LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and maintain, as well as distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar cane.
In the future it should also be produced targeted, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, the conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly separation in the production of natural gas.
Thus, depending on the manufacturing technology and the CO2 operating sources on the bio LPG by 40%-70% more environmentally friendly from a carbon point of view than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it's not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, it's about the environment of fuel production, i.e., part of "well-to-tank" (the Czech "from the source to the tank").
Among the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently include petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is examining the possibility of production in its Lithuanian Refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, some 170 000 vehicles are running on LPG; the Ministry of Environment lists a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, almost 6,000 cars were carried out last year for LPG drive.
In the Czech Republic, LPG is available for approximately 950 stations of various operators.
Soldiers revised the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to correct the numbers infected by the Coronavir virus.
New statistics have been published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
On Sunday afternoon, the number fell from the Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less infected by 1775.
So now 3422 patients in the Czech Republic are now ill.
"For the jump increase in numbers treated is a revision of data that has not been updated recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of medical statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected in the Czech Republic, 11 419 were healed, and 371 Covid-19 patients were sad.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence choices.
Political and Sociologist were looking for variants for pandemic time
In order for people to vote in quarantine because of the Crown, according to Vice Prime Minister and Home Minister Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD), to vote in October Regional and Senate elections, it is necessary to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He introduced it on Sundays at the Prima Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"If we do anything, it will have to change the electoral law," Hamáček said.
A senate in the middle called on the government to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their medical condition.
The prohibition should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, on the OVM agenda, stated that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the House, then counts with its introduction for votes abroad but not in the Czech Republic.
He also considers the concerns of the ANO or the ČSSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overvalued.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that there is now a need for ad hoc mechanisms (chosen), which could be done this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main one is to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondent choice (in only foreign or Czech) considers it one of the functional methods.
As another one, he sees the election unit already mentioned or, if necessary, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how to do similar situations - the elections at the time of the Coronavirus - were dealt in Croatia, Poland or France.
Different types of elections have been postponed this year in 67 countries due to the spread of the Coronavirus disease.
Protests in Buharsk: Pigs' ears were throwing protesters at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojek Borisov and his cabinet were throwing pigs' ears at the building of the government.
It was another series of protests against the "Mafian Style of Rule," which took place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers plan on the center of the national block, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day following the radio station Free Europe/Rádio Svoboda, had a weaker participation than the previous one.
About 300 people met at 8:00, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrations in front of the government were a theatre scene, where they symbolically closed into Prime Minister Boris' prison cell as well as Attorney General Ivan Gesev in connection with the arrest of two consultants by President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignations of both belong to the basic demands of protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption during construction on the Black Sea Coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolai Hadjigenov said today in public law that the centre is about to prepare "the upper escalation" in the form of "the national manifesto in Sofia and the block across the country".
He repeated the request to withdraw Boris and his government, as well as to write off early elections.
Those good ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had already said it was wrong to resign.
This was justified, inter alia, by the need to implement Bulgaria’s pandemic of the covid-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, so that the retreat of the protestors did not calm down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government has put an end to Parliament's vote on Parliament's trust.
Coach Bologna Mihailovič doesn't want games without viewers anymore
The football coach of the Bologna Siniš Mihailovič has had enough matches of the Italian league without viewers.
The Serbian coach hopes that she will return from the new season to the stadium.
"What we're running here right now is not a football.
I'm sick of fighting without viewers.
It's unspeakable football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
The matches are worse than training.
It is horrible to play like this, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovich before tonight's fight against Lecca.
After the Coronavirus pause, they follow the matches of Syria and in a rapid sequence, and although they play until the evening, their players are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, they won't even know how the teams are.
This season is already over.
These measures had to take part in the competition, but I hope the fans will be back from September," said the coach who led Fiorentin or AC Milan in the past.
This season is unusual for Miyvlovich, even because four months on the bench was missing due to the treatment of leukemia.
"In spite of my illness, the breakup of the league, and everything else, our team managed to move to a level higher.
We want to continue to grow, and to do so we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack of foreign states, says Iran.
Since the end of June, many Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses have been reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian officials said that a fire that broke into Natanz's underground nuclear traffic this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The reason for many other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry of Iran, Abus Musáv, according to the Iranian media, said that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic daily faces "thousands of cyber attacks".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be able to bounce away.
In recent months, several wider cyber attacks have been recorded according to Musavia, followed by the analysis of which the "determined governments and groups" stood.
However, closer details of possible perpetrators were not given according to Reuters.
He also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
The article by IRNA of Iranian State Agency discussed this month that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the US, could have stood up as recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries were charged directly with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian military students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and 444 days held hostage by 52 Americans.
Long-term tight relations between the two countries rose up in 2018 after Washington resigned the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. Army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejming and a member of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdí Muhammad.
On January 8, Iran fired on the base of Iraq, where the Americans operate, a number of missiles.
The US has admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of an international nuclear agreement with Iran from 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb that Iran denies.
TPCA's car extended its production stop, now by 25 May
Cologne car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has relonged the production break due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, 25 May morning.
The tour was accompanied by dozens of sanitary measures, said the spokesperson of the car Tomáš Parubek.
Production costs due to the koravir pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday, 18 May.
The reason for extending the break is that Paroubka has closed borders and closed dealers, so there is no one to sell cars.
Paroubka says the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. two shifts.
The key markets of the company, such as Italy, United Kingdom or Spain, are affected by Koronavir.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (change for Kolín) said that the sale of production in TPCA was not signed for life in the city.
"From the beginning, it was empty in town.
But the streets are gradually filling, especially now that Monday, when things got a lot easier.
So the city is full," said Kashpar.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"In the past two months, we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Kashpar said.
As a result of the crisis, young Boleslavski Škoda Auto, which also interrupted the production, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works at 100 percent of the capacity.
The renewal of production in Skoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday on Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasinách after the restoration of production.
In TPCA there are currently about 2500 people, and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic as well as employers in Kolínsk.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: Leave a message to the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson's cancer fought, and when cancer seemed to have defeated, the disease got back together.
Nineteen-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a bed in a hospice where she was still able to take her life's love.
I'm afraid the disease has come to pass.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social network account.
Gemma Sisson, who came from English Leeds, loved her bodybuilding.
With a friend of Ricky Moore, with whom she lived more than 16 years, they traveled around the world after competitions.
Nineteen-year-old female was sporting and living healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started grueling treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The cultural and personal trainer, according to the information of the British Daily Mirror, has undergone a ten-hour operation of the spine and then re-started with drastic treatment.
Everything was in vain, of course.
At the beginning of this year, at her ninth birthday, the doctors told her she had a few months left.
In April, a handsome blonde decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged her wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage took two months.
Ricky took Gemma for her last two months' anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Only a few hours after her death, her social network account showed a contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky, who was by my side all the time and gave me a tremendous amount of love and support during the terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers," she wrote with the fact that everyone should value their lives and live it in full.
Art automation sells sweat dating, amulets of mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns he will receive a pass-by work usually beginning by Czech artists.
Images and other works create directly for the artist, so they know that they must enter the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimetres.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then a work alone," said Petr Widžová project curator.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
So the buyer can be surprised at what work he gets.
Currently, it can become a new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Štopla or by mini-view from Terezy Bonaventur, which can also be sent.
Umělec Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutch, prepared a pexeo associated with the walk of Prague.
The cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Julia Chomová sell pocket packaging of spirituality: the first of the artist offers protective amulet from the troud and wicker cards, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic book.
Health pay will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
The Greater Increase is unreal according to Vojtěch
The health pay in the next year could rise by no more than five percent, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravice's Questions on Czech Television.
The range of experts required to increase by up to 15 percent is considered irrelevant.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sustainable in providing protective devices.
The hospital says they now have supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the Minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation when, since March, it has affected the choice of insurance pandemic of the Coronavirus and government regulation against its spread.
Insurance companies' income was down at that time.
"I feel an increase of 15 percent at this moment unreal," said Vojtěch.
The average monthly medical income in acute bed care according to the date of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (OZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, Sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of the sister in the state hospitals and the wages of other organizers will be up to 7 thousand crowns.
It also shows that the drop in health nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns according to Czech Statistical Office data in 2019.
Expert representatives have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between medical income and sisters in state hospitals, which must be governed by pay tables, and contractual wages in hospitals, regions or privates.
They therefore also require that medical fees be uniform.
In health sisters this year, the difference will reach up to 7 thousand crowns a month.
For example, doctors grew faster than wages last year.
According to President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucker, experts should be aware of the state of this.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit of CZK 500 billion due to the impact of the covid epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is due to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Care Providers, according to Šmucker, disagrees with the full raising of wages in the next year.
According to him, hospital and health facilities should be decided for remuneration and should also be paid in advance of the remuneration decree.
He also stated that the hospitals currently have a lot of protective aid.
Chairman of the Administration of State Resources Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have one protective medical aid.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were purchased.
He believes that the state should try to be but also as self-sufficiency and shopping from Czech firms as well.
Their clever quarantine could take over soldiers.
We're ready to report.
"The smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss this tonight with the Army.
The army works perfectly, and the question is whether they should not drive the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook show, hey, people.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the prime minister in Moravian-Silesian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, for ČTK, stated that information on Sundays does not have and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The project's smart quarantine took over the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by the 1990s central management team set up under the military as a government advisory body led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
Mr Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized their Home Minister on Sunday.
He also said that he could be taken again by an army.
The failures in the project had previously been admitted by the government authority for IT and digitisation to Vladimir Dzirill, who is in charge of him.
"The system works, but it's still working on it.
Twenty years ago, it was created alone and nonsystemically, and now we're trying to unify it within a few months.
It doesn't go with a jet.
The people behind the march, the poor on the hygiene behind the march adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
The Ostravian Mayor Macura will not run again, because he doesn't want to "stupid in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the desire to "do not go unhindered in politics," said the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In municipal elections in 2018, the candidate led by the ANO movement in Ostrava received almost a third of electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
"I thought I'd stick to one term of office and with the experience of business I could turn everything over and on my feet," Respekt said.
He added that for the second parliamentary term, he had to speak to some extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to be stupid about politics," Macura added, which in the interview calls himself a heavy introvert, which does not suit frequent contact with people.
According to the Respekt, for a long time there has been speculation about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The Server recalls that Macura has several times criticized the ANO movement, such as the partnership with moving the SPD or the support of Milosze Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personality of Ano, he supported against Jiří Drahos in the elections of Zeman.
From the ANO movement he entered in 2017 Macura did not plan to leave.
"I will feel that in the movement I can change something that this is not a completely futile fight and that no one has in it, I have no immediate motive to go," the Respekt said.
Six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming the Ostrava Mayor in 2014, Macura acted, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company manufacturer Walmark.
He also sat in other companies' organs.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno by the end of July.
It is a consequence of the amendment of the law, stated on Thursday in the press release of Council of Brno for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Against Uber in Brno, they protested taxi drivers, pointing out that Uber did not meet conditions such as taxi or taximeter markings.
However, as of July July, the conditions for operating normal taxis and alternative ones have changed.
In recent weeks, the Kratochvil has held several meetings with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is a consequence of the amendment of the law, which allows the company to legally operate its activities.
The city has been familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services at the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
He was tested by taxi drivers for not marking vehicles like taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued preliminary measures that prohibited Uber from riding in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi driver, last year but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would like to take steps to make the Uber work in Brno.
According to later decisions, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He'll be back now on the basis of a change of law.
From July, it is easy to operate transport service ordered and paid exclusively over mobile applications, next to the classic taxi with light and taxometer.
Exhilarating party in Brno: The flying chair came from a man on the sidewalk.
From the fourth floor of the apartment, she flew out on Saturday night in Brno, office chairs and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
That's when the walker went and called the officers immediately.
The patrol immediately upon arrival at the indicated address in the western part of the town noticed an open window, under which there were still chairs and several cans and pads next to it.
"The movement that took place from the room in the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather loud party going on inside.
The officers went out to the corridor to the apartment and asked three young men present from the age of six to ninety years for explanation," said James Ghan, spokesperson.
Rafaj will address Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans on Monday with the coalition social democrats to discuss the request to appeal the Head of the Anti-Monopoly Office (OOHS) of Petra Rafaj.
In order to appeal, Rafaje invited non-profit organisations to negotiate the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as the Ustecky Region.
Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to ČTK Ralai, he was not invited to the Government Office for Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, and under the law it cannot be appointed the third time.
His appeal is in the capacity of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call from non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústec region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Raphaya's case from the last time.
In the last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the fact that the materials would become familiar with it and that they would take a "any opinion" to this.
He also stated that he has not yet spoken to the President, and that he is not in agreement with him in the nearest time.
According to the UOHS statement, there's no reason to appeal because Rafaj wasn't accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and News.cz last week have written that the police are interested in Rafay's meeting with Jiri Junk.
Meetings have put in connection, inter alia, with the decision to compete for the controversial project of the new Berlin Hospital for eight billion, which Czechs strongly promote.
The bitch admitted to the meeting, according to him, they were working on his "sential activity".
Also Rafai speaks.
The representative of the Ústek region called upon the Government to appeal to Rafael at the end of June.
He also asks for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the UNHS on public procurement under the Deputy Commander for Transport Jaroslav Kominek is not transparent and has the characteristics of a arbitrary.
Last March, the police arrested the Antimonopoly Office for a toll selection.
This June then server Current.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses flats written on the company of the powerful training player ČSSD Alexander Chuby.
But the deposit of 3.5 million to the apartment in Brno was paid out of Rafaj's account.
For the second term of office of the former President of Social Democracy, the President appointed Rafaj as President of the Office for the Protection of Competition as of 9 July 2009.
In less than a year, Rafael's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be revoked if it does not perform a function for more than six months or distorts the serious dignity of its function or independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the blannian library, the staff worked hard.
It will help the air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740 thousand, and it will be in service in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to a library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to stay there.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
The prison didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said one of Petr Novotný's blannian readers.
According to the director of the Library of Lukáš Propy, temperatures in the building were often up to 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the object is glassed, and in sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"The sun is based on the large part of the day, thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, there is a big problem for individual departments to blow up, because they must be closed for safety reasons over the night.
We often have so much from morning to 30 degrees in the library," Propa said.
The worst part of it was a study room and a reading room on the third floor.
And the floor above, the exhibition room and the principal.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians collaborating at work and ended up in incompetence.
The problem also regularly lived in a cultural room for lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing left," Dr. Propa said.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to do air conditioning this year in all library spaces.
In the end, there'll only be three circuits out of five.
"As a result of limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most complex space.
College and counter room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and children's department were informed about the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the blanský investment department.
He added that during the first phase, workers in the fall had installed air engineering in the spaces mentioned and adjusted the installation.
Approximately 30,000 crowns.
The city library of Blansko has nearly three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicaga's Opora drove out the Coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every one of the infected athletes comes out with the truth.
Especially when it's an NHL player who doesn't talk about health status as a grave and doesn't publish anything.
As one of the few, he came out of Crawford's line.
The five-year-old native of Montréal was present only at first training, since then missing in the assembly.
"I would like to inform you all that I was positively tested at Covid-19, and for this I spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford's ready to get back into full pressure.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," he added.
With Chicage two Stanley Cups, the successful goalie is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks awaits first the preparatory duel with St. Louis, then in advance to face Edmonton.
Thousands protested against Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstration took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near its official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahua due to a process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government solves another fluctuation of the Coravirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," wrote one of the protesters to his banner, referring to Netanyahu's generally known nickname.
"Everyone sees the emperor losing his dress," it was on another.
The seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first Prime Minister of Israel to be held in office.
He's accused of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust in three bail-outs.
All charges are rejected and marked as a hunt for witches.
According to the local media, the process can last for up to three years. Over 300 Witnesses have been summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, with some 9 million inhabitants.
455 people died of disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce the daily increase in infected animals.
However, after the gradual release of legislation since the end of April, the numbers of infected growth began to grow significantly at the end of June.
Nettanahu’s critic claims that the government did not help enough, for example, the tradeists affected by quarantine measures.
Even the government, as part of the fight against the Coronavir, is concerned about issuing conflicting instructions.
The driver broke the car by a tree and died.
Body must've cut the firemen off the wreckage.
The tragic accident took place around 23 hours with Nevelov at a narrow district leading from the Slap dam.
The driver flew in probably at a small speed down into the forest and broke the car by the tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to get the firemen out of the wreck, including cutting off the roof.
Circumstances are checking out police officers.
They ordered a court autopsy that should, besides, clarify whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addicts.
No more wasting and snoring one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and stakes on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is bringing about a major change in the strategy.
He's moving the discounts, and he doesn't want to spare one collection for another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest environmental pollutants is not any news.
Incinerators and dumps, there are billions of clothes left every year.
The view of the low fashion, often rejected access to clothing, but in recent years it has changed quite quickly.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to the sale, will not simply buy.
The company does not want to spare one collection for the second and at the end of each season the products increase below their production price.
Moreover, according to Michal Mikka's owner, the new and old collections and blind follow-up of rapidly changing fashion trends are removed.
"All traders with discounts are already counted in purchasing goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi Michal Mika.
In addition, he wants to support the company's local business with his approach.
"Every product our product is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on making a large part of our collection composed of so-called bass pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and supernatural.
The segment of premium brands is typical of any discount, the price of the product is simply equal to its quality and the discount is not necessary," says Mika.

"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was pleased with the city's leadership," said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intense creation.
It took about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
In the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an intern camp where they held him for weeks.
But he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp because of the Nicholase Winton organization.
In 1939 Taussig entered the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to enter the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later finished pilot training in Africa's South Rhodes and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times, as well as native Teplice, which gave him honorary citizenship.
Six-four-year-old Kamil Vacak, whom people in the business of street graphic art have known under Camo's nickname, has been working with sprays in the thermal streets for over 20 years.
With the graffiti started on the surfaces that for these purposes were set out by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
The storm of Hanna arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (north midnight SELČ at night to today).
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, approximately 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and at his movement over the mainland, he was weakening on a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, coastal areas are at great risk for residents of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong wind and intense precipitation; along with local floods, the AP reported failures of electricity and various material damage, including damaged ships.
On Saturday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott reported a state of natural disaster for 32 periods in the South of Texas, and recommended a voluntary evacuation of people.
The strongest warnings have been received by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but it is a living force to hit the area long almost 500 kilometres before gradually moving above the northeast Mexico.
"Akoli Hanna is now a tropical storm, can strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous tidals and isolated tornadoes pose a threat," warned the American National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, local time (after afternoon SELČ) was a storm in the field of americo-mexic border and accompanied by a wind at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Mexican Gulf, it was accompanied by a wind speed of up to 145 km per hour, but it gradually went down to 112 kilometers an hour, which again brought Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
Local authorities have asked the storms to stay home and not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the Coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states that pandemic disease covid-19 is the most.
In view of the existing security measures and the need to respect the distances are a major challenge and possible evacuations.
The exhibition shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo period of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test for the Coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to disease.
Local authorities have called on all the evacuated authorities to take the handles and disinfectable gels with them to the safe house, if possible.
"We still don't have it any further.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted the AP Chris Birchfield, which works for National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
The predictions say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could rain in just a few hours, in some cases it was nearly 500 millimetres, which, together, could flood a number of seamen on the coast.
Zeman will lend general rank to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Paul Lipk Wednesday.
It comes out of the overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for renting the rank of the Brig-Gen is the August entrance of Lipka to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance of Multinational Northeast Division in Poland.
Lipka has yet to act as representative of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
At the end of June, Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government.
July from the beginning of August will replace Brigádní General Karel Řehk as Deputy Commander of the Multinational District in the Polish Elblag, commanding forces of the Allied presence in Poland and Pobaltí.
In March he became Director of the National Bureau for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government suggested that Lipk borrow the rank of the Brig-Gen.
According to the Occupational Soldiers Act, higher rank may be borrowed from the soldier for the duration of the elected function or for the performance of a service task that requires the lending of higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the alliance division shall correspond to the general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been borrowed has the same rights and obligations as being appointed to this rank.
However, it is not entitled to an adjustment of the payment that would correspond to the level.
The lending of the rank lasts until the reason for which it has been granted.
"The Lipka Boundary demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subordinated.
In an important way, they participate in carrying out the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the military in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June to propose a promotion.
The midday promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have Coravirus standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help limit the spread of new coronavirus.
It was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the departure or wearing of the ring on the aircraft and at the airport, however, the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unloaded.
She informed Reuters about it.
"I am pleased that my colleagues adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European aviation conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from six years old, to follow the recommended distance in security checks and check-in at the airport.
The aircraft must also provide enough fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerollies will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules on which officials have agreed shall meet at least certain requirements of airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
On Arctic Spicberg, the heat record fell, measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen 41 years old record fell," said the Norwegian weather institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21,7 degrees Celsius, which exceeded the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees.
The total of two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicerka, located about 1300 kilometres from the northern pole.
The tipboards are heated faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from warming other Arctic sites - from Alaska to Siberia, is presented in last year's report from the Norse Center for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in the Spicberg Islands, according to him, rose from the 1970s by three to five degrees.
By 2100 it may rise even by 10 degrees if greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth in Špicerki can result in ever-frozen soils, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause larger amounts of lavin and soil slides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which are dependent on ocean ice covers.
The British, who return from Spain, expects a compulsory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also invited citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain, which are not necessary due to the risk of divisive disease.
The Canary Islands and Balear Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after their return, people must be in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
This decision was taken to prevent possible spread of the virus in Britain," she stated in her statement.
"We have always made it clear that if it is needed, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British letter Metro, the latest announcements will hit the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain belongs to a very popular holiday destination.
The British, among other things, are concerned that they will be paid by the hospital in case they have to leave the holiday for 14 days in isolation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne ordered a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The event has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go all family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a train driver, and I don't think my employer will agree to come back from a vacation for two weeks in a quarantine," said Metro Hunter.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over 900 newly infected ones have always arrived in 24 hours in the last two days.
The authorities in some areas are already tightening the cranial measures, such as Catalonia trying to reduce all nightlife and thus preventing people from falling short.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out an increased risk of disease in Catalan, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity buy-out model will be discussed by the Government
The government will discuss on Monday a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Unit of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill calculates that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price will be lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
The Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíč (for the ANO) and the power company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely variant is that people will save electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on markets is always uncertain, which has demonstrated several times in the past.
The aim has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price may be both under the market price of the power supply and above it.
The final impact at application time of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread between customers according to the size of the brand - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
Havlíček stated in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and the Dukovan construction people would make it.
Otherwise, the impact on the tens of the crowns will be per year per family, which is much less, according to him, than people pay annually in electricity invoices to support the so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawattthodin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, is to be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Stock Exchange for the year 2021, on which traders are now most stocked, is currently around EUR 45 (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"In the difference in the purchase price and market prices of electricity of EUR 10, the average household supplement could be used by 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, standard equipped with electric appliances, including electric plates and ovens, which, however, do not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," wrote in the documents for the Ministry of the MPO.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The koronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be highly speculative," said ČTK earlier the Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law calculates that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, or by the person designated by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions of electricity purchase, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, even repeated, to the end of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon design defines as a nuclear reactor power plant connected to an electrical system with a installed capacity of 100 megawattts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček had previously stated that the new production block should have an output of 1200 MW and every year to produce nine terawatthodin electricity, corresponding to the 10 expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The model for financing the new teaching block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should finance the construction facility on an annual basis, with a 2% interest in operation.
The financing model disagrees with the opposition, the possibility of Dukovany building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be involved in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also pay all additional costs.
In May, the CEO of ČEZ Daniel Benes said that the expected sum for building a block at the current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new teaching block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has withdrawn the material on the support of tourism in the media for two billion
The material according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic has withdrawn two billion crowns from the post office.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for the ANO) server ListZpravy.cz said that the material is still working on.
He warned about the document in eKlepu (electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday of the server Zpraźdy.cz.
The Ministry's plan was justified by the fall in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the Coravir crisis, the media has seen a loss of income.
The proposal sparked criticism of opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the draft, which is now to look at the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money for advertising in TV, radio, press, internet, billboards or station areas via the state tourism agency.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would get TV.
Most of them would have won Nova and Prima's private TV.
Printed journals and weeklys would receive 400 million and the same part would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in metres.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid August and last a year.
"The material is still working; it is not yet in the form that should be presented," said Dostálová, without further details of the List of Reports server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to Chief of the TOP 09 Market of Pekar's Adams, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this obvious contempt will get a wound between eyes in autumn," she wrote on twitter.
In fact, he rejects the fact that this is about helping the media hit by a crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We can count on it, of course, it could be less and more.
It is a work material," she added.
Initially Save tourism does not give a media campaign to promote domestic tourism sense.
"We want two billions for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said the president of the initiative Tomáš Barčík on Sunday.
If two billion crowns are located in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, writing an initiative in an open letter to the government.
Lifeware, beer cock and death like a weed of grass
The postmortem is also the third album entitled "A Death" which is a bleak of the Brno poet's grass, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who left also a year ago, 24 May.
In Frič's discography is the fifth item and, like in previous titles, there is a major emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the very outstanding interpreter.
Frič, the year 1949, was, of course, influenced by the American beat generation, but the inspiration was passage through his own, personal experience and also very inward manifestations of faith.
But there was some agitated chase away, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, absolutely tolerant.
In this context, I think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), my masters will apologize.
Frič's album offers recordings of the 2006 author's reading, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to him, whether it was celloist Josef Key or Honza Bartonň and Winner Holata.
I would like to help - the words of the Ostrava poet Peter Hruška about Frič's long poem compositions.
"She was proud and unending bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our world threatened by destruction.
The world, which is becoming more and more affected by the grievous consumption of vanity and greed, is increasingly relinquishing what his soul was created from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a steak of those who knew that the values for which he was created were few of them, but who also knew that only because of the general interest they could not be ruined.
These poems reminded that man might have to lose all things expensive, but it is not irrelevant how he would lose it.
If he sells himself to a general bankruptcy, sceptically resigns, intimidatingly shuts down, or stays in a calm and proud perpetuity of what he believes and what he loves."
Parubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and President Jiří Paroubek are not a paid advisor to social democracy.
The President of the Parties and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said that on Prima Party TV today.
About the fact that Paroubek should be Hamočková's advisor, he briefed the ListNews server on Friday.cz.
"We'll write a text from time to time, he'll send me some material and I'll read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, this was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that sometimes I read his opinion is so many people are," he said.
In subsequent discussions with Member of the ODS, Mr Jana Černoch said that many ODS members still "not necessarily listen to Václav Klaus' views."
He thinks it's okay, because it's an experienced policy and a former party president, which is also the Paroubka case.
The fact that the media make an affair is marked as the mark of this year's cucumber season.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek served as Hamáčkova's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that at the fourth position of the candidate party in the oral region, the chairman of the local cells, Petr Benda, which is connected to Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile's head, he's a kick in the ass, smothers the Swedes' friend
The 22-year-old American pole has ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat younger Duplantis for two years, and last year, he had overtaken him to the presence of the NCAA University association.
"We had a battle a year before, and then he won, and I was second, and then we threw it away.
In both cases it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 metres.
But since then, Duplantis has fired the string up and is now in the highest turquoise spheres alone.
In just twenty years, he became a world recordman, in Toruni on 8 February, he crossed the line of 6.17 meters, one week later, in Glasgow added a centimetre.
"He's been jumping six meters in 18 years since he finished high school," recalls Nilsen's peer for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew up with a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would degrade.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Even though Nilsen's account of success is thinner to know than the one proud of Duplanets, American takes similar goals.
In February this year, he improved his inner personal record to 5,93 metres. Last August, he won the gold medal at the Panamaian games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought for the American expedition to the world championship where he ended 13.
The closest milestone to him is to taste Diamond League for the first time.
"It is my priority to get on a professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead at actions like Olympic Games, World Championships or Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up to Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think it's possible soon," Nilsen thinks.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a head start in all the rest of his training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he'll want to increase it even further.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an invalid pension, a unable son.
She's waiting for a court of law.
The money that 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is mainly designed to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman could be in prison for up to eight years.
Because of his poor health, the court of a sick man of lawlessness removed and his mother established a guardian who, among other things, had to manage the money of his son.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 until this January used part of the disability pension money to her son for her needs and prepared him by 400,000 crowns," said the police spokesperson Dana Ladman, claiming that the accused woman complained that as guardian she had a specially imposed duty to defend the interests of the injured woman.
A woman according to the order of the court, although she made an account to her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the healthcare facility and paying the necessary medication, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and the operation of the household," he says.
That she can't use her son's money for her own need, a woman confessed.
But she was fighting by helping with them in paying family expenses.
"We had problems in our incomes to tighten the operation of the household.
We never bought anything super-standard.
It was always for things whose purchase would have been approved by the son.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
The findings of the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments from the limestone, among which there are fine blades which could be used to cut meat, and the pointy objects that could serve as poats or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said Cipriian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and chief author of one of the two studies which were published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of Chiquihuite, located at a large altitude, have been living for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory has talked about the fact that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens passed across the mainland bridge from today's Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique vertebrae used to kill mothers and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this cultural culture has subsequently expanded in large parts of North America.
This model, however, received cracks in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
In a second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different localities throughout North America prove their human presence on the continent over 26 000 to 19 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland before they had been assumed.
Some could have gotten to America by boat.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the development of so-called cultural culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada in Albert's province.
So far, the interest in tickets comes with an optimistic scenario, says the sellers.
Gradually, prices are reduced
Sales of flights in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Although interest is still about half the time compared to last summer, demand is increasing by up to 20 percent each week.
The development after the crisis thus adds the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
The fares of the flight are gradually reduced.
The most sought destination is according to salesmen in particular South European States.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece run.
At Letuška.cz, flights to Croatian Split are the most sold.
From other countries, Britain is the most wanted, but it was always one of the most difficult destinations.
The average flight price is also reduced.
At the Letuška.cz portal, about CZK 6250 was around CZK 3000 per year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destination, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices also fall down to some European places, such as Spain or Italy in recent weeks, by about five.
The crisis has affected the behaviour of customers who now buy tickets with a much smaller advance than before because they are afraid of further development of the Coronavirus situation.
According to previous information, Kiwi.com reduced the time of purchase of tickets prior to departure by about 10 days a year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets with much smaller advance, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said the vice president for Kiwi.com Michal Šindelář.
Current is the average booking time before departure 21 days.
Together with the growth of sales, there are also numbers of renewed air lines from the Czech Republic.
At Prague airport, there are currently regular links to more than 60 destinations.
The last summer season is about half the destination.
Big finale tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the framework of PDC took to the grand finale.
There will be an experienced nine-four-year-old Scottish arrow Gary Anderson and surprise tournaments, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van day Bergh.
Gary Anderson took Justin Pip on his first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table ladder.
But James Wade also advised himself, and in the quarterfinal, he fought seriously with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home a world day before.
"Following Scots" had a force in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, the tombman escaped from the shovels, dominated the extension, and after 18:16 he won the place in the finale of the tournament, which he already ruled in 2018, when in the wonderful battle he defeated Mensura Suljovich 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play a fantastic wave.
The six-year-old tipper first surprised the world's six Nathan Aspinalla, in a dramatic battle they pushed Joa Cullen and in the quarter-final following the sharp arrival he also conquered Adrian Lewis.
The big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength, but in a calm playing Belgian then received an excellent series of series, which then more or less kept it to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high skinning, which he sometimes exposed the insecurity of the doubles.
Cases of coronavir occurred at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new kronavirus in the Czech Republic was first discovered, 15 212 people have been ordered by it.
Almost 9 600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5 254 people are sick.
It's coming out of data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases in this week exceeded two hundred consecutive times.
Maximum was 281 cases Friday.
On Thursday was positive 235 tested, day earlier 246 and Tuesday 206.
There were 169 infected on the first working day of this week.
9 590 people have been treated in the Czech Republic since-19, i.e. 63 percent of all who have been infected.
Most of them had a mild course of course.
In the hospital, according to the latest data of the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavirus, 19 of which are treated as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in the conversion of 100,000 inhabitants still exhibit Karvinsko, almost 59.
Followed by the District of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Mistice with 36 infected people for 100,000 in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected persons in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavirus are being applied since Saturday.
People must wear handles at internal mass events of over 100 people, it is about cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside the buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the current thousands of people in half.
In the world, the number of people who proved to be infected with new coronavirus crossed the limit of 16 million.
It was introduced by the American University of Johns Hopkins, who followed the pandemic on a global basis.
The balance of victims who died of covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand according to this source.
The last million infected came to statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on 22 July.
The largest proportion of fast-growing cases in recent days had over 4.1 million infected United States, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people were infected by the authorities.
The infected ones are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization has announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have arrived worldwide from Thursday to Friday, which is the highest daily balance from the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the human states, such as the USA, Brazil or India, according to the Reuters agency, but the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries around the world over the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The warrant appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case today officially announced by KLDR.
House air is up to five times worse than outdoors.
Health for air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
The Israeli Department of Human Health, Carol Abraham, quoted The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, there is a need for damage in households right now that many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the U.S. Environment Agency (EPA), according to which household air quality is five times worse than outdoor.
World Health Organization (WHO) considers that due to the poor quality of the air in their homes, 3,8 million people die a year prematurely.
"Because of the Konavir epidemic, which has forced many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on household air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one cares about the quality of "house air".
Dangerous can be things with which a person normally comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"Dad didn't have many years," she told him for Aha! The oldest daughter of Gotta Dominika, saying that Master Havla couldn't come to his name and whenever the speech came to him, Karla always got angry.

"The father expressed in some article after the revolution that he had been easier than him.
That Havel may have put himself in a drawer at a dark time, but if he had any kind of rebelled, then he had an end to his career," says Gott.
But he adds that in the end, the Czech greats found their way.
"I know the word Havel couldn't even hear in his 60s.
But then the President congratulated him by letter of his birthday and suddenly started to change his relationship with him," he recalls Dominik.
In fact, ten years later, Gott invited the former President to celebrate his seventies at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because then Mr. Havel used to invite him home regularly in Bertramma," she added a blonde whose father died last October.
He also said that Václav Havel had never received state honors.
After all, he had only reached him in 2009, although it was already out of the hands of his successor in the function of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honour will be received in memory, current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of White lion and thus honor his memory.
