Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white cloth
He's a charismatic.
The Mass of Release and Healing take away the crowds for him to serve.
He was a dozen years old when things got inexplicable in his life.
Today, through Franciscan, others experience it.
To be delivered by the Fr. Witko Mass about release and healing bring up crowds
Once, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, with a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated.
Joseph Witko's father prayed for him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The doctors said: “Operation is not needed, the deposit is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents cried out of luck.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s spiritual activity began to experience as a teenager.
In their dreams, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awake at night and inclined to pray for the dead and those who died at a given moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happened to the man who committed mortal sin.
“My body started to change.
I lost people's qualities and started to pick up the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he couldn't get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"In the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the saint, I was released and returned to the human form...", he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these weird experiences.
It matured in his calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
Not only did he want to talk about Jesus in the disciplines.
He begged people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renew Community in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease are taking part in the Mass for healing performed by Father Witko.
The clergy, however, underlines that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not fleshly.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th – September 26th), the team of Kolping FRAC earned its service to the current Polish master Dartom Bohórisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTO Superligi of Stołowa.
Jarosławians in such a personal set that they presented with grotesques have little chances of winning with the league sovereigns.
He showed it well with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the Jarosławian composition they would reach the third in a row of triumph in the new season.
I don't think young Asian Qiyao Han has yet gotten to win with dozens like Grek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most predictable Poles, namely Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest single star in the MOSIR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosławia.
Both at the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC ran 2-1.
Kou Lei probably sung Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górek after an emotional five hundred fight – Pavel Siruck.
After that, though, it was worse.
Gionis didn't stand a chance, Lei.
You could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han didn't go to Badowsky.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trząskowski's announcements, a programme of free prevention studies for seniors 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it did not gain the acceptance of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
The agency explained that the target group was badly selected.
"The greater effects may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may lead to greater difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to falsely positive results of the studies", said.
The department's decisions don't understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people study themselves, they'll then go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it's just about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps to detect diseases quickly and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“I find it difficult to imagine that the experts running are saying: Let us not study, because they will be long queues with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state,” added the PO policies.
Palestine answers to Israel: We will break down any agreement we have made before
On Thursday, President Mahmud Abbas announced at the UN General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of an annex bought by Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will come into effect, will come to this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made", he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely", he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all of our rights with all our means – the few important that will be the consequence of this – committed completely to the application of international law and the fight against terrorism", declared President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the 17th September elections, was once again given a mission to form the government.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he won them, he would announce the annex of the Jordan Valley and intend to join Israel all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jasper Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements which the United States held.
On the ground of Palestinian universal elections, Abbas also promised to hold the UN General Assembly during the 84-year-old session.
It was last held in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I call the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, the local elections and all those who would object to them, will have to answer for their actions before God and international community", declared the solemnly Palestinian president.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, for the exercise of the powers conferred on “the full UN members and all its bodies and bodies”.
The Palestinian leader has completed the speech by calling on the international community to "respect Israel with all due respect to the provisions of the United Nations".
The Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon briefly replied to the address of Abbas, saying that the Palestinian leader “will concentrate on efforts of the Palestinian Authority directed against Israel rather than fighting against calls for terrorism in Autonomousa under his leadership.”
Danon, as recorded by the agencies, did not refer to Netanjah’s announcement of Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators at sensitive points of Thought
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save a human life.
The City Emergency Station in Przemyśl wants these devices to be located at the most sensitive points of the city.
The officers received congratulation diplomas from the Voivodship Emergency Station in Przemysl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrkek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpacki Customs Office in Przemysl.
On August 28 they served in the Polish-Ukraine border crossing in Medice. Officer of the Customs and Treasury Service noticed a unconscious male in the pedestrian area.
Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, the wife of the activist, called on 23 September, the Secretary of the Communist Party from her home village to announce that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
Cao's morgue saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, his ears, his nose and his mouth were all in his blood,” says a woman.
"They didn't let me bring my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted on signing a statement that the husband was seriously ill, and he died as a result of a "unhappiness."
PLN 105 million for companies in video games industry from National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million will be made available to gambling companies creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the third edition of GameINN.
Among almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was, among other things, the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR-based engine of a real world map together with an application that allows data to be transmitted by users; a test and training platform to verify practical skills at work and career improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulation of real manufacturing processes using innovative virtual world interaction with the real world, using the 4.0 concept of the NCBR sent on Friday by PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sector is to increase the competitiveness of Polish video games industry in the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government figures, the value of the Polish video games market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"The Specially prepared GameINN Research Agenda and already providing 300 million PLN support to entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme represents an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", read in the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
"Included by the government, incentives for business innovation, such as R & D relief schemes, capacity enhancement programs, IP box or support programmes implemented by NCBR are driving innovation companies and allowing them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market", evaluates Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of the Science Department points out that innovation money is not only going to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remain in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from a reduction in R & D in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of the calculated R & D costs was PLN 1.7 billion, resulting in more than PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of support provided by the NCBR in three GameINN editions", stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
The Director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that in two previous funding contests worth more than PLN 211.2 million were awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The great interest of III competition and the variety of applications shows that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"The fact is that, as in the previous editions, projects are particularly happy to include not only entertainment solutions but also industry-related 4.0", adds.
In GameINN's third competition, even PLN 20 million were able to apply for entrepreneurs, business consortia and business consortia with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding of approx. 317 million PLN.
The budget of the competition was PLN 100 million at the time of the award of the competition, but was increased, so 27 projects were awarded PLN 105 million.
Detailed information on the results of the III GameINN competition is available on page ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
There was an event on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived at the end of August from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch disappeared from the locker room.
Not what, because it's worth €70,000.
The angry Danishman didn't show up in class the next day, explaining stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the start.
There are private safes available in the lockers in the locker room, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he confessed to stealing at the end of the Diaby-Fadiga.
A 18-year-old had already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Daniek to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most predictable young generation footballers in France.
He hit Nice as a 13-year-old to debut in the first team three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as the newspaper "L'Equipe" said – the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
So far he has begun disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that we need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that the autumn infections are approaching.
At least 30-40 seconds need to wash sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us wash them less!
Just warm water and normal soap – it's not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even advises them).
Washing, we wipe not only the pants and uppers of the hand, but also: the finger ends (folded or single) – wipe them with colossal movements of the inner hand, the spaces between your fingers (retribute your hands, rub your fingers), the thumbs – each thumb we cover the other hand, and in this embrace we turn it to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when we can't wash our hands) we should wipe out our hands with wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch wash hands or door (commendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them up by a paper towel.
The president of Iran says he has rejected the offer of talks with the US, Donald Trump denys
Tehran has not spoken to the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer to abolish sanctions by Americans, President Hasan Rowhani declared on Friday.
President Donald Trump commented that this Iranian party had asked to lift up its restrictions on what he refused to do.
According to President Hasan Rowhani, Americans have proposed that all sanctions imposed on Tehran be lifted in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The president of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He announced that he had met with American diplomats because he had become the focus of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not make talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final result will be," Rowhani said.
A day earlier, Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and the European parties to a nuclear agreement have rejected the favour of American sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the United States’ nuclear agreement “are a pre-condition that does not allow for dialogue.
If we can bear this initial condition, and if America lifts up sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not rule out meetings with President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation at the UN General Assembly last week.
Trump said, "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected Iran's request.
"Iran wanted me to abolish the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said 'no!' the President of the United States tweeted.
A voltage with a nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to mitigate the tension between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the agreement with Iran in 2015, which were signatories.
It held that, in exchange for the abolition of the economic sanctions of Iran, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAA).
Since the US’s withdrawal from the May 2015 agreement, the other signatories repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
Nothing's come up yet.
Washington uses a tactic to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if the raw material is not authorised, it will restrict its obligations, as a result of the agreement, every 60 days.

Judge of the Military Administrative Court of Warsaw and husband of Emilia flock, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, was involved in stalking judges, was restored on Wednesday to the decision of the NSA.
Reason: no disciplinary action has been opened to him, and therefore there is no reason to sustain President Wojciech Mazura's orders to withdraw it from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, opened a hearing at the end of August, but it has not turned into an investigation against him.
Although, in such cases, the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court, must take the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the Sheer Group was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schydt is denying his share in the Hierter group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except falsified screens and the words of his wife, with whom he divorces.
That is exactly what the other judges claim to be connected to the 'Cath': they're all innocent, and there's no evidence.
And it's pretty possible that they're gonna stand on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't stick her finger in order to secure evidence from their electronic media, it also silentlys the content of Emilia Shmydt's phone, which kept it in June on another case.
The police did not finger their fingers to secure the devices of those who, as persecutors, indicated in the February report by Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There's no evidence-- no Szmydt case, no case "Cast."
Also, there is no case for the head of NICK Marian Banas to rent a stone to the basements and hide income.
CBA shall check his property claims.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Commission of the Polish Ethics won't take Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to take a qualifiable decision to cancel Banasia's alternates and to appoint him as a p.o. his lawyer, although the law of such a superstitious combination does not provide for).
The whole thing reminds me of an American movie new, I guess, about how my wife goes home and getting married with a lover in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated she can't baptize her word.
She's standing in the door, and at that time, the lover jumps out of bed, dresses up and leaves.
And the husband used to wash the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is this?
Who is this woman?
My husband is asking, "What woman is she?"
Only that in the case of "Cast" or Banasia, there is a state parody.
And it's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump name
Earlier this season back to competition after the mother's break, the brown medalist of the world championship from London 2017, defeated 1.85 and 1.89 in the first test and in the second 1,92.
1.94 has only been able to get it in the third approach.
"I'm so glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely failed.
In the final, I will have to jump more technically," she admitted before the Eurosport Litwinko camera.
In the eliminations the best was American Vashti Cunningham and Belarus Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.
Both parties did not shake any heights as the only one.
Women's jump finals are scheduled for Monday.
Start at 19.30 Polish time.
Cornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a tough state
He hit the hospital, and his doctors call him heavy.
It should be added that he's conscious and conscious.
“We believe it will come out of this, that it will win again.
We all pray that she returns to health," said the anonymous person Cornelius Morawiecki in conversation with the newspaper "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I live in the next family and politics" said Cornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he gave to journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" announced that 78-year-old Cornel Morawiecki had been researched into a military hospital in Wrocław.
“ I had strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
It worked out I had a jaundice.
But the worst part was in front of me.
When a computer CT survey was conducted it was found that I had a cancer of the pancreas...", the father presented the prime minister.
A few days later, in the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawiecki went through a serious operation.
According to Morawecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal band priest Zbigniew Kras to hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, thank you so much.
Fortunately, I don't think I have any metastasis.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I'm putting myself in the hands of specialists who are more than a good thought.
So far, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some state of use.
I hope everything will be fine in January, Cornel Morawiecki, in his talk with the "SE".
"If I were too late to study, it would be tragic, and I'd say goodbye to that pit...", he added.

The power of the Lead Jumps.
The title of relations with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon on a hypodrome on Oleandra Street in Oław, may be for some misguided people.
To the true power of the road is far away, but this is what we call one of the kinds of competitive...
The jump power competition is to overcome the rider and horse’s increasing obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed more than two metres.
It is worth adding that the world's long and still unaffected record, established still in 1949, by the Chinese Albert Laraguibel on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, so high in Oláw no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazon at 135 cm also to the worst doesn't belong to...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "In the saddle", were a showful part of the previous "Tucznejski races", which we write more about in this issue, on page 22.
The competition was followed by eight amazones, training in the Olaw JKS.
Four of them competed on corn, and four of them on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra was the best involved with the crazy Sprinter.
This little, but how a dynamic rumac began from breaking down obstacles at a height of 40 cm, and it was finished only at the station with a top beam separated from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it was easy not to submit, and only after three further refusals, it was removed from further competition by the jury.
The second place in the ponies' jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, entering the "Famy" and the third place on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest tournament participant - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles to a small "Carmen" mare.
Even greater emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and viewers during a competition involving large horses.
Paulina Szewczyk, who had a “declaration” and Anostasia Abrahamko, was on her way to the “Lotce” estate.
Fortunately, nothing bad happened to other than minor punishments or amazons, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of a young "Wineta" mare on the park had it by Wernika Łuchieewicz.
There was either an assist coach or another horse to a couple, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" was squeezed.
After counting the obstacles from the park, she was also able to get off full, so the moments in the box and in the spring were dangerous. “It is all under control”; John Sienkiewicz calmed down a little of these scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Ever since the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been well known in the park, enjoying a beautiful presentation of "Whisky".
This noble mare, in pairs with an experienced Amazon, followed by a second approach in the final stage as the first one jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at this moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also counted the same height on the “Dedeclaration”, Veronika Łuchieewicz on “Vinecie” and Anastasia Abrahamko on “Lotce”.
So all of these performances went out together, and finally along with the amazons on the ponies in the Radecki's tact of march performed an effective honor round, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you.
The Jedzierecki Sport Club “In Siodle” thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the 16th “Tęcznej Jóźdecki”: the Municipal Office in Oláwa, the Wodowów Zakładów and Canization in Olawa, the District Starostowow and the company “Mustang”.
Max Kolkoko is cut off from KWW Pathotic Revolution of Max Kolanko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusz Max Cologne was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has guided its proposal, in particular, to young voters with right-wing views.
Prior to the elections, Kolkoko announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Pawł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions did happen, and himself the Patriotic Revolution of Max Koloko did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolenko informed on Twitter that he had completed his cooperation with the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolko.
"I'll wait for the KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to join my person in/in the listed entity", he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not known yet whether the journalist will continue to act if it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On July 4, in the U.S. Day of Independence, a journalist, Mariusz Max Kolko, informed about the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolkoko has been famous for running on YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments about events in Poland and in the world.
“ We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonko said.
The party's agenda includes judicial issues (it should be chosen in general elections), tax changes (balancing the amount of tax-free for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the Eastern State of NATO, with particular attention to Poland), carrying out a referendum on possession of arms, restrictions on the number of Members or the introduction of single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolkoko posted information on his profile in social media suggesting that #R will connect forces with Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions finally happened.
UBS: Golden near the balance point
"The euro will continue in the coming months in the vicinity of the ceiling of 4.35 PLN, which will be accompanied by weak economics in global markets", says Michael Boliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a strong pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy call for stabilising gold quotations on the current ceiling", evaluates the specialist in the conversation with Bankier.pl.
Despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policies.
"If gold is properly valued, the euro should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – so little are Polish bonds.
A much more favourable profitability from Polish securities is offered bonds from emerging markets", says Michael Boliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's economics.
“Global slowdown may be further deepened, but it should not result in a severe recession, and as much as possible, the dynamics of GDP fall slightly below zero”, says Michael Boliger.
"Investors should be unaffected by global actions that may harm the lack of prospects for dealing with trade conflict on the US-China lines and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trumpa's impeachment procedure and brixit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively weakly", results from the latest letter to investors by the main management authority of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The euro-area shares should behave worse than the US, as they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowing down", read the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after a hossa in the most secure bond markets, the profitability of the German 10-years even increased to a minus 0.74%, it is still possible to increase profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term, with a view to mitigate the monetary policy of banks.
The biggest reduction field has Fed, which should lead to the weakening of the US currency over the next years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the € 1.29 threshold, which would mean the 19% potential for strengthening the single currency into the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will result in a decline in monetary policy in the world.
"For keeping the dollar strong in a long time, they may not allow deficits in the current and budgetary accounts", says Michael Boliger.
The Bundeswehrer lost his gun.
trusted German MON report
Bundeswehra has since the beginning of 2014 recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and 19 445 ammunition – due to a confidential statement drawn up in the defense resort of the RFN.
The press belongs to the media group RedaktionsNezwerk Deutschland (RND).

Among the military equipment that is still missing, there are six universal MG3, 11 automatic rifles G3, four automatic G36 rifles, six signal guns, and two P8 guns.
In addition, there is a lack of 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns.
The situation was expressed by Vice-President of the Left, Martin Renner.
As RND told journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "permanent."
All the more so that only a small part of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigations.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "nerve balance".
She also criticized the fact that it did not show that there was a weapon found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and breaking the law governing access to firearms.
The officer rejected the preparation of attacks on leading German politicians from extreme right and racist motives.
On his "black list" the objectives of the prosecutor's office were, among other things, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four weapons of firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
They're crying kids on a plane.
How do you avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for those who are travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the location distribution on the plane.
If the combination travels under the second year of age, the child's icon appears on a specific, reserved by parents or siters.
Thus, the person benefiting from the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place away from that occupied by the baby.
The BBC states that the lines have already informed about the imperfection of this solution.
"The child's icon" will not appear when the ticket was reserved by a third party or if the aircraft changed at the last moment.
As you could expect, the idea divided the interns.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by means of noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
“We need to learn tolerability, because soon we will need a map of the places sitting for breathing mouths, drooling or drunkards,” wrote G Sundar.
Another intern noticed that he had been disturbed by crying children on his plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
The solutions introduced by Japan Airlines are not also lacking.
"Thank you for warning me about the screaming children during the 13th hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major counts the losses from Thomas Cook's bankruptcy office.
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a vacation to Majorka as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
On Friday a representative of the Autonomous Government of Baleary Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand holidayers who will not be able to benefit from October's leave on Majorca, there are also people who were going to travel indirectly with Thomas Cook's related companies, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers, who had to give up holidays in Majorca next month, were German citizens and Scandinavian countries because of the bankruptcy of the UK company.
However, as Pons claims, because Thomas Cook did not drive tourists to the island of Balleary during November-April, losses for the local economy will be reduced.
He revealed that the Baleari government has already started negotiations with international operators on the “entering Majorca” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper shows that in October, over 1,000 people will lose their jobs in Majorca due to the tourism crisis.
About 800 are fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels Majorki property owners requested guests to pay an additional accommodation fee.
The situation has experienced several decades of tourists from Poland.
The Baleari Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca stopped operating until the end of October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy announcement and its cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the daily newspaper "Dario de Ibiza" indicates that most of the hotels in Ibiza, which worked with Thomas Cook, do not carry with the intention of closing offices in the next few weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this balearic island, the British bankrut was cooperating with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Baleari autonomous authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government for the region's support of EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They revealed that the most affected tourists, some 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to Baleari government data, Thomas Cook will provide local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of around EUR 5 million.

"Rz": Smog has captured the government
"The effects of the «Clean air” programme are nickel, and the coal furnaces will kick this winter as if never anything", we read on the first page of today's “Rzeczpospolita”.
"To date, 82 000 proposals for a total funding of PLN 2 billion were made under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand were positive.
The requested requests total more than PLN 915 million, says "Rz", referring to data from the Advocate-General of the Environment.
As the paper indicates, only part of the costs incurred are recovered from the programme.
The results of the announced noise of the journal program are seen as "neutral".
Self-government, quoted by the "Rz", see the failures of "Clean Air" among others in too much bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, mailing of invoices, possible sampling of implementation.
That would improve the action", said Mayor Warminski Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alert note that in the first year, less than 1% of the target of exchanging 3 million mooring boilers was achieved.
As the "Rz", while the programme budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
"In the national budget of the Environment and Water Affairs Fund, 1.4 billion PLN were reserved for this year", read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now negotiations prices
The U.S. Congress agreed to sell 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the contract was concluded, but not the end of our work”, wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on Polish F-35
Polish air forces aim at 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Polish Department of State agreed to sell it.
The Communication emphasises that investment will support national security and US foreign policy by improving NATO security, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland has to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department has indicated that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the execution of engineering, logistics and staff services and related elements of logistics support and programme and staff training.
Fighter Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin is a single and single-engine multi-tasking fighter of the fifth generation.
The plane is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombings and typically hunting tasks of air combat.
Thanks to the application of the Stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for close range radars.
A recent F-35 fighter bought Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgians want to replace them with the ageing F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to be considered as purchasing American combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie manufacturer introduced a series of neutral sex dolls on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes that way.
Barbie manufacturer launched a series of neutral sex dolls
Next to Barbie, with different color leather, figure or frizzer, Mattel has introduced a neutral sex doll.
The "Creable World" series toys carry wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie is to have short hair or long.
Their dressing consists of both pants and dresses.
In the morning, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colours of the skin and with different clothes.
The gender dolls have no more full mouths, long eyelashes and thin plates, or, in the case of Ken, large arms, have also been abandoned.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed gender standards, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made with a particular gender reflect the ambition of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“New dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a high-casic bathing suit and shoes, has been criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes” such as an unnatural body proportions.
The concern reacted to criticism and has already placed dolls on the market with different colors of the skin, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together may have several Members
Zandberg, asked on the ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which they start candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the Levia score will be very good because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levica is not only right anymore, but also has strength," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left hand may have 60–80 Members.
“This may mean that the circle or club Together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how it happens," he said.
Asked whether Lefta will have a separate circle together, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that the diversity of Poles has been rewarded because we have shown that, in different ways, we have been able to agree on a common agenda."
Questioning whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of SLD Włodmierz Szzazta, Zandberg replied that he thought the largest beneficiaries were the centoleves and the left-wing voters.
On the other hand, the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, denied that "the aim of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in elections to the Sejm.
In the case of elections, he indicated that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further in this offer," he said.
"I will say, however, very honest and clear, that if I were in district 44 of the Senate, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," stressed politics.
"I would not want to put my vote on Minister Kazimierz Uzdzowski (KO-PAP candidat)", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Polish citizen Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki of PiS are launching.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa was opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque considered to be the largest in Western Africa.
Muslims came by buses, cars, and walking to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30 thousand faithful.
The building was built by the brast Mouride, which belongs to the Suficé Nurt of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, transferred by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalicul Jinan (Throughs to Paradise) comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmad Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, honored by the confessors as saint.
The mosque is occupied by the Carrarian marble and has five minarets.
The top one's 78 yards.
The swordsman in the middle will have 15 thousand faithful men, and the other can be on the outer esplanade.
In richly decorated interiors you can admire the gypsy dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the gmach still does not compare to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost over 30 million euros, was financed with private donations.
The government, in addition to the ground, has set up lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road robots worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Wrong: Our problem is not Silesia, it's us
Eight league matches without winning the Korona football team will try to stop on Friday's meeting with the deputy Extralas Śląsko.
"Our problem is not to turn back, but to ourselves, we must work on what we're playing," stressed Mirosław Smyła, the coach of the captor.
The last Korona players and so far the only victory in the league has been recorded in the first round, when they defeated the 1:0 winner of the game of the Czestochowa.
Later, the sausage recorded two fires and six failures, and they lost 0:1 on Tuesday with the Lubin Deep in 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I’m very optimistic about the fact that in the last few seconds, football players have been fighting for the goal, and they've tried to recruit.
Their fall to the wall after the last whistle did not result from the collapse, but it was the fall of anger because they were so close," He said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will celebrate the team on the side of the field.
"We have an awareness of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," he added.
On Friday's match in Korona, he will certainly not play a pause for the excess yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, in the staff will not be played by the current Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
It's upbuilding, however, to report to several players with a desire to play.
"We have a headache, and it just seemed like he wasn't, and now it is," said the Wrong.
The defense of the Crown Daniel Dziwiel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the eight league matches in a row without victory, while in extraclass everyone could win with everyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the field, but this moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be already Friday", marked the footballer.
After nine lines of extra class Korona with a total of five points takes 15th position.
The Silesia has gathered 12 more and is placed in the second place.
The fifth match in Kielce will start at 20.30 a.m.
These trees could completely disappear from Europe.
"42% of tree species in Europe is at risk", warns the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN) in the Red Paper of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among other things, cashews and hawks.
The IUCN, established in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of research, came to the conclusion that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and also elsewhere in the world) are "highly at risk".
Among the causes of the Red Paper mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
But the most dangerous are these trees and bushes, which only occur or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European tree, 58% of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper sets out errors in the use of the tree, accelerated urbanisation, too intense tree scrappings, followed by forest fires and changes occurring in European ecostitutions.
According to the report's authors, the existence of many European varieties of bushes, moss and crops is also strongly threatened.
"The consequences of human activities lead to a gradual disappearance of European plant species and create a danger in Europe of extinction of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of the planet", concluded the report by Luc Bas, which heads the European office of IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetina: I will not promise 600+
"Today PiS wants to buy Polish people out, offering them freedom of distribution for credit, which will have to pay future generations," says Grzegorz Schitin in an interview for the 'Rzeczpospolita'.
In his opinion, "the whole Pis policy is a pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetina assures Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the electoral urns.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential than the Kaczyński party.
“Today, people of consciousness who want to live in a normal country are more than those of the PiS, a party that has wronged values such as modesty, humility, transparency, ” says Schyn.
Leader of the Civil Coalition and President of the Civil Platform also outlined the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing data will be taken, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS is dealing only here and now, there is no plan for Poland, although it can be seen after a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is about "starting the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work well - and those who are entrepreneurial".
Schetina explains that the KO program has been a project, which will give the least earners to Poles more by 614 zlotys on the hand, and more earners – also for several hundred.
Politician also indicated that he did not want to race for a division.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the government has bided itself to resurgence until the country's financial downfall has finally occurred", he stressed.
Schetina also stated in his interview for “Rz” that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawecki were afraid to discuss with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose them to hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride goes before the fall.
Kaczyński is a man of the state, like Banish is crystal," he added.
Leader PO also said he has not yet decided to apply for the Platform's leadership.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors
In the Argentinian province of Santa Cruz, six large condors were found – reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The big condors are probably poisoned with a means of killing predators like pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten toxic fallen.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adult.
"This is a great loss for the environment, because it has to reach 10-15 years to become fruitful and able to multiply.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species", says Luis Jacome, BioAndina Foundation, Argentinian environmental organisation.
“I think that the use of toxic baits and poison poses not only this species at risk but all other life forms, including human health,” adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has gone on granting your head a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda – read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, this is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called during the interwar period of the Republic's jewel.
The last time he was ever used by President Ignacy Mościecki.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Duda's arms.
The Senate's Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions Commission voted on a proposal to work on the amendment of the Act on Orders and Remunerations on Wednesday.
The journal says it's not the first attempt to restore this chain of state's head.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has been lost by one vote.
This time, work is flashy.
In early August, the senators devoted this matter to several minutes considering that they would be consulted by the President's Office.
That one came in the middle of September.
"I would like to say politely that the Presidency's office does not give any attention to the position presented in this petition," Minister Andrzej Der wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate Commission continued the issue and again devoted the matter to little time.
"The President's Office told us briefly: it's for reintroduction," said Robert Matuatov of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He put forward an application for legislative work which was supported by the committee.
Police will teach drivers how to ride through the crossroads
The police action will be carried out, among other things, at the intersection of al. Ciepliński with al. Piłsudski.
The uniforms have some kind of connection with recent complaints from the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to behave properly at crossroads.
Friday, September 27th, policemen start prevention action in Rzesz.
The aim is to eliminate traffic difficulties: crossings without exit, not to apply to traffic signals or traffic signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we actually hinder the lives of other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, Deputy President of the City.
His words sounded at a press conference in which city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which in effect creates traffic jams.
Then the President appealed to travellers for reasoning on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to text them while driving.
The theme is kind of taken over by Christian policemen, who are starting the "Extreme Crossing" event today.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of reduced crossings at crossings by drivers entering them without the possibility to continue driving.
This is a frequent misstep, which helps to strengthen obstacles in traffic and to create traffic jams.
It is threatened by a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to the failure to apply to traffic signals or traffic signs and to abnormal parking in the area of crossings.
They will also observe the lack of liquidity, late running from the signal providers, the free crossing of intersections and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What crossings will be carried out?
M.e. on the Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellonska Street; al. Cieplinski z al. Piłsudskiego; Targo Street of al. Piłsudskiego; Sreniawitów Square from Dąbrowski Street or Hetmanska Street from al. Warsaw Insurgents.
This type of shares in Podkarpacia capital will be held on the next Friday of October.

“The officials of the Department for the Environmental Protection of the Old World of Wołomiński and District Construction Supervision have checked the installation on Friday in the town of Zielonka, where waste from the waste treatment plant “Czaka” in Warsaw, reports the Mayor of Volamiński Karol Szyszzko.
The inspectors from the Volomiński mayor carried out a check in the establishment located in the forests belonging to the village of Zielonka.
The Private Trade and Transport Department ‘Dar-Trans’, under contract with the table waste treatment plant ‘Czka’, performs waste management services.
"The operator has been asked to provide documentation related to his activities", said Szyszko.
He added that the audit report would be submitted, among other things, to the Military Environmental Inspector in Warsaw.
The last inspection in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Military Environmental Protection Supervisor in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
At the time it was established that the company did not take samples, measurements and testing of groundwater and did not have the results of the studies of stabilised municipal sewage settlements from the waste water treatment plant "Ques".
Following the inspection of the WIPS, Dariusz Sobota was invited to cease the infringement of the terms and conditions of the decision.
The private “DAR-TRANS” Trade and Transport Company Dariusz Sobota is one of the waste-taking companies in the form of stabilized municipal sewage settlements from the “Question” treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to undertake the disposal of waste in the production site, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw City Water and Canization Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOS was shut down, which was linked to damage to one of the combustion plants.
As informed by MPWIK, the monthly export cost of their exports was 1.7 million PLN (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have a difficult task, you can count on my total support," said Lech Wałęsa on Friday to Małgorzata Kidawy-Błońska.
"Mr. President, for me it is a very important word," said the candidate of the Civil Coalition for the Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former President stressed that, as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, this is now "only a stick of retirement".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You had a difficult task," he said after meeting Lech Wałęsa.
"You can count on my complete support," he added.
“The pre-Polish agendas are known to all of us.
Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman can cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will be the most supportive of your action", said the former president, addressing Kidawy-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked her for her support.
"Mr. President, it's very important to me because no one can talk about freedom, the Constitution, and he knows how important it is to me," she said.
“Let us show that you can make a different, wise policy together, but according to the Constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
That's what you did with your revolution, and we want to change Poland, which is what you wanted to do," she emphasised Kidawa-Błońska.
Kibic in retirement
Wałęsa in conversation with journalists said that he is now "only a stick in retirement".
“ Of course, I look at it.
I hope we reverse the event course, that what was good, proven, (to that) we will return.
The tripartment of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are badly needed.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all of this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe this is what we're going to do this time.
Because if not, we will have a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, consider and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that we are going to improve the state of things that is in Poland with the card", said the former president.
"We must build a new foundation"
She asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “Mr. President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation where we can do all the other things.
Since there is no three phases of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and bring it to the point that it becomes obvious and that everyone will know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."

Poles after first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish netists took their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play a brown medal game on Saturday.
The fourth failure with the Slovaks 1:3 closed the way for Vitala Heynea to win the title.
It was so loud about their problems with the journey to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went with the Slovenian charter to Paris, and several hours later they had training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the people present in the class, the world champion trainer has been nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Mikhal Michko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not to practice volleyball elements alone.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training him.
Talk to me, think about how to rebuild everything as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both players and training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
We're disappointed in two words.
We still believed we'd go back to that game.
We were discussing this game between us at the staff, coach talked to a lot of players.
As two main reasons for failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual coping with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better in this respect than us," he studied.
In his view, the White-Reds did not put any pressure on him, associated with the performances supported by the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament.
He admitted that world champions could have put a little smooth road to the semifinal.
“It may be that if we fail in a group phase in a similar style, we should examine this lesson quickly, and then we would play further in the tournament.
But it's just when you're pregnant," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of Poles will be processed into aggression in the bronze game.
“I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's nothing to fight for.
Last year we won the ME medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country to be visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two group phase meetings they went to Apeldoorn and moved to Ljubljana for the semifinal.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a fine of $25,000 – in a half-year suspension – for the promising words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tours lose patience with Kyrgios, but they still give it a chance to improve.
The summaries of the most unscrupulous professional tennis players in recent years seem to be threatening – 16 weeks of break plus fines, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which the progeny sportsman will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working on his own tennis record for a long time, and he has made the world's own tennis record – he has to pay the highest in the history of discipline for breaking and breaking the rules of law.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportable behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two missiles during a losing match with Karen Chaczanov – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $13,000.
In the US Open 2019, he did not play long, but had publicly said that ATP activists “are corrupt”, which hurt the authorities so much that they implemented disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the said verdict about suspension of starters and further fines.
However, words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the expression.
However, in their justification, the tennis activists claimed that the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgiosa throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost continuous violations of the principle that he had been insulted in a vulgar manner by those involved in tournaments and viewers, hence a high penalty.
The ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately postpone the execution of the judgment by ordering a number of conditions to be fulfilled in the next six months: ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of the current professional tennis players, in particular he cannot swear, destroy missiles, argue with judges and audiences, or any other way of acting unreasonably and vulgarly.
He has also been advised to look for a “long support” from mental trainers during tournaments and to consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who are not dealing with proper behaviour outside the season.
The first comment (in social media) by Nick Kyrgios on the verdict was: "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two week break, since in the Laver Cup, he has had to give up his shoulder injury, so he had to give up the next start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ranking of ATP Kyrgios there is 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over 1.3 million bucks, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the GUS shows that as a good or rather good material situation, 44% of them assessed the material situation.
This proportion earlier was 37.2%, in 2016, 33.5 %, and earlier since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of household situations, it was never more than 30 %.
In total, 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather wrong compared to 11.2% of previous year and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households of self-employed people is best.
In this group, over 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.
On the second pole, households are rencists, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst thing for parents is single - parenting offspring, of which 32% declared a good or rather good material situation.
Among the children, this proportion varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and 48.8% of the homeless households included.
The effects of the 500+ programme are clearly visible in these statistics.
Before being launched (in 2016,) the worst of their material situation was assessed by the parents of single - parenting offspring and multi - child families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all because the proportion of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, there is no clear interdependence at the level of provinces between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments formulate the residents of the Opole province, where their situation is good or rather good, they consider 48.9% of surveyed people.
There are also Lubuskie provinces (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and western pomorskie (47.1%).
However, in Opole, the relative income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusek.
The highest revenue was paid by Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, the public income was PLN 1693.
In real terms (after the price change adjustment) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
In the background of previous years, the score is quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These in terms of person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure on a person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
The household budgets survey suggests that the statistical household population is currently spending 70.1 % of its administrative income, while in 2014 the share still exceeded 80 %, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 %.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush ship last week.
In total, five crew members of this ship have been killed in the last two years.
Previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot each other last week.
Each event occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was moaning off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third parties have been excluded from the case.
In addition, death should not be related.
“The need for all to get involved in putting forward suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stongmatisation or any other repercussions related to the search for assistance", wrote on Facebook Captain Sean Bailey, commander of the ship.
A non-Sillow critical of the Pope.
John Paul II hasn't done anything
In his interview with Piotr Lszzycki Stefan Niesiołowski, he stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, every sentence of his life was accepted."
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rystrzek, laying a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this moderator – the pest of the Church and of Poland – developed his media in the best still in the life of Pope Polak", explained.
PO’s former policies admitted: “There were misdemeanors of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydrzeka did not accept, but had authority and politics could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
But John Paul II did not do so, just like his successors," he explained.
“This is why this fatal issue of pedophiles and the activities of the Church has come to an end, and in fact they are lacking.
I ran a little ahead thinking, but I wanted to point out his whole life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church recently.
The question arises, how possible, that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters", says Niesiołowski in his conversation with the journalist.
In the assessment of former policy PO Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“It is necessary to admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, there were crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship, a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydrzek shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing on this matter and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come pay him", he convinced Niesiołowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis was chased by Jędraszewski, Rystrzek and a couple of others of this type," he summed up.

PZPN feeds burdy at stadiums.
Recognised gryph
The race in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk by small hair did not end tragically when the fans from Wejherowa rac about millimetres missed the goalkeeper of the opposite team, Zlatana Alomerović.
After that incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
This examination of the PZPN commission was subject to strict penalties for Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed in the nearest match for their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to league games until December 31st.
Burdy was also called in the stadium of Zląska Wrocław.
However, here the PZPN ruling was milder because Silesia warned that similar events might occur, and he began to teach the appropriate bodies on this issue.
In addition, the services allowed the shipping sector to be abandoned by the raccoons, to set chairs and forges for the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use water cannons.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in Polish Cup and refused to organise trips to matches including and another edition of PP.
The ban on departures also covered the league games of the Extraclass, but it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in English
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the entire network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the recording of foreign names of cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lwów" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province changes will be made to 94 road signs set at highway A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, clearer and easier.
The new guidelines are based on the amendment of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the towns in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to our change in the law, they will finally appear on the roads to our roads.
The introduction of the new label begins with the Podkarpacki section of the A4 motorway", said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
The changes will be made on 94 road signs set at highway A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand PLN.
First, new markings will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned until 1 November 2019.
What does the idea look like?
It'll be out without the plates, basically the sticker.
They will replace the currently working names of new towns, written in Polish, on already existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one row – first in Polish and then in original, in parentheses.
This will be a great facilitate for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windmill.
In the pond in Zamena in Lower Silesia, inhabitants noticed a swan with problems with wings.
After fishing and a visit to the vet, it turned out that someone had made a target out of an animal – in his body a piece of windmill was found.
‘He received information on the injured bird from the villagers of the Rehabilitation Centre for Animals in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the scene.
It was immediately clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely to avoid harming him and not risking additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of him.
There were cuts in his body", says Marcin Walesek, CEO of Malpol managing company, among others, the rehab center.
I'm living in the middle
"The mornings were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, provided access to water, a safe place in the resort, where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly yet.
The release now would have been related to the fact that he probably wouldn't have survived the winter", adds Wales.
The staff are going to let him go to the same pond this spring after the Rehabilitation Office.
The authorities of the town of Żukowice after receiving information on the cause of the poor health of the animal intend to inform the prosecutor about the case.
An event occurred in Zamenia
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any means to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Head of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.
Gowin said during the talk at the "Sylate of the Day" in the radio One that trade is controlled by international networks that impose on Polish producers so low margins that Polish companies cannot grow properly.
Note that the problem is very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the government of PiS tried to face this at the very beginning of the term of office, but he was given a “endow” from the EC side.
"We won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right person wins the nearest elections and formalises the government, we will return to that subject," he said.
He noted at the same time that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and therefore small trade".
"It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has some means to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.
In May, the EU court felt that the European Commission made a mistake considering that Polish retail taxes were unauthorised.
The retail tax Act envisages two trade tax rates: 0.8 % on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was due from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated an infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It subsequently stated that the taxable person had been put into effect in an unlawful manner.
It also gave an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland refused to accept this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The Mayan decision of the EU court opened the way for the reintroduction of tax, but did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press services reported that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. hearing of the parties and possible hearings.
The need for good few to several months from the time of the appeal to the judgment.
"This procedure takes an average year", said the PAP source in the Court of Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first occasion that the whole family is focused around the child, together celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder that my mother and dad are getting ready for their comfort to look the best of the day.
But before you and you make the final decision on the child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In shops, you can find many machine-made sets, which do not provide the little with proper comfort.
What, then, should be taken into consideration?
The basic criterion for choosing baptism is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks have been baptized, dressed in white sets and inserted into the same barrels or great spirits.
Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, one year, and even bigger.
It is difficult to realize that such a great comfort is already needed by a different dress to baptise.
So if your child has 3-4 months of baptism on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or on the hands of parents or Christians.
The best way to do this is to put him in a comfortable, cotton sleeper or set.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered to be a everyday outfit, it is sufficient to seek out its sacred variants, for example, with a wave bank or a lace.
For the boy, points are perfect with ink of the muskets and plums.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
Girl will look pretty in a simple, tiulous dress
Many parents look forward to the richly decorated, fake dresses for baptism in combination with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers are simply using artificial, non-resisting materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In searching for the right dress, it will be better to look at Asanti for Kids’ shop, which offers elegant cotton lining machines.
Gentle, tiulous skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys' parents had fashion for suits that were copy of the "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or stunts often made young elegance vocally demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been separated by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, dressing shorts, and to this blouse decorated from front as a vest pattern.
These machines look extremely sacred and do not twist movements that recognize the small world.

Voting for a break in the discussions at the time of the Conservatory Party conference
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break in the House of Gmin's session on the date of the annual conference of the Conservative Party, as asked by the government.
A total of 289 Members were announced against – 306.
Commonly, the House of Gmin is not held at the party conference, so that Members do not have to resign or participate in them or from Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a key time as the last weeks before the United Kingdom exit from the European Union on 31 October, the Parliament should not interrupt the session.
The Government's request for a break was announced by 289 Members, against which there was 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The absence of a break may be taken as a political revenge of opposition at the Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was taken by the Supreme Court to be unlawful and for that reason) and for refusing to apologize for it following the ruling of the Judges.
Following this ruling, the House of Gmin resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the stormy debate followed.
Johnson rejected the opposition to blocking the bridge and avoiding early elections.
“It is time to make a breakfast.
It needs to be achieved in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of life.
Brexit must be made so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conservative Party Conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and continue until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main groups of opposition – Labour parties and liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson served by explaining the Parliament's lengthy suspension was just the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", written by foreign media.
The President's Ombudsman definitely commented on these reports.
"This is simply not true," wrote on Twitter the Szybe Spychalski.
The Israeli media, including 'Haaretz' and 'Jerusalem Post', refered to the 'Jewish Insider', say that Andrzej Duda, at the meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish Consulate in New York City, declared that Israel blamed the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katza, who stated in February that “Polishs sucked anti-Semitism with mother milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating expression of his politicians.
He also mentioned shares of aggression at the Polish ambassador in Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who screamed, "Polak, Polak."
“Citat is not only inexpensive.
It's just not true," wrote on Twitter the Bez Błaj Spychalski.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland”.
According to the Spychal portal, "that's what he invented."
According to the speakers “I” during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the survivors of the Holocaust, awarded the Cross of the Commander's Order of Merit of RP Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and to say that the Jews from Israel "such as Israel Kac" are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg's statement was to be interrupted.
Who's Banas and what's wrong with him?
The tenant leased by the governors resulted in a journalist discovering negligence in Marian Banasi's property statements.
We're going to sum up another affair that shakes down the governing camp.
TVN Journalists have revealed that Marian Banas, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not been registered in a property statement of 400 metres away, which is located on the Krakow Hill in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant was in charge of this sexbiznes building (and so rent rooms per hour).
The building itself was allegedly a guarantee of repayment since 2016.
Bertold Kittel’s attention to irregularities was noted in the Superwijer program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia, the tenant rented people a connection to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic encounters".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Banas was responsible for the accusations.
Interestingly, the tenant rented by the governors resulted in a journalist discovering negligence in Banasia's property statements.
For the house itself was described in them, and the income from her hire was to be brought down.
“The babies of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the portal analysis, Banasia's very own building was worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anticorruption Office is currently checking Marian Banasia's property statements for 2015-2019.
Banish announced that he would suspend his activity in the NOV until she was finished. “I am going to marry the marshal for free leave”, he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We don’t hear CBA extend its investigation or accelerate the examination of Marian Banasi’s property statements.
That is why we are forced to hand out state authorities and make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If a regular Pole had so grossly valued the rental of its properties, it would already have 10 controls, tax domain and group management”, he added.
He came high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
It was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a term of 6 years.
His candidacy has been tabled by the Law and Justice and the votes of politicians of that party.
Before that, Banas was involved in the NIC between 1992 and 2005, he worked as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008) Banas was appointed President of the Customs Service and, moreover, the Deputy Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he again sat on the table of the Head of Customs Service and managed the National Treasury since 2017.
For three months Banas served as Minister of Finance in the Government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master places a handle on the market for graphics cards

The new design of the handle for the graphics card is not only a functional solution allowing for a more secure graphic card to be maintained without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": ignoring police orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the warrant for a certain conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offense, a fine, arrest or a restriction of freedom.
Police unionists want to make such a change.
The idea came to the National Committee on Petitions.
"The report is serious because it is now more than half a million cases in Polish courts every year," we read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" found that the petition, which the Independent Professional Union of Police is writing to Members on the amendment of the Code of Declarations, has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Penalties.
He would say: “Who does not submit a request or a recommendation from a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of identical punishment for those who do not follow orders, prevent or make it difficult to carry out business activities”, says the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita", that although he agrees with the main message of the provision proposal, he is afraid that if implemented, he may be used in matters of political manifestation.
"In situations of free demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and rather than mitigate the situation, even to exacerbate it," he adds.
According to the newspaper, 86% of citizens welcomed police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million city interventions each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
My Topol's writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war dramats of the Czech Republic, today listed in one row with Václav Havel.
So from the outset, she had been hanging out the curse of talent that she was trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with a "mighty man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa together with two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're travel actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's Shakespeare's lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not give up the sound of himself, and for the second time he stopped in the infant days.
But they're not heroes. They're the most important in this story.
Everyone is just a background to watch the world where there is no place for artistic commentaries.
It's a world of overkilling provinces, old society, suspicious people, and young people to solve.
A "speak man" turns into an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates the diddascalia, and heroes talk creates this world.
It is a Europe of concern for its future, but also for the endless questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiaries Neckermann are functioning.
The company has problems, however.
According to the VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All the trips with the office reserved in Belgium will be cancelled but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.
The Gandawa Court also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughters: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Today, around 12,000 Belgs are abroad on trips bought out at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by a British company of mothers who caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office calmed down then that customers who bought his trips will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the biggest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy on Sunday night.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the breaking down on Sunday talks to creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the rescue plan already agreed in August, EUR 900 million, the company gained an additional EUR 200 million as a security for the winter period, when travel agents were usually lower.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for a review
Free accommodation in return for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Action is intended to help combat the progressive decline in the population.
Görlitz is the eastmost town of Germany.
A beautiful pastel star attracts 140 thousand tourists annually.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with major problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also struggles with a permanent settlement of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 thousand people.
To fight depopulated, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
150 proposals have been received for the programme so far.
Two thirds of these were made by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
"When we applied, we thought the program would convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
While the city authorities hope that some will be carried out permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain an opinion from the participants in the programme.
Information from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new citizens, offering them accommodation incentives.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme to pay promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
