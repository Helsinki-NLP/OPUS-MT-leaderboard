I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after working all day.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been happy with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's my map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and then to the right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have no food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom will be 13 after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch her ruin my life.
Do your best.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We came up to the top of Fuji's mountain.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Remember how she was?
That belt is too tight.
Playing on the fagot isn't easy.
She just took the job to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer over here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are dying fast today.
Tom's still busy.
You better leave now.
Tom's childless.
I like to read.
We cut off the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What did Tom scream at the crowd?
She's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in the 17th century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he climbed a tree.
The translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing too.
We know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought me in.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills are qualified for the job.
They're dropping croupes.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They don't help.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when I leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joana have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered in black clouds.
I need this more than you do.
He bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave himself a glisten.
What should I do in this situation?
You're going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm angry with Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
Tom's responsible, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised if it happens.
He's single.
That's not what people usually say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you eat this morning?
Jana was as happy as she was when she got a record contract.
I wish you were with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this house if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He'll visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake friend, and he was offended.
The laundry.
This bridge used to be charged with a bridge.
He used to wave on her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We hit a lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it's like.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm completely happy.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom was playing Mary Tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-breed walls standing here.
I spoke English to him and he found out I could make a deal.
Tom must have run.
I see a book.
Did either of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence's fresh.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer me questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There were absolutely no doubts.
I don't want anyone else reading this letter.
He's not married, as far as I know.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh attack.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than what red people live.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's gonna say.
The wedding was held last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's fragile.
I borrowed his comb.
I'm boring.
I write my will.
I'm not that stubborn anymore.
You're not gonna believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If he doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the tour.
Try to talk to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'm gonna have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there until he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do this.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do that tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle it ourselves?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Put it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's clumsy.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better man.
You're stealing, aren't you?
Tom's got to dress up.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom's used to it.
I love this book.
Waste's stuck again.
When I got home from work, I found out someone stole our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like German films.
This works.
Don't be such a wuss.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
He easily acquired, slightly lost.
Remember you've seen me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If it wasn't for her help, I'd never take the exam.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on coming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The service seemed bored.
If you need any further information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
When you get here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I want you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.

"Did you see my phone?" "It's on the table."
Tom went to his locker.
The first jump went bad.
Well, let's eat.
We should give him a gift.
In England, the waiter asked us, "How many beers would you like, half pints, or all?" Since we had no idea how much it would be, we asked him to show us a glass.

I like fish.
