A black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money to repair the falling motorway network, many are beginning to see solutions in a small black box that will easily fit into your car's instrument board.
The device that monitors every kilometer that the motorist drives and transmits this information to the authorities is the core of the controversial effort of Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing America's main roads.
Usually, the great design of motorways suddenly stimulated intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbed for the government to use these little boxes that would record the miles and maybe even where you're going – and then this information would be used to build a tax mark.
Tea party is terrified.
The U.S. Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They shall see how, during the next decade, they can move to a system in which the driver pays per kilometer of the road on which he goes.
Thousands of motorists have already had black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, taken to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It is not a matter of which we can choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to launch a survey of roadside miles at every California Motorists in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
It's what this technology is for.
The fact is that the Trust Fund financed by the taxes that the Americans are paying at the gas station is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars run a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are only able to raise the tax by only one cent.
"The gas Dane is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed trackers up to 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which for example can help limit traffic jams and generate greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, President of the Transport Committee, said that he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation's free market leaders are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for the kilometres.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Strategy in Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative also supports two former U.S. Transport Ministers, who in 2011 encouraged Congress to move towards paying for miles.
The American Senate approved the pilot project for USD 90 million last year, which included around 10,000 cars.
The management of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose everyday life often means insulting many kilometres for work away from the city.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon begin to pay their tax for the miles in question instead of the petrol tax.
The pilot project is already complete.
New York is looking into the project right now.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight wagons.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the 17 State Ministrys of Transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not only have advocates.
In Nevada, where a device recently equipped with about 50 cars of volunteers, drivers were concerned by the fact that the government was able to monitor each movement.
“Women related to the monitoring of the Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, which leads the strategy management and operation to the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the U.S. civil liberties union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-time tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand into the register of daily exits and arrivals of individuals.
Needless is one of those several states that are trying to find available technology that would enable the state to monitor how many kilometres of the vehicle will go, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
The hunt for such technology has brought some state agencies to small companies in California called True Mileage (real high distance).
This company was originally not involved in the action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging insurance market with legal liability, where drivers would pay based on how much traffic they were in.
But this device, which tries, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using modem.
“People will be more willing to do it if you do not follow their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
A number of big mistakes appeared in some of these pilot programs.
They are much cheaper and less touching ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities, and instead they decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of taken kilometres of all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudential public will come to this concept if the equipment is more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to make it possible to pay fees at parking hours to provide insurance according to the used kilometres and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” says the city project document.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying a kilometer are not just a major problem.
The officials at the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Committee say that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing the gas tax.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on the driver of hybrids or other vehicles that do not use many fuels so that they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you need to take aspirin in richly," said Randy Rentschler, Head of the Committee on Law and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The ČSSD negotiates Saturday.
Social democracy is sore, human beings and grandmothers are talking and preparing a common approach.
If the social democrats, within a few weeks, meet the negotiating table with perfectly played partners, who will put on the table a finished list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD ambassadors will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or gush the drilling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, four days later, when he was carried on a wave of sympathy, he first hit.
Yesterday, he was unable to control the political system and, most importantly, force a convicted liar to resign.
The confirmed negotiator behind the party is only him, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (TEC).
I apologized to the gremy members and now to the citizens.
She's not supposed to lie, not be in her personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the negotiations.
He said he didn't lie at the post of First Vice-President.
"I will give my decision on 10 November to the ÚVV," said Haskeh.
Mr Zdenek Šromach and Head of the Member State club Jerome Tejc spoke similarly to the vice-president of ČSSD.
However, he noted that he was elected only two days ago.
The two Members then declared that they would do everything to make 50 members of the ČSSD Club sound one voice.
"I am a member of the ČSSD for 15 years, I have always been loyal to her brand and respected the decision of the party's authorities."
Or another lie on the direct transmission.
Or did he forget, at the call to Saturday's resignation and its elimination from the negotiating team, that August's ÚVVV's 57 percent took place, that Bohuslav Sobotka is a candidate for the opening party?
The head of the ČSSD, however, made a powerful army of enemies by calling the ÚVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with lots of different gossip and fems, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Sobotk's political careers.
It's going to be heavily washed dirty underwear, signs of a dark alliance between the Carbonaron Zdeněk Bakalou and the Sobotka wing.
He will discuss the friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the powerful lawyer Radek Pokorný.
They develop disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The words of the Ostrava Mayor and Sobotk allies of Peter Kajnar are: "Chart 77, I have signed to prevent the country from taking control of idiots."
If the ÚVV met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will put their heads in ashes and stay.
And now the winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The pieces of his mouth indicate a tiny smile, and then just deep breaths: "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complex, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what was in last week's Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What's going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, with regard to the provision of information on essential things no longer so much.
Maybe we've been searching for three months to deliver to us, how officially individual villages will be marked, so that we can do a whole series of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They keep communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic Village being built already?
But it's no longer a catastrophic condition.
We walked through empty rooms a month ago.
Happily, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors finished?
Just basic concrete, so that was a condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that after we get there on January 26th as front, there's still gonna feel glue there.
And if they don't, what will they do?
President Putin would have hunted the military down there?
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
Just so it wouldn't be that the Olympic Village = the Podumkin village.
Rather, they are likely to fail, for example, to adjust their travels, to make no details.
Maybe they'll have their way in such a state that we're gonna have to take girls from London's games with us.
But I'm sure they'll work things out.
How many Czech athletes could we go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, this number is changing.
Maybe the rudders will be on the three of them that went out.
Also, no one has to doubt Martina Sáblík's speed skater, but otherwise it's in development.
Do you still have a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should go there on January 26th.
We know how the houses will look in the Olympic village.
We even measured some things by metro, so that we don't just trust sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do one hundred days before the Olympics?
I'm getting ready for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the ecological olympiad, he's got a giant secret puzzle going on.
The fans of winter sports are already cutting meters until the opening of the Sochi Olympic Games, others looking for more and more fears.
The Russian Olympics, when they begin in February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be unable to fulfill the promise that the preparation and performance of the games will not be affected by nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed for four months.
After the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high, Canadian game in the history of the Olympics as being the most environmentally-friendly one.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to set up a game with "zero waste", has long ago taken over.
Reporters of the AP Agency last week discovered a giant fold of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, the landfill of complete building material, tyres, canisters and insulating foam found in August ecologically, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities with the rocks and the dump disappeared.
Just for a little while.
Last week, the reporters saw a puzzle of the size of three football courses.
She is not the only one in the area of such places, he described the British letter The Times.
There are Russian railways working on the site, a state monopoly, which builds about sixty-six-meter journey between Sochi Airport and the Sochi Sports Department.
The company, which had already counted 280 billion rubles, has led one of the nearby Putin co-workers Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, railways defended that someone from subcontractors founded the dump.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the people of Ahštyr around the village for three months now, on day and night, trucks run full of waste material.
According to experts, waste threatens to contaminated the local river Mzymt, other streams, and ultimately the Black Sea.
"The water from here is contaminated by Soviet water springs for the next 10 to 15 years," said Vladimir Kimajev of EWNC, British letter from EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organising Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: Games in Sochi will cost 51 billion dollars, while summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 went to 43 billion.
The London London Games cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver nine billions.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns, if eventually there will be enough snow, there has also been reports that during work at the exhibition of sports and infrastructure, human rights are not respected.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on the protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers struggle with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are preparing to support the Russian gays on the Olympics.
Young couple matured in living with their parents, the new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japan studio Tai and Associations received as an assignment to design a house on a parcele, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the property itself is somewhat considered.
The demand also meant that there will be two generations in the house that would like to live together, but each one should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed an extra office.
The house stands at the corner of two streets and on a slightly moving property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"When we made the proposal, we respected family unions, history and memories connected to the place."
"The three different functions of the house are several ways connected through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy," explains the designers.
Parents' household is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, with family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognized from the outside, because they differ with different final modifications of the facade.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been drawn up using boards from boards, part where the office is, is left white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glassy, which makes the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The parents' household, the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior connection with the exterior is highlighted by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to remain in the living room.
A kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house in the main entrance to the hall, and from there they climb up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant of the house's interior.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
That's exactly what the architects tried to separate the house from others and print something unique.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, a dining room and a living room together.
From the terrace it divides only the glass wall with the sliding door.
Living zone with dining area and kitchen parts in the home of young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo bay.
The office itself in the highest floor is captured in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enter the house by the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall and then climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, this is for Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly invited open letters of students, educators and the management of secondary and higher schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from election campaigns performed by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to lecture the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the election period, even received a retribution in the form of a failure to attend the national festival of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school leaders who have not been so brave and visit Miloš Zeman: High Technical University in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy promotion at universities.
A newly elected Member for ODS, Dean Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to withdraw from his academic function and, moreover, seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, this is not really the same as if you were, for example, to remain mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to include yourself with ČSSD leaders who are simultaneously calling on the function of Members and Manager and as well as they will degrade both professions?
That's what you tell people that they can handle both of these demanding left functions.
I know, there is an example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several tens of functions at once.
But I don't think that's exactly the example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferd to leave the parliamentary post in order to fully devote herself to the city's leadership.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean function is that you will violate the apoliticity of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
Management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current action on both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help your school without being thanked.
I think your students will have a similar view of me and rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters in the next elections count on you.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry doesn't add it.
More than a thousand tons of sour greens want to be produced in Slovakia's Fruity Kunovice, which belongs to Hamé's food group.
The season began here in October and will last for about six months.
Healthy delicacy since 1925 has been making traditional productions, i.e. walking directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our worker found a shift of nearly 10 feet [10 km] route.
Each of the ten tanks contains 15 to 30 tons of greens, the filling of one takes three shifts," said the director of the plant Slovenská Fruta David Klalobza.
The green bodies are entering the company's premises directly from their fields farmers mainly from Ostrožska and Břeclavska.
Then the Fruta employees clean the vegetables, remove the furrows and throw them into the groves.
From here, already cut greens fall into swimming pools with a depth of six metres, in which hookers, dressed in white clothes and shavings, are tirelessly worked.
That's how they drain unwanted air.
The last broken layer of the cabbage will be covered with a sail and burdened with water.
"An evil turkey then breaks down six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation aids," Klobek stressed.
Natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers sleep through salt and cumin.
The evils after extraction are pushed into a filling line.
It is packed in a sweet, sweet, easy-to-use bag or jar and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sour herbs mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a snitch from American intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about his activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Sträbel met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and treated with him on the opportunity to testify in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who handed over to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the outcome of my efforts has been manifestly positive, my government continues to act as a opposition to the opposition and tries to criminalise political speeches with heavy actions that do not give room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to withdraw charges on crimes against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to allow it.”
The tensions between the US and Germany began to rise when there was a claim that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who runs the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness, “without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the US,” that should be done.
Mr Sträbel, Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, published on his twitter paper a photo with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safe” there, said a member of Parliament.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a rough and persevering campaign associated with persecution, which forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the whole and high school officials, including in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unreasonable public-service monitoring system.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, “although the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Killing us sorry, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khomérs are fighting.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Government of the Red Khmers, which was based in 1975 to 1979 on the mixture of Maoism and nationalism, they lost their lives due to exhaustion, hunger, sickness, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, i.e. at least a quarter of the then population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Sampan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Sampan fought by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and did not know what the true extent of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understand everything and thus intervene and correct the situation," said Khieu Samphan in the judgment on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Red Khmers to "take people wrongly or kill them to deny them food or to commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I wish to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people," he said.
The fifth-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, said Agent AFP can't accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"One wants to be released from guilt."
"She doesn't care about another," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmers are worse than monsters."
He was also supposed to stand in court with the Ieng Sara Red Army regime, which died in March this year.
His wife Ieng Thirith, the then Minister of Social Affairs, found the court in September 2012 an incompetent trial for dementia.
Leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge manual luggage
Frontier Airlines plans, during its years, to charge up to USD 100 for placing the hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to 100 USD for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in their notification on Wednesday they said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new load for the hand luggage applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so the small luggage under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier says he will charge $25 if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers with the payment will wait until the gate entrance.
Frontier Kate O'Malley spokesperson said that the barn fee should encourage passengers to take up their fees.
"We would not like to choose this fee," she said.
Air companies started charging first and second luggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and clali into hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no place in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach travelers to take fewer things aboard.
O'malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most faithful customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be charged.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier’s gate can bring a luggage for which he will not pay anything while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'malley said that the website and the check-in procedures will be adapted to ensure that passengers receive a fee before their arrival at the gate.
The new fee for Frontier’s hand luggage will not be valid until summer, but the date has not been set yet.
Passengers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another fee for luggage as a sign of the fact that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them didn't pay for delivery charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed later.
The only company with such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely follows additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, Spirit estimated that the charge for the hand luggage will be USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, was recently flying with Spirit and was wondering what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with the unusual fee of Spirit for hand luggage.
"It was the most recent thing I've seen on the plane in my air career," he said.
I thought I'd see the gateside squeezing teeth and fights.
The plane was full, he said, "and the arrival took place in a jig."
The Frontier will also apply the coffee, tea, soda and juice fees after the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be added for free.
Water will continue to be given for free.
In 2008 US Airways attempted to introduce charges for beverages, but after passengers’ complaints seven months later, and no other significant airline was able to imitate it.
The last move to Frontier to charge delivery luggage if passengers do not purchase flights directly from this airline, it is her last effort to direct customers directly to your website.
The airline pays online travel dealers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September she started giving customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half a mile in the frame of loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut off the reward for a loaded mile to 25 percent of the way.
So the journey with Frontier 1000 miles purchased through the Internet travel agency means the reward of 250 miles.
The customers also allow the company to choose its seat in advance only if the purchase is carried out directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver, but her business starts to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results presented in the middle of the company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
Republic also tries to solve Frontier’s financial problems by selling this airline.
For the fall of the NSA website, it does not charge hackers, but “inside error”
The National Security Agency said last Friday that her website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of the hack attack, as some of them said on the Internet.
"NSA.gov's orders were not accessible for hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be eliminated during this evening.
The claim that the accident was caused by the attack of DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Previously this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the pages are still unavailable for some users.
Former NSA spokesperson, ABC News, said that the Agency's internal sensitive network was not threatened.
A spokesperson said that no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hackers on the Internet claimed to be responsible for removing the NSA's websites through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until servers are overloaded and the website falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Former NSA super-secret agency, once acquired a nickname No such agency, has become the centre of public attention and target of squeezing the classified NSA files from the agency in recent months and their disillusionment to the former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency fuelled earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber surgery.
Bombardier’s profit fell due to a drop in supply and order
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15 % decrease in net profit, which is due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
The Bombardier based in Montreal also published no data on the air test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to launch the commercial operation from next September.
After the launch of the test flight about a month ago and a half of the plane flew only three times, the question arises whether the test phase progresses well.
The results did not fill the estimates and shares at the stock exchange in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen's bank analyst reduced the rating from “Higher return” to “sector performance” with the expectation that a stock exchange would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While less aircraft deliveries were expected to increase, we were significantly disappointed in the transport margin," Doerksen said.
With the way the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from the Ceries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we expect the market to grow on this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are being fought into the lower market area now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after a month delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of airline orders is modest 177 because the potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight so that they can verify the company's claims on low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that Bombardier would achieve its 300 binding orders when putting the first aircraft into commercial use.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program was being followed by a plan.
"The test plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said during the conference call and noted that the testing on the ground and software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Each producer plans them differently.
We decided to attend the first years and then focus on updates and that's what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the weeks to come and others not long thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries flight 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims to have assessed its plan for putting the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the months to come.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although consistent with the Bombardier's internal plan – will probably strengthen our view that putting into service will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
Out of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier in the third quarter of September fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share.
Fixed yields per share remained unchanged to 9 cents.
The turnover fell marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer stated that, compared to 57 aircraft, he had supplied only 45 aircraft during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the air division accounted for at 30 September 32.9 billion, which did not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were consistent with our prospects, but low orders income and the overall state of the market failed us," Beaudoin said.
Shipping in the aviation industry has fallen 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, stated that the return in this division grew by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders said that new perspectives will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google Patrick Pichette's financial manager, decreased by 8.5 percent on Thursday afternoon, to USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier, notified on Thursday a 10% drop in quarterly profit.
The lawyer depends on the cocaine he warned the mob in front of the police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transfer information to the king of the underworld of Neil Scarbrough.
The attorney was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
He was afraid that his drug addiction would come out, sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, to the head of the Underworld of Neil Scarbrough to provide sensitive information on the investigation of his drug smuggling activities.
A lawyer whose nickname was “Bash” and who was celebrated as the best attorney of crime was after the police follow-up to Scarborough, whom he represented in the previous drug proceedings, was arrested at home in 2011.
The police saw Sarborough (32) leaving at the law house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law firm, three coke bags.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drugs.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he attempted to actively obtain information on the arrest of two men for the benefit of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were followed at that time in the context of a large investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police arrested heroin and cocaine over a series of raids worth approximately GBP 1.5 million together with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 were arrested in prison together with them.
Ditta (42) passed on information to criminals from fear of coming to his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, has experienced a shameful moment in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when, after three weeks of trial, he was found guilty of preventing the exercise of justice in two cases.
During the previous hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall was after the Scarborough police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him put his drugs about 60 percent under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
After that, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at a football stadium at Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park, in a regular phone interview.
The lawyer came home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between them.
In court, it was said that there were traces of class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, and Ditta was a “legal user of cocaine”.
Ditta was arrested later, but the use of cocaine denied, and he said he was talking to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and he argued that their conversation fell into "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all arrested and his hair samples were taken away.
In police interrogation, he said he was operating both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients visited him at home because of their work affairs.
However, the Court heard that after the key arrests he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom had previously been represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is aware that he must not violate a law than a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of being abused by his legal representative and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were clearly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it's far beyond the limits of the common legal-client relationship.
The police investigation had as much as possible to allow them to continue their crime.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, he disrespected her.
With certain clients, he got too close, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disturbed.
Ditta rejected the offense and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to give Mr Scarborough information, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself in the criminal field when he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organised crime groups that gave him the task of gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and encourage confidence in the public and the sense that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The Unit for Serious and Organised Crimes in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, which has also been condemned in three cases of possession of cocaine and now for preventing the execution of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of collaborating in order to supply heroin, cocaine and hemp.
Another thirty-five people involved in trading have been imprisoned in total for 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website Ditta held an online conversation in which he said that his dream job would be legally representing clients from the bloc of death in America, as a guest for dinner would like Mohammed Ali and as motivation for work said inequality.
He was discussing government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now, John Kasal's people have sent against Babiš.
In elections, the human population gained 14 Members, i.e. only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the ANO.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already begun to guess the outlines of possible coalitions, has Jan Kasala - a man who, for the people, has failed the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
I guess this time it will remind the first negotiations in 1992 when ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experiences were then minimal," estimates Kasal, how talks would develop this year.
Kenya's press rebelled with controversial media law
"This is a scary report and it is necessary to ask what Parliament will prevent Parliament from simply washing away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper considering the draft law as anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be assumed because it is the extended hands of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising harm the position of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to Members," he said.
According to the Star magazine, the bill actually gives the government “full control over the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “disrupted a hard hit” and criticize the bill as “reasonable”.
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately after the Islamic shooter's shining attack in Westgate shopping center.
The anger of the authorities turned to the Kenyan media when she sent out the security footage on which the soldiers would send a shop with luxury goods on the scene of the attack.
The police director responded by calling on two journalists and a media worker to question, but the call was later withdrawn after the media pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be punished up to 20 million Chinese shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of “deducting from the list” or can be denied official press accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator unless the penalty is paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is also one fine enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also noted that these measures may have a devastating impact on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen” wrote a journalist of the Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Kenyan media as a key source of the mutual control and balance system in public life.
“When we leave it in the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and cast us back to hunt and collection,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticisms in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the abolition of cuts imposed by the National Pay Agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532 000 undeserved shillings per month, which thus rank to the highest in the world.
They have to merge, they know the young Czechs.
Most of them have no idea what interest they have
Still more Czechs put their money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in the region’s savings.
The most money is set aside by the Rakusheans, who will savings monthly on average EUR 181.
A little more than the Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This results from a survey of the Erste Savings Barometer Group in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is improving, and two-thirds of the questions are planning to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of the list of sequencers, in Romania and Serbia people still use the savings products very little.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, is going to burn at home under a pillow.
In the home this year, there were increasing numbers of those who would save more money monthly.
Even last year, a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent spent each month on various kinds of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly yield in year-to-year comparison however slightly fell to CZK 2078.
Pension insurance is the biggest hit between savings products.
This favours 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, there is a decrease in the level of building savings, and there has also been a significant fall in interest for investment funds compared to last year.
They're only using 16 percent of respondents, while it was nearly a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to rely, most of them do not know the yields of individual products.
Of course, young people up to 30 years don't know how their money is damaged.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the yields of its saved money has an oldest group of questions, among people over 50 years is 73 percent of those asked.
In the international comparison of Erste Czechs, 44 percent of people regularly use online banking.
They are followed by Slovaks and Rakushanes with a 12-per cent distance.
The UN celebrates the new objectives of the fight against poverty
The United Nations begins to work urgently on a new set of objectives that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (DGs) that were introduced 12 years ago in order to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the 'sustainable development objectives' to replace the MDG, which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary General, Mr Ki-mun, said overnight at the summit that it is now time to "invite yourself over national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the SDGs' general objective of sustainable development," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Programme.
I will make every effort to complete the mandate granted to me by the Member States and implement our vision for sustainable development objectives, which put forward the success of the MDG.
Mosambik security concerns escalate due to a conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samory Machely, the Mosambian Founder's President, thousands of people were gathered in the centre of Maputa to call for peaceful slogans on rare public demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
With fear of the future of her country, the company's dress was replaced by a t-shirt decorated with the inscription "We require security" in Portuguese and joined on Thursday to the crowd in the Town of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks, nearly daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo parties came about one of the worst struggles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an unfamiliar rebel movement, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodes and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa, within the framework of efforts to destabilize the independent government of this country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, the opposition party became a opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict will be restored in the country, but recent events will tell foreign investors and locals.
The stake is a rapidly growing economy, as the discoveries of large coastal reserves of oil and coal in the northwest can bring companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and American Anadarko, more than 50 billion dollars to invest in the next few years.
The ruling party of Frelio, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the resulting tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government raised recent conflicts by launching an attack on their members' province in Sofala, the traditional ban of the Renamo Party.
The violent attack of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked Renamo's base and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said Renamo Fernando Mazanga spokesperson for the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for launching conflicts because they said they attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was trying to ease his instability.
Mr Guebuza said in the middle of the French press office AFP said that Mr. Dhlakam saw himself as a “stacker” who wanted to use “anything in his power left to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government.”
Both Frelma and Renamo are saying they want to avoid the war.
However, fear increased when the words of Mr Mazangy were quoted, that Renamo's party departs from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT letter said that he meant that the Frelio party no longer respects the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous interviews between these parties have done little to mitigate tension between these parties, which are smothered by a series of traits this year.
It is a charm between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the teacher at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, nor is one of them prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, who sought electoral change, has already expressed its view that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to gain benefits and financial gains from government.
Renamo's election share has declined since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mosambik movement (DHM), which was founded by former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, who ends the second term of office next year, wants to destroy this country's democracy.
"The democratic system of more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to let the presidential office go," Mazanga said.
It's unclear what Renamo's options are, but he's done a disruptive terrorist attack on a police station and on a vehicle on a key road between north and south.
Most of the attacks occurred in the province of Sofa, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the town of Beira is, a port to which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railroad for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question whether Renamo would bring his threat back.
Renamo wanted to “warning the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent flooding of kidnappings.
“People think that responsibility for the future of the country is exclusively borne by the government and the President and that he is supposed to be the one to find solutions to problems” he says.
Omar Sultuane's demonist says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelio, people just want peace again, want to have free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for a Way of Life," says the author.
The stories of Thór can show that “the gross power cannot be equal to intelligent lsivities,” while artusov legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myth would be "to teach at school too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene", said Crossley-Holland, who pleads for a careful selection of works of the corresponding age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk works are already part of education," he said.
I've been plotting this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are in the entangled tales of “the right hand” messages for children as “the switch.”
Crossley-Holland, who has translated the Beowulf epos and also writes the Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Journal, says: “You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them for yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between the adult author writing adults and an adult author writing for children is a feeling of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be suspicious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
Brno Starárna takes visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first sight, it is obvious that the Great Planetarium Hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can burrow into new comfortable seats, and the projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has arrived above their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order for the image to be perfect, there are other smaller projectors scattered after the OR.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"There are 20 computers that generate the painting," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Starárny.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not overlap, but give complete impression.
"The work of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than on classic personal computers," said the technicians from the Starship Tomáš Hladík.
The digitium can explore an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or ocean bottom.
The audience will be so enlightened in the middle of space or the brain of man.
Another similar device is nearest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
Management of the constellation is planning to project purchased shows as well as its own production in the hall.
Since Saturday, there's two shows on the program.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about space training, fly out into space, start at centrifuge, then see how demanding astronauts are facing space.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose petrobarial inhabitants lived peaceful lives until the explosion of the nearby volcano occurred.
The entire digitium cost about 50 million crowns, which were paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
Smaller amounts also contributed to the city of Brno and the starry of its budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital system followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the starry went through two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30 000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 INJECTS!
We know where they want you to go!
Last November, an analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4300 were published in daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the internet.
The internet therefore becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Even in 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it reached about 60 percent.
job placements, according to analysis, reflect significantly the current situation on the labour market.
For example, it may be a simple comparison between the number of advertisements published during the economic prosperity period and the time of the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 2,900 advertisements were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of work positions on the Internet is more targeted, especially a more qualified professional group.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the working ones, said Pavlín Happy analysis author.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet there were leading ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business managers was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representations are mainly serviceable and working professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through advertising offers.
Another monitored area included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was expressed in three percent of ads, on the internet at 37 percent.
Only two percent of employers' ads required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Entitlements to 'calculation' appeared in 40 percent of ads (day printing in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was requested at 54 percent of ads.
Practice requirements shall be linked to qualified professions.
This includes mainly the production manager and other leading workers.
For working professions it is mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical instruments, Jiří Tillner added the author of the study.
The employees also state in half of their ads the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most often required skills, communication skills have been demonstrated in the first place in the advertisement for a long time.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, accountability, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is a place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the organist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre Theatre Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the gathered people jokes by way of an interview.
Fay's innovation spread through the New York comedy festival over the years.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founded by the institution of solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful at the rate that they were too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (to become heroes), the annual musical beneficial performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform in addition to others.
Just like he spread this festival, the world of comedy has spread.
Several commissions taking part in this year's festival came from unusual channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got high with his sistom (speakable “League” on a fantastic-football theme on the FXX) and now has his own comedy show at the Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recretion” program, but most was famous for the fast spreading series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoots on” (cans Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young commies with clearly identifiable voices (orally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, scarlet, race-oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest moves in the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comet, but he became a successful television director and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he held a TV Land show called “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting is held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work”, said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he's walking through a alley between two buildings sometimes, and he's like, man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell further to $96 for the barrel
The price of oil continued to decrease on Friday, as concerns about high stocks was considered by the report which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-resulting manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December supplies fell by $14 to $96.24 in the European electronic trading at the New York Stock Exchange during the late morning.
On Thursday, 39 cents were dropped, and for October, it became 5.8 percent.
Rich stocks of oil last week have made a price burden.
The Ministry of Energy said Wednesday that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production gave rise to an incentive for greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to increase after the previous two weak decades in the third quarter to 7.8%.
Ropa Brent, an indicator for the international oil used also by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel.
No way, Mr. Hask.
We have a unique way to tell politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Hashek to be rid of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so disappearing.
Martin Hašek is interested in the promise he made, but everyone and politics must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and very much to consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr Babiš also has the material, but it is a question whether it is a politician).
The programme promoted by a liar is untrustable.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he leaves in politics.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you didn't just lie -- here you see how difficult it is with lying, you'll leave politics yourself as a man.
The people then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and assumes his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as an unsustainable weakness, whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud to be a bad person or a life-long skket.
It may seem to you that it is unjust when I address you only, but you are the leader and they are just confused sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to get your ears down for a while, regroup your ears, take the shame off, and then attack them again, but they're being grounded or betrayed.
You are, I repeat, leader, alpha male in your eyes, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
Court of First Instance blocked regulations concerning the detention and search of persons by police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the court's order requiring changes in the program to stop and search persons in the police department in New York and the judge called the case off.
The second American appeal court has said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision will be postponed until the decision on the appeal the city has given.
The judge decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution so that it had implemented its program of stopping and asking people.
The city of her conclusions and her amending regulation were attacked, including the decision to allocate supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday arguments for the required postponement.
The Court of Appeal said that the Judge must be withdrawn because he had entered into a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge, according to the request to avoid the dissenting, partly because of a series of talks with the media and a public statement which he openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people when they were wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics in their agenda of stopping and searching persons.
It has established independent supervision to monitor the main changes including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and to establish the launch of a pilot programme for testing body-based cameras in certain areas where the most frequent stop-up of persons occurs.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral justification for recall of the city is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form of stopping and searching for people for about a number of decades, but the tours recorded under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to the record number 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was about black people and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were minority members, registered a lawsuit which had become a case of group action.
The advocates of the changes in the detention and search programme by the police department in the NY argue that changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and efficiency of the police department and may affect how they use other police departments.
The Opponents claim that the changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that they are wasting money, but they will not solve a broader problem when the police department is under pressure after the last decade has reduced its numbers by a few thousand people.
The judge noted that she had not completed the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional but reforming the way in which the inspections of the police department in NY were introduced.
Five shopping centres deal with low attendance
This is derived from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle's real estate consulting information.
In Prague Bohnech, the public trade center of Krakow is opening up, it will be 19. Prague shopping center.
There are now 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsettling performance is about 20 percent medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large center towards the site and bad layouts, i.e. too much pater or complicated and inexplicable passage arrangement, or dead places of center," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of the department of retail properties, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi is facing about five shopping centers with low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents, or market survival at a given location.
Some projects opened almost fully, but their results were largely unsatisfactory.
Today, customers are rather conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping center must do more to attract its customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupation of shopping centres is generally stable, even for some centers, because the tenants were willing to discount from rent in the crisis and sell some units.
"But it is true that recently some projects that are not fully occupied and the average occupation thus decrease (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)" added Soták.
Business centres opened in the past two years are very slow on the market, according to Sylvie Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see an area for the construction of a project to serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects called 'convinity centres', focused on the purchase and service of daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity,' said Samadi.
According to Sotak, there is also room for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
Both small 'service' centres and large projects in Prague or medium-sized projects, or expanding in regional cities.
"Casts like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, he sees the area for the prepared business center in the Winner's Square, and he believes they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí.
"Intensive expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expand into smaller cities for favourable rent and operating costs, space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, respectively reconstruction such as reconstruction of department store houses Prior, which benefit from a good location," said Dita Kubanková from DTZ.
90 modern shopping centres are currently located in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross rental areas.
The quarter of all these shopping centres is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them in Prague, results from Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France is about 50 square meters [50 sq m] per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tips
The former News editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of "tuning himself on the phone, tracking and confrontation" to confirm the underwater tip on the love relationship to which the then minister inside Charles Clarke was to be involved.
Deputy Andrew Edis in Old Bailey's trial said that the News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special consulting” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned a private investigator named Glenn Mulcaire to hack Paulby's voice box and penetrate her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
“The National Representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now a NotW editor, is not a person who stands outside the house and hopes that people will catch outside, but a man who likes to push stories to see what they say," said Mr.Edis.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: hacking into a phone, tracking and confronting.
Editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The love couple Clarke was first captured by the NotW News Department when the source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told: "You're just wasting time, that's with Charles."
A recording with voice messages taken from her phone at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projections".
During Mrs. Pawlby's investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about Paulby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup watched over Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on 18 June 2005 saying: “I got a story that we are about to publish tomorrow and which I would love to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as with other important personalities, including former Home Secretary David Blukett.
At the court on Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for his love relationship with a married woman, while he himself was seeing a co-indicted Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied teaming with other people to make their calls between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to getting on the phone.
The detection of NSA increases the state's social paranoia of State monitoring
One day at the end of August, the German police helicopter squeezed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Institute (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to establish photographs of the roof of the American pre-siding patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbanka.
The German media claims that the BfV was hoping that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and that this action launched an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again again in September, insisted that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence opportunities "to steal business secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant from his co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of classified monitoring by the United States, the European Government and leading businessmen no longer know if they should believe in the words of the Directors.
After reports that the US National Security Agency carried out a spy in Brazil's oil company and gained access to data with which US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved general paranoia on State monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came up with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged for, like, ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly potential targets as well as leading businessmen.
Snowden transparencyd intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the consulting service EY, German companies believe that, as regards industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much a risk as China.
But there is no evidence that the United States has transferred trade secrets to its own company throughout the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden.
Politicians expressed their concerns that the EU lacked certain skills in the area of IT and the Internet and said that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
The German Parliament is calling on the votes that we should produce German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them up slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is touched, from coal to car and farmer.
Everything except IT industry.
The scope and technical development of American spy agencies revealed by Snowden is for some companies who have so far thought that China's greatest threat of surveillance is still shocking.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have become more aware that the data stored in the US fall under those jurisdictions and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey carried out by the trading community Cloud security alliance about 10 percent of non-American members after the discovery of the US Prism program for data downloading, the plans to use a cloud service provider based in the US were cancelled.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German vacuum agents argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is happening, it's not a surprise.
It's always been done.
"This has been a fundamental topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the Agrochemical Company BASF.
Americans carry out spying on us at business and industrial level, just like we do espionage on them because it is our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have done so that they do not, where appropriate, confer an advantage on the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking free USB disk memory at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unclear.
Ulrich Hackenberg, director of the Audi Board, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before the meeting of the Board of Directors so that they can not be used as a listening device.
The German office of BfV advises leaders to consider whether to use easy prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads due to the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
The prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market leaders in their specific areas.
“The small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access,” warns BfV in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington's letter, U.S. National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France next to Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators involved in the hacking business for economic intelligence, right behind China.
The board member in the German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage is concerned, “they are the worst of the French.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency for DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “Services know that all countries, even though they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
Parents of an underage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a wet fighting spirit in the gym of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck on January 11, behind the tribunes at the high school gym where he went.
The Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the 17-year-old family rejects it.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered”, said FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff declared it.
"They believe it contradicts logic, physical laws and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's supposed to be what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to their bodies in a bag," he said.
On Thursday, Deputy Secretary Michael Moore said he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was cause of death?
Was his death a consequence of the crime?
stated Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
The facts will be watched wherever I'm going.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a "deployment".
The second autopsy, however, stated another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death for a criminal investigation order or violation of civil rights, he will ask the FBI and his execution.
The deputy sheriff's office from Lowndes District was not available immediately on Thursday for any comment.
The South Georgie judge ordered authorities to make all the videos of surveillance cameras available at the centre of the authorities to be inspected by the investigators.
Young parents hope that the videos will contain a trace leading to the discovery of their son’s death.
CDC Centre issued a directive for schools on allergy in children
The Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of directives to help children with food allergy at school.
This is the first set of directives that the US government has issued, and this is because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The CDC centre found that the incidence of food allergy in children rose by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directives contain information for schools on how the teacher congregation and staff are aware of child allergy to foods and how to react to an allergic reaction, if it occurs, to respond.
Schools are also recommended to have a adrenaline available – the most commonly used automatic EpiPen injector is to be able to respond to potentially dangerous life hypersensitivity.
The state legislators recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's banging my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "I know my tongue".
Parents of intersexual children can choose “definite sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise third sex in children born with non-unique sex.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to men or women's sex.
The new law from parents does not require that any sex be introduced for such children, and it allows them to mention gender on their birth certificates as “undetermined” or “unspecific”.
The law is designed to stop pushing parents to step up surgery with their child to determine sex and fight against discrimination against people who are intersexual.
A intersexual person, according to the BBC, after many years, said: “I am neither man nor woman nor woman.”
I'm going to stay the satin created by doctors, stimulated and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, 2,000 children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (e.g. ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available and to identify them instead of waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination problems, said that the new German law “is like a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not do so," he said.
A gender determination can be performed without an operation and then it can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowing how sexuality is developed in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to sex, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characterists such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and sexual function, or in structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the field of work, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark in official documents male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first “responsible” person when she won a judicial appeal so that she could keep her status “indefinite” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports other than M (man) and F (woman) will have a third mark, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, reports on France 24 are still controversial.
In 2011, tens of French legislators from this heavily Catholic country signed petitions for removing the gender theory from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online has also been defined against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is attached to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn over two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn woman in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see that she would share sex with the children at birth.
“Racialism itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she commented on the web pages relating to parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex called hermaphrodites, depending on the handsome Greek who had dual sex.
And for about ten years back, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could delete and transform.
But now many question the ethical basis for an operation with sexuality being a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes decide wrongly because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up because of their sex.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to treat children with non-unique sex was presented by Dr John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who was convinced that sex was subject.
He created a new concept of “sponsibility” and argued that social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – were responsible for children’s genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or woman.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the wrongly executed circumcised, recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed also his testicles and raised as a girl.
"Media presented this case as a successful conversion, but the fact was different," Drescher said.
When the boys were 15 years old, he got reoperated into a boy and married to a woman.
In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "tento model use" to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared to be "consistection with the result".
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but a unique sex thing.
Doctors weren't sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man, he could never live a "satisfaction life".
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed by the external organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
In 12 years, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to vagina plastic at 18.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After birth, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop properly his sexual function.
After learning the truth, he changed back to men, took doses of testosterone and had his breast removed,
The operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Advocates legal group for an informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law is called for the collection and stigmats.
“A lot of activists are concerned that the German law will achieve the promotion of their parents to make quick decisions and choose “negligious” children,” she said.
We're afraid it'll be encouraging to intervene.
We believe it is better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally confesses, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because she “lets an adult to choose to be included in a third sex.”
"Adults should be able to make their own decision about a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not seduce at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barazz, a chest radioologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that the German law “will divide powers” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called insensitive to androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's features have evolved.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and ovaries.
Now she's 29 years old, Katie's married, and she works as an intern in child psychiatry in Pennsylvania.
Although infernal, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and think it over and give them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this respect everything is fine – you bring up your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you enjoy it.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
“This brings the opportunity to engage in decisions and children and removes anxiety that the parents tie down because they do not know that they are doing the right thing” she said.
In the end, the child will decide what sex he makes more of – and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
He threatened to burn him with his own family!
The tension grew, fear grew.
The man started threatening to set the house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols went to the scene in the vicinity, as well as a team of firemen from Mladá Boleslav and a team of voluntary firemen.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to talk to his irrational behavior at the scene.
The man still threatened to set the house on fire.
So at home, an intervention force had to enter into the house, which had disabled the men and tied them up.
The aggressor then finished investigating at the Mladoboleslav hospital from which he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic rescue station.
In the end, the firemen slept with gas in the house with sorbent, which later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
He didn't go to the police negotiator, so the squad went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden as Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton for the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the impatiently anticipated book about the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine got a copy of the incoming book and announced on Thursday evening that top co-workers held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to determine whether depriving Biden would help to revive Obama's pale hope of re-electation.
According to the Times National Politician, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts made by officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House Leader, Bill Daley, to measure what effect on elections should move the former Foreign Minister Clinton to the post of Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly monitored secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few presidents of the nearest advisers – including Daley, the former chief of Obama's campaign, Jim Messina, and former chief advisers at David Axelrod's White House and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was a representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to perform this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “Oama’s chances would not significantly increase.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, she confirmed that administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've done an intensive study of a number of things, and this was one of them," said Daley.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought: “Kristepane, what should we do?”
While Daley characterised research as a “till care”, Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-elect campaign was making small investments to see if this move was worth the election.
“The campaigns do not make up such money for choices and qualitative research if something is not really considered," Martin said to AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential mix of cards.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president had the potential change “was aware,” the former executive admitted that he was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double down” definitely did not answer the question whether the political probe had reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research he was trying to get Biden out of the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a world-renowned pamphlet.
The idea was when he read the specialist treatises about the jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemicalize the protein that caused the world.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – increases the level of pH in the protein and then causes radiation.
Chris says ice cream is glowing when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and that's why the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I'm delicious” (I lick me, I taste great), says: “It’s an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we’re at the beginning, so you get about GBP 200 for about 2 g of this substance.”
The white we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So how your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases, and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it in the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
He's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, 'cause the meddling is four times more expensive than gold.
So every dot costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his other product should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish to make invisible ice cream."
In fact, it's impossible because of the lom light caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up long and show up to the neighbors in disguise.
Today, I feel like I've become a scrooze.
It hasn't been candy in my apartment for two years, and it's probably not gonna be different this year.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
What I look forward to every time I look forward to is trends.
According to the NRF, it is expected that $6.9 billion of lost dollars will go to $1.2 billion in costumes.
This year is the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy food can be like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I'll bet the Daft Punk spacemen will reach our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, zombie, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I assume there's nothing wrong with going tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones for my pleasure.
In fact, Americans, according to the NRF, spend $330 million on costumes for animal lovers this year.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not wasting our time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kg Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds sweetties and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing report for 41 million students who, according to the U.S. Trade Department, are about to hit our fourth.
In fact, during Halloween, we'll buy, and believe me, we'll also conjure up 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Sugar Association, almost 16 thousand tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn chocolates.
That's a secret I never understood.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as the "Teror behind the wars" (The Horror behind the walls, which is, by the way, the real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (swipes, screams) and "The house of shoot" (The House of Shock).
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 haunted houses in the United States, which, according to American scary houses, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes the amazing photos you're squeezing fear and which will give your friend Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will take a look at the photo and post a comment like "the nice face".
And eventually a little something about pumpkins.
Already when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and cutting out pumpkin mirrors is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it since the baby.
Fortunately, for us the trend of "kids in pumpkin" began with Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up to cut out the sticks instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People Count Office, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lucern with a misty flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
Notified Land Rover Racing Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication devices.
The choice is improved brakes, a service package ensuring access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of vehicles between plants.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced competitors, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also achievable way to world class races.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and abroad, and that it will prepare contestants for hardness and reality of the Rally Raid race.
Development of the Defense Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a real exciting competition.
In February, Defender Challenge will offer the trainer and test day as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have early elections
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
A week after the last one in the interview for News.cz, he said that there is no other starting point, and every government is out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last that long," Karel Schwarzenberg said, "the lifetime of the starting term is estimated to be within two years.
With the objection that next voters hardly choose completely differently, they disagree: "I think it's going to be a little more balanced decision making."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could lose voters as this year in other elections (by 2010 he lost approximately 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that the early elections would be, the movement of ANO 2011 will strengthen Andreje Babiš.
Otherwise, Babish will lose himself according to Schwarzenberg.
The Turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, following a secret Latin meeting of the party's leadership, stated that he or Michal Hašek will remain in charge of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leaders of the democratic party how little guys go behind the head of the state to allow them to flip over."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was more sophisticated and intelligent."
"Because I've never seen anything so unspeakably wrong in my life," said the chairman of TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he met in the fight for the presidential function) he went: "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to take hold of the party."
The first laws have already been presented by TOP 09.
What's been the biggest election surprise for you personally?
The TOP 09 has already formally tabled its first legislative proposals in the House, including the Fark Registry of Contracts, which before the elections has been discussed by the House Committees, but with early elections it has fallen under the table.
The President of TOP 09 in an interview for the present.cz claims that such a speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 seems to prejudge similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO Martin Komárek movement accused TOP 09 in the electoral struggle that the idea of establishing a register of contracts "deducts" the ANO movement programme.
TOP 09 has now used the lead - it simply dusted the proposal that was already brought into the second chamber reading.
Fire forces have come to rescue the lost puppy, which has stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous outburst in a stonemelol
Captain Ruby ran away after a little car accident.
Three days later, a man who walked out of the dog saw him trapped in a fossil.
The firemen were lounging on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
Štěn was liberated by fire forces that came to free him after, in some way, he was stuck on a dangerous outpost in a stoneloof 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month cochranian Ruby ran away after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and three days he survived himself until he was released from a stone house on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit Stone in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to reconnect with Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After he ran away, when he got into a little accident, they warmly searched his lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, an early-warming boy named Ruby saw an outburst in a stone house 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Clekheaton's fire station was hurrying up to free Ruby, using him to pick up the cattle transport bag on the rock.
Andy Clayton's technical rescue team commander said, "The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and back.
He didn't move his eyebrow during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But now he's okay.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
The technical rescue team commander Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be very badly hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a visit, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration was fine.
Miss Halle of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was scared when I looked at a rescue event."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said that if he'd drained too much and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firemen have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they're all just huge.
Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.”
The firemen were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said that for Jagger's 2004 song “Old Habits die hard” she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he was running out on her.
She added: "That was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me."
In his statement on Thursday, Jagger (70) deputy said that the categoricals reject that he would ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's involved with someone else."
Perry was one of the welcome singers (a singer) who appeared at the Rolling Stones concert hall this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives Scots a choice
Next day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to stories of belt checks in Berwick and a barbed wire along Hadrian's val.
The truth is that Strathclyde has mentioned the possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as has been expected – this has not been reflected in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap charge for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scottishs.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And also so old that he became a digger, a new duck, that “independence means passport control”, I heard at least 40 years ago.
Still, one interesting thought is hiding in this bearded story.
Why should independent Scotland even expect to listen to Europe?
Why replace the London Hamster for the Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Besides Europe, dedicated resistance parties or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are affected by dedicated parties.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of Alternativa for Germany – founded in this year – came out of nowhere and has raised nearly five million votes in the blatant federal elections, making Bundestag essentially the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil, he was always opposed to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The responsibility dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the national economy’s convictions, has brought many people to the view that Europe’s project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments manage a high budget deficit – that was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates beneficial for the German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currencies, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending – which Germany encourages.
The current problems with budget and currency are a deeper cause of European low performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the code for supporting French and German companies to costs consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol as it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have seen in the Grongemouth case.
Not even any freeze pay in the world would reverse the collapse of the European petrochemical industry by cheap shale oil from the US.
As a result, there is a perturbing rebellion, especially in France, once the popular EU supporters.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument to keep Germany at its bottom and allow Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
But Paris no longer needs and settled its own economic policy in Europe, as a political legitimacy card, and left its own destiny to the consumption of the French economy.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Penová, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and has moved the ruling socialists to third place.
Fronta is now with 24% of the most popular party in France – a timely warning for British Labourists, that they cannot find that brushing right is automatically positive on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with his newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties succeed in these elections, which is likely to be a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
It seems to me that the growing anti-European feeling and the attitude against the common currency will be linked and the euro will be lost in due time.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of "European (supply) nations", the general de Gaulle has already preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project and reach the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left with Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also a possibility of informing Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would do well in Europe's relaxed arrangement, assuming it kept its own currency.
Working with other similarly-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, in fact, the most successful political movement that does not promote austerity in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition attitude towards the cuts it planned (and implemented) the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now opted for independence only to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early teens: Developed earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics have reached teenagers before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean that teenages are coming.
It has not been shown to be hormones or other chemicals
Experts claim that an outbreak of obesity may be one of the early teens.
Trend of earlier teens isn't so noticeable with boys.
Former rapporteur, CNN Pat Etheridge, is a journalist specialising in the health of children and family problems.
Should her mother be terrified when her daughter starts growing breasts and fluffy in shame in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, he explained to the paediatric endocriminologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents don’t usually sign of rapid development towards a full teenager,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, shame absorbing and in armpit and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
However, over the last 40 years, there has been only a small shift at the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When it begins to develop breasts, at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early teenager in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (Cast pub in girls: A necessary guide to mastering this common problem)
The most reliable test of how the teenager continues is time.
It discusses what activates the real beginning of teens, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 years of age, the girl is considered to be "pre-developed".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by children’s doctors.
Faster growth can be a reason for the endocrime to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to medication deployment, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “the suppression of the teenager can alleviate the behavior of a girl and her feelings that are different from its peers.”
It is understandable to see another big problem: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry that he may become pregnant or how he will handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstrual in 10 years.
Although there were signs, and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and angry at her friends first.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent set of evidence that hormones are found in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – get teenagers earlier.
The caplopitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason for this is an outbreak of obesity.
In 2001, he helped with a study in girls aged between 6 and 9 years, which combines body fat with the timing of teens.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach teenages before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early teen patterns seem to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already at low age, they appear on their faces and shames, the trend towards a full bloom of early teens is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference added further complexity to this topic.
Accompaniment and absorption are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful as to how we identify the actual arrival of the teenager," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrime from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their child doctor on how to speak to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation with a child before you assume it,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
The girls that develop earlier need assurances that even when this is happening prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of farming.
Does he have a new job?
Naďa Konvalinková's actress (62) appeared behind a hound in the role of the pub, and she was very successful.
That the popular Czech actress was planning a change of profession and went to business in a pub?
Náďa Konvalinková appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even the chief offered to hire me, and I could feed on rolling beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I do today at acting," she said with the smile of Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the operation of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey here," she said.
Also a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový showed up at the event.
I'm dead, and I can't breathe in the current new life.
I am allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to follow it," he added.
Aircraft manufacturers are interested in the width of seats, big contracts are at stake
The leading aircraft manufacturers have burnt down a dispute about the width of seats in the second class for long distance flights, which has led to a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The object of the dispute is the width of seats provided for the long-distance flights for the economic class – not the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose space allocated is the key to the claims of efficiency for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called this week for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the major American rival Boeing says that they are to decide the airline.
The dispute arises at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in selling their two-engine long-distance aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is disintegrated – especially if it is next to itself 9 or 10 seats – is the basis for economic performance claims for the proposals of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that the improved model “777X” will bring 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will reach 350 people at 46 cm wide economic seats spread out after 9.
Large aeroplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the Dubai Airbus show, where it is expected that 777X will gain an advantage with over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what might be the beginning of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture of three people sealed in a restaurant “Do you want to like it? ”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats much easier than they are in regional turbine aircraft," said Airbus John Leahy.
As food baits change, people are bigger, but seats on planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, according to the U.S. Health Ministry, the weight of an average American in the age of 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, an average American in the 21st century has a belt of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted a research that suggests that the seat extension by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing the size of the seat of Airbus refuses and states that it is not within the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines exports the fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more things than just the width of the seat.
"This is really about providing air companies with flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe to be successful," said Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, there is a major greater space for lodges, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Under this dispute, an aircraft race with an estimated trade in the next decade, worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, is enough to elevate the scales of America's and European exports.
As Reuters stated in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to reach 20 percent better efficiency in their latest proposals than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend partly on comparing the 777X model design with 10 seats in a row and design of 777 s 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10th largest concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to fuel more seats and make his aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Head of Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with that many passengers are for a denser distribution which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Fourty-five centimetres of a wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of a 777 model," said the expert at the interior of Mary Kirby's cabin, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose.
They even carry a measuring zone with them to check competitive arrangements.
While they are driven by comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater adjustment of the cabin by offering larger seats for some of its aircraft in the streets.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the sales waves of 777X.
The number of HIV infecteds crossed the 1000th in Prague
The number of infected animals is increasing annually in the Czech Republic.
For example, in 2002 the tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later, there were 121 already, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, it was infected 212, and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases is over 200, which I think is no longer in doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavátý, who led the Prague Light House to patients for years.
According to him last January to September, 165 HIV patients came in the country, this year 176 of them.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, most infected in Prague.
Their figure in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected persons in the Mediterranean region.
The diagnosis also heard 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezsky or 116 from Ústeckie.
The least infected was from Vysočina, 19 of them.
In total, 88 percent of patients had sex infection.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
Such a case, however, has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of the century.
Six children were also born with HIV, moved from mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity are, but the wonder is beautiful, says the experts
A fantastic movie from Gravity Space was sold out in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
In October, almost 150 000 viewers saw him by the Union of film distributors and made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews the picture positive.
However, there are certain irregularities in it.
The server Lidovka.cz asked experts from a range of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Starbaser and Planetary Brno): I like science-fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
The Gravitation film does not express itself, even if it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It doesn't, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I've had too much of it.
You might notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which is not carried out in a state of troublelessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving across markedly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some film audiences are reading an unreal effect and even the whole behavior of fire in a state of trouble.
They don't think the suit could stand up to such wounds either.
The heroes in the movie Gravity often get into collisions with different objects and suits without any greater difficulty will last everything.
The critics were not spared, neither was the plot.
Such an extensive tragedy on the orbital course of the earth is unreal according to some of the discussion.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People argue about the "nerve" behavior of the ropes on the forums.
He says it acts as if it was intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (the director of the Starárny and planetarium of Prague): I have seen him only on a wide screen, but I can clearly say, I have been charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't documentary, but science fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to follow consistently reality.
"More than you mentioned irregularities, I was touched by how three times space stations with a degraded level of technology (after Chinese) are shown."
"The Chinese will probably look better at the end of the decade than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (the director of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes the authors are very successfully trying not to violate physical laws, and so the naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite right, spoken by the dictionary physicist, the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including thin skins of the atmosphere and polar glow near the polar areas.
I'm sure they'll find unbalancing in a more detailed investigation.
In addition, for example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic garbage on orbits in some scenes appears reversed than it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (the employee of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but no essential and to the sky calling for a sin against logic or natural laws I did not notice in film and, compared to other films similar to the focus, it is visible that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the presented events.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth calling out the fact that Hubble's space telescope is running on a different slope than the IFRSs.
As a result, there is a significant difference in the speed and rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalski department (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock) I did not notice that the whole ISS would be rotating, so there is no clear origin for the forces operating on Kowalski, which force both actors to move at the moment when they are no longer moving against each other.
A new nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing people, we need to carry out further tests that will take place for several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the University of Health, Well Cornell, New York, says that the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available today, but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches can be overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains harmless virus that has been compiled to provide genetic information for the creation of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which will begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all nicotinic molecules in the bloodstream and neutralise them before they get to the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests of vaccinate mice that were added to nicotine continued in their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated said "sorry," said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
Experiences are described in Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered so often to maintain sufficient antibody levels, so that they appeared expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into antibodies production plants.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could give themselves up to children before they wanted to try the cigarette, and they would avoid addiction to nicotine.
Much more likely, though, smokers would use it to stop.
“They will know that if they start to smoke again, because of nicotine vaccine they will have no benefit from it, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists have said that the results have been interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripods deny that he would affect Obeid
Former Labour Minister of the New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on Corruption.
Former Minister of the New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal rent at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeida, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government of controlled land.
On Friday, an independent committee against corruption (ICAC) expanded its search to see if Mr. Obeid was lobbying with several state ministers to hire him at the Circle Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and cafes, restored without having to attend a selection procedure after his expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeida's secret interests in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by the former Deputy Deputy Director of Mr Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government insisted on moving to public competition.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases were renewed for companies in Circle Quay, which were awarded to Obeids $2.5 million a year, without the need to participate in the public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a favourer of public competition.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeida, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on shifting the government's rent policy.
The transcription of calls submitted at ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, the head official who came to the port department after he worked under Mr. Obeid in the fishing department.
"Was he been the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi.
"No," said Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible factor
Israeli military aircraft hit the target at the Syrian port of Lazikí on Thursday night, confirming the responsible administration officer Fox News Station.
This responsible person specifically did not say what the target was, but said he was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press states that the goal was SA-125 Russian production missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel launched an air attack on supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator Pečínka spoke so that it could be agreed, while the president of Štěch had breathed out of the factory.
Heytman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The chairman of Saturday has always been, and is the symbol of the folly of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen have shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a basic and readable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made the most impossible conversation on TV.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than the CzechSSD proposed as Prime Minister of the Senate of Gajdůšková, the only one should not have an initial hendikep and I think would do the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone from the management will hardly support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could set up a minority government with only blessing from the President of Babis and without the people, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This minimensian government would have great stability because it would promote a proper referendum law, and such a commitment was to support the President of the Dawn Okamura too.
In the end, Prime Minister Babish would accept the progression of taxes, for he is bright and he will see that it is not possible without her.
People wouldn't bring trouble because Talk is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same is true of the ANO, and here a valuable minister would be found, but if reasonablely they do not want to enter a risky government participation, but they will provide support, too.
Let's get some courage on Alena Gajdů!
Foreign visa workers may submit a ‘legality’ test.
As the government intends to expand police operations, it considers the ‘legality’ test for foreign visa workers 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied to the middle management of the criteria to prevent the 457 programme being used to fill out unskilled positions, or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labourist Member Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric of foreign workers in saying that it could offend Australian neighbors.
“A loud statement by “foreigners” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the union demanded a protected labour market” said today for Australian-Indian institute.
Historically, this meant that white labour should be protected – and I wouldn’t wonder if anyone in this region had recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain considered.
Where the eligibility criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsor undertaking’.
After previous experience with companies who intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also need to justify the number of visa holders 457.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died suspected of a heart attack after arriving on a asylum ship this week on Christmas islands.
A man’s nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia with him and, after his father’s death, comforted him an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities rushed to a hospital in the Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that the high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England start as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project is "joined together by the Great Britain".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was working with the British Government on this plan "extended".
The first phase will consist of a new high speed train line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is finished, the line from Manchester will lead to Leeds.
In June, the government reviewed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which conducted interviews with the National Transport Offices Transport Scotland, has entrusted HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Barone Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better connect the United Kingdom and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also a link – 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “The announcement today is a good news for Scotland.”
Mr Carmichael called on the Scottish Government to support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland an immeasurable economic advantage, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.”
We are very excited to cooperate with the British Government to explore the possibilities to bring high-speed rail to Scotland and thus bring all the benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is planning.
I look forward to the review of the report on this study, together with the UK ministers next year and the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bartou, inspection and analysis of anti-corruption police have been arrested.
Information about the arrest of Vita Barta started spreading on Thursday night when the report brought to the server Firstrights.cz.
MF DNES found that the case took place in charge of the General Security Council (GIBS), her people had to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It happened in front of Four Seasons.
However, the inspection solves cases where there are cases between the defendants, but its competence also applies to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, one officer of anti-corruption police is the head of analysts and computer science Jan Petržílek.
He worked for Security Information Service in the past.
The anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, but refused to comment with the industry that the media had to turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesperson to Radka Sandor, but she didn't want to say anything about the case, she referred her turnover to the City State Prosecutor's office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be derived from this non-concretionary reaction that the event has taken place, but it is under cover that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
There is also Bart's lawyer Oldrich Chudoba in a similar situation.
He told the media that Bartu was representing "and in this matter", but given the fact that it was classified information, he could not confirm Barart's arrest nor reverse it.
Some media were first speculating that Bart's arrest might be related to local police President Petr Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart, together with former chairman of the VV Radek John, who was sitting at the head of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute, which over time had to deal with the then president Václav Klaus, between the exremier Peter Nečas and the VV.
I don't know where this link to my person came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I don't know anything about the matter," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
He was officially appointed by Radek John, the real boss of the party, but Bárt was then.
Bárta has now run for election for the Dawn movement, the parliamentary mandate has escaped just close - 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura declared that he had no idea what was going on.
"Bárt was one of many candidates for many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of the Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the elections said he had given Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of exekutors.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former associate from VV Jaroslav Škarko.
Rules on the use of electronic aircraft equipment will remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Travellers of Australian airlines will have to shut down their tablets and smart phones during starting and landing even regardless of changes in the US to ease the rules on these devices.
American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has put space in American companies to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their facilities, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the facilities remain in the “aircraft” regime.
Passengers can already do this during a major part of the flight, but many people bother not to have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
The Australian carriers examine this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but indicate that they do not plan to change their procedures in a short time.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulation governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft," he said.
This question is covered by the rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from crew members.
Virginia, who has already talked to the CASA about extending the use of her online entertainment system wi-fi, has been inclined to change, but has announced that they will be subject to the decision of the regulatory authority.
“We would welcome this if the CASA conducted an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic equipment, because we really think that it would now have improved customer experience when we (wireless fun),” the speaker said.
Qantas has announced that the current regulations will continue to apply for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
The FAA provisions apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in the development of a regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we are certainly studying carefully the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training material, manual baggage programs and information for passengers.
"As soon as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, passengers may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude," FAA said.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew shall be ordered by passengers to switch off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that the harder equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during the take-off and take-off.
With the growing poverty of middle class, pawnshops in Singapore develop
At Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings stopped to pay her daughter to pay her school.
“My husband and I just bought a house and gave it all my money,” says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although each month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the monthly family income is inadequate, says.
The demand across areas in southeastern Asia – where household debt increases – indeed, it is that ValueMax, where a woman does his transaction, has become the third stop on the market in Singapore this week.
The stopping of jewelry is not just a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthaling – but is also almost as cheap as unsecure bank loans.
The bus stops in Singapore normally use an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just over 15.4 percent of the rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, stops have the advantage that they do not require verification of the person(s) or income document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
That is why families feel pressure because of increasing living costs and increasing household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops.
After five years of strong growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a released monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income are turning to pawnshops to deal with a worsening financial situation.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of household credit mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have taken into account the gross domestic product by households in Asia.
Malaysia is facing a ladder with an 80 percent ratio of GDP, which is an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
The Ekonoms were also concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which only got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weak export and weakening consumer demand.
"The important thing is that people from middle to low [receivers] will try to complete their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, economist in the Malaysian CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people dweltly stop their personal property and use the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban pawnshops form gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get him back next month.
In Thailand, EasyMoney recorded an increase of up to 20% in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawn shop is so big that ValueMax, branch operator in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where he has four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yeah Lee Chingová.
The company will fund it using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD that it won this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors have been criticized by high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the delay offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Consignors stop objects that they already own, and the possession of personal property does not increase household debt”, he says.
In the company, assets are increasingly accepted as a means of providing short-term, secure funding.
Moreover, among those using pawnshops, they are not only people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branch when they stop gold rods or Rolex watch, and they can get up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are of all possible ratios.
“They include rich individuals who need to borrow short-term for their courageous transactions or investments, or small businesses that need help to solve problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Petite Health
The Federal Government insists that the rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmania’s combined health care contained harsh conditions to ensure that the government does not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliberse announced that the Republic of Australia is a “rich measure” to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Estonian Member Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which, as we believe, will solve the specific problems that the state faces,” Mrs. Pliberse said today.
The $25 million package contains 31 million dollars for surgery at the request of the patient.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey-crack operations, will help to eliminate debt.
The money is also available to freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and introducing personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the thoughts that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the statistical system," said Mrs. Pliberse.
In particular, it was pointed out by the Minister that the Flemish Government had to require a strict reporting regime and anonymity obligation.
The State will have to maintain its current level of funding to receive the funds of the Australian Union, and to report monthly on where additional funds have been incurred.
A three-member committee shall be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless, “although real reform will not follow for a more sustainable basis of the human health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government in response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first raised in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can erode public health from critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional procedures selected will significantly reverse recent cuts.
The spokesperson of the Federal Health Opposition Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a “capture”.
“The reason why I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that costs $300 million, and it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton invited Mrs. Pliberse to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
The Guillaume Nicolux adapted the amendment to Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and a drawing of time, but it is also more boring than it should be.
They meet in the 1960s of the 18th century in France and tell a dark story about Suzanne, a young noble who is sent to his family to the monastery.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother, and for others he becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to lust or sleepiness, and that's his problem.
The ceremonyal nature of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience torture similar to the wearing of thirsty shirts.

Syria destroyed its resources for the manufacture of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, said on Thursday the Committee on Global Control of Chemical Weapons, while the violent conflicts in the north of the country broke out, near one of the places where toxic substances are stored.
On Thursday, also the Syrian activist group declared that more than 120 000 inhabitants had been killed since the beginning of civil war almost three years ago.
Notice The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the date that this organisation, based in the Hague, has established Damascus to destroy or prevent the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion of this in principle initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including the yperite and nerve gas of the sarin.
The announcement came at a time when, on Thursday, fighting in the city of Safira, which experts are talking about as a plant seat in the manufacture of chemical weapons and storage facilities, the Syrian human rights observer, based in Britain.
A group of activists, which, through a network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
This is supposed to be 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of Bashar Asad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 soldiers from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
There are also 2,202 government runners among the killed, and about 5, 375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organisation estimated that 100 000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Asa's troops have fought against rebels in Safira, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
It was observed on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The battles have undermined the danger faced by inspectors for chemical weapons, who in their mission, when they are in the midst of the continuing civil war of Syria to rid the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight terms.
The OPCW statement, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, said that his team is now “comforted to verify – and to monitor the destruction – of Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that "no other control activities are currently being planned".
Previously this week, the inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 out of 23 seats declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places for security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites were “released and ... items of the chemical weapon programme which contained were moved to two other declared sites which were checked”.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed with the plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I worship the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission, which this organisation has ever had," said the director of observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his comments by the OPCW authority.
Now, in his third year, he stands up against himself in civil war mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and Asad's government with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alavith sects, resembling Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the Head of the Observed Rami Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion in the middle inside of the anti-air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikí.
He said the cause of the explosion wasn't known.
Anger over a judgment launched by an assailant of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bombing attack on Bali in 2002 have made a very angry response to the judgment raised over the last of the Soviets who were brought before justice and said that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted in southeastern Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building an explosive device that was used in a bombing.
He could be released in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder on two night clubs in the popular Kuta tourist area, after which there were 202 people dead, including 88 Australans, and many injured.
He was also found guilty at several other points of prosecution related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas evening 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, although it may insist that a man with the nickname “Demolation man” (damaged) should receive death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision reinvigorated the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Pertha, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a destructive attack launched by Patek and other Soviets almost ten years ago.
With tears in the eyes, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built before the execution reading.”
Every day, I have to live with not seeing another grandkids and my daughter.
The Sari club was compared to the country when it was on October 12, 2002 shortly after the 23rd hour a strong load was fired in the outdoors parked van.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber set off a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three doctors “depleted. ”
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jaja Islamia responsible for massacre – Amrosi, Muchlas and Imama Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death penalty like nobody.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, he's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of other people, it's not that bad.
Patek was in court as the last of the Bali bombers.
The arrest was avoided for almost 10 years, but in January 2011, he was attacked in the town of Abbottabad, where less than four months later American forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden.
During the court, the FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect with terrorist groups from southeastern Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he didn't feel regret for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and to which will be the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we'll see a lot of tears," said Mrs. Corteen.
The paternal may appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological extracts on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – except for calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of impatiently expected new rules, which on Thursday published Federal Air Management (FAA).
Passengers, however, do not expect any changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change will be introduced, according to individual airlines, the FAA Michael Huerta told the administrator at the press conference.
Air companies will have to add to the FAA administration, to the extent that their aeroplanes comply with new rules and that they have updated the training manual for the boarding crew and the storage of equipment to comply with the new rules.
FAA stated that since some airlines received plans to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"As far as the status of such a plan is concerned, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly," said FAA in its statement.
Currently passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches 3 kilometres, and the captain doesn't issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to switch off their facilities again when the plane is falling to land, and they will not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft is correctly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their facilities during their take-off, landing and ride, FAA stated.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft, adapted to allow passengers to use the VIS at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stevards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with the transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said.
Well, we're actually tired of us looking like a "watchman."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometres of altitude, said the agency.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into the air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by Actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was well known, fired from an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And a harder device like laptops will have to be stored for fear of hurting someone if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules on the use of mobile phones do not mean FAA, but the US federal telecommunications committee.
The FAA may terminate the prohibition on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Security Committee on Transport, a national safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“Motive phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference with the sending towers," Rosenker said.
In order to examine this problem, the FAA’s Committee of Industry proposed that the government allow a wider use of electronic equipment last month.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to reduce the restrictions on their use.
Critic, such as Senator Claire McCaskell, a Democrat from Missouri, claims that there is no valid security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also more difficult to promote because the use of such devices is entirely present.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference in navigation and communication equipment, when the passengers started carrying FM radios, technical supplies of the time thereafter.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering Wi-Fi use for several years in travel altitudes.
The plans adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The large majority of airlines should adapt to the greater use of electronic equipment under the new rules, said Huert.
Current electronic equipment generally emit much less intensive radio transmissions than it was for installations of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers shall issue only a minimum transmission on the page-return.
But broadcasting is stronger when the devices download or transmit data.
Among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic readers Kindle and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Passengers Society said that it is convinced that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that only marketable reports are available from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to enable passengers to disable devices during flying by means of low visibility devices.
The Group of the tourism industry welcomed these changes and, according to them, it is a reasonable procedure for the public that uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Tourist Association.
The bird was taken by air from the drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was delivered to the coast after he was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into free nature.
One chicken was transported to Aberdeen last month after the Scottish company of SPCA had treated him earlier in the rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon’s operating center said: “This was probably migratory from northern Europe when a strong wind caught it over the North Sea.”
Apparently, he ran out of strength, and he found refuge on the oil platform.
Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help.”
At the time he was released, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready for the Britannia Store?
The campaign for Business for Britain (trade for Britain) was launched in April with a promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in relation to the EU want to see British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have provided the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing British enterprises of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of enterprises are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favors new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than breaking into a long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the cost of Brussels regulation now outweighs the advantages of being part of the European trade area – even 40 percent of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that the clear majority wants Britain to seek a change of contract and a relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
From the finding with which businesses of different sizes and main business groups have been identified, it shows that the business sector is pushing the "sensual change" that will transfer the effect back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a change of contract and a better agreement for Britain could result in up to 16% in voting in a referendum for the maintenance of the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that the British trade supports its plan to modernise the conditions of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and given how the euro area travels for a closer economic and fiscal union, even more and more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the results of our survey show, business must be to refocus on trade and a major change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: The spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes been spying on "too far", admitted according to the AFP agency the head of American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, he served to reverse terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, the first confession was made in the middle of a violent field on both banks of the Atlantic due to the scandalous discovery of mass monitoring by the US National Security Agency (NSA) data, the target of which became American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just like the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he was primarily defending his past practice.
According to him, information collection is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the USA, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings explode and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time about the plot," Kerry emphasized.
However, once again, he admitted that the collection of information "in some cases came extremely far".
The affair around American intelligence, which reportedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke through this month in Europe.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans also followed Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Europe’s leaders have not concealed disillusionment, and some of them have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to restrict or significantly reduce the monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says that a pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
Opening of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing a mercenary: It started construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the whole European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian export through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are always eliminated.
Once the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a reduced price.
Gazprom says that construction is expected to begin in other countries in the course of the year.
Gas pipeline is designed for annual capacity of 2.2 trillion crystal gas alloys.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
There's a decisive battle waiting.
Hisbollah's Lebanon movement spread 15 000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle of the mountainous area of Kalamun.
According to Israel’s constantly escalating reports at midday raids at two locations in Western Syria, he destroyed the rockets intended by Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the movement of arms to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
The reports of Middle Israeli raids on West Syria weapons warehouses are yet to be clarified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but the U.S. sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region have hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakí.
Al-Arabija reports that two warehouses were hit, in which missiles were prepared to transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was a rocket from Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria was constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and Syrian air force teaches members of the Hezbollah armed section to deal with missiles.
SA-8 has been an outdated missile with Syrian army since the '80s.
They're placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to mobility and small dimensions.
They're equipped with radar, but after firing the missile, it's hard to target them.
Latakíj is located in western Syria, in the area surrounded by ruling alávits.
It's a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fear of Western Syria in the past.
They claim to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, whose alávités belong to.
Now, reportedly, 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah there, the Syrian army is strengthening its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is to be remunerated according to the source of al-Arabia for the recent attack of opposition to the headquarters of Syrian Shii brigade abú Fadla Abbás in Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajra have just gone to Kalamun.
Just recently, most citizens in the Czech Republic seemed to want premature elections.
As reasons, corruption was reported, spending money on overpriced purchases and state contracts, increasing taxes and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that most citizens have complied with this situation.
That they didn't actually mind and the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters failed to vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all right voters.
Which is the superhuman majority.
When I added 1 016 829 voters to the above parties to ČSSD, then with the old order (because all of those parties were involved in the "circumvention" and debt of the State), 64.23% of the right-wing voters actually agreed with that state.
In fact, the majority of voters made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty peoples of stealing and prejudging this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who were involved in this are entitled laws?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) were charged before the action against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Children's Sexual Abuse found that two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse by children before they were charged with child abuse.
But before the commission, it was said that in their initial statement to the commission, this association indicated that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of the child in their organisation.
The Executive Director, Phillip Hare, was asked when one of the employees of the YMCA association was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and another, when the gymist at Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted for sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the board counselor, he knew about the first case, but not the second case.
He admitted that the initial declaration of the YMCA association was also vague when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organisation, which evaluated this organisation as the primary supporter of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the commission is that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations at the audit of the Ministry of Education and the company of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began to work with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that leading from him had failed to accept the Lord without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to notify their children's safety rules.
Previously this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment by 12 boys, whom he committed within two years of his work in the YMCA association.
He's been imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr Hare rejected the claim that YMCA had had a cultural problem that the staff had prevented a breach of the security of the Lord's children.
Staff members have provided evidence that they have witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately guarding them, letting them sit in his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was subordinate to Lord and asked for training for the safety of children, because she was worried about his behavior, testifies that Jacqui Barnat, head of service to children in the YMCA association in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was “very intimidating and has often been difficult to talk to him about something”.
The Director General said he didn't accept the evidence of staff that they felt unfaithful if they should contact their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had blacked out their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said that the YMCA Association Council in New South Wales said that the lesson learned from the “ Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “was not given any message” and that it agreed with it.
Mr Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreement shortly after the accusation occurred, he made the general manager for the services to the children in the organisation of YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the objective was to avoid any breach of evidence, but was "survivorally zealous" and misrepresented.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University said that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, processing, training and staffing.
The hearing was renewed on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return to the position of the Prime Minister, but he admitted that returning was unlikely.
In a night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the 59-year policy office, he expressed his views on the different areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leading position, Mr Blair mostly avoided talks about British politics and his comments on foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador of the Bízkeod Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the position of the Prime Minister, his answer to London’s Evening Standard newspaper was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to find that, so..."
While a bunch of experts gathered in Cardiff to show horses to fight for the prize of the Cane of the Year, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirklinda's three-year-old.
Although they don't go to school yet, and only a few months ago, he made the first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, they smoothly spelled out three laps to finally get the prize and left 30 addicts behind.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for the appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by Sunnybank in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in his elegant hats, stumbled his baret into a happy angle, and left his two-year-old Toffee promenade around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control horses, which far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest sign of insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee work well together.”
They didn't have much hope, but they eventually left with a gold cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and totally strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howwells, who shows horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone encouraged and danced. ”
He ran around the sand all over the arena and although he worked so small, he gave great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – loves horses, tractors and farm and got two chickens in charge.
As he starts, he'll be back to the Horse of the Year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
“ The Frenchmen are only three, but they already know how to control the pony.”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed at the competition.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and whoever leads it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the role.
I'm sure it helped Fenton to wear cute clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many wild newspapers to be investigated
Chinese newspapers, which on the front page requested the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a society partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now run "full repair".
The regulation for the "pravement" came from the State Administration for Print and Publications, radio, film and television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that, between September 2012 and August 2013, the newspaper New Express from the yang Group Evening News issued several false reports on the company Zoomlion.
"New Express editorial management was inconvenient," said the administrator in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose Chen Yongzhou administrative punishment in the form of a cancellation of the press licence".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Group has ordered Evening News to perform a full New Express repair, and it has recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately alter the management of the New Express list.”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles relating to financial irregularities in society with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, his newspaper published two applications for his release on its cover and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen showed up on State TV and confessed to the fact that he gave false stories for bribery.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said at the DCTV State Intelligence Station.
I've done it mainly because I've been looking for money and glory.
I realize I acted badly.
After an apology, Mr. Chen released a letter from New Express on the front page of the apology, in which he said that he failed when he failed to control his messages sufficiently.
Recently, several carefully monitored suspects have made a confession on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of the law this year, which forbids the authorities to force anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railways
She managed to discover one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The American authorities described a tunnel about one meter of dimensions as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors that ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of almost six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is full of undetermined warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before road roads are applied.
The authorities said that the tunnel was closed before drugs could be undetected in it.
The authorities also, together with the discovery of the tunnel, arrested eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with the aim of distribution.
In the event of a conviction, he is facing sentences of imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers enter extensive drain channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of the drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to the consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres long equipped with railways, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre connect management.
They will, for example, offer joint advertisers
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague Karlín.
Economics has made another step towards transforming the holding center into its media home.
Since Friday, Economics and the Centre have a common top management.
The "unification of organizational structures and personnel union are essential for integrating both publishers into a joint media house," comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Board of Economics and the Deputy Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The sword, which will be the head of the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Holdings Andreas Demuth Centre.
The new Joint Director of Trade was appointed by Pavel Vopař, who is also subordinate to the advertising director of the two Zuzana Tylčová companies.
Štěpán Burda became the new chief of information technology.
The joint editor is Vladimír Piskaček, whose team is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was assigned to the newly established marketing director's office.
Viera Lhotská is now managing the corporate communication.
The joint financial manager is Karel Žadul, the management of human resources for both publishers leads Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure allows us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the creation of all titles issued and, last but not least, to significantly improve the company's business management," he added.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded the purchase contract of the Center Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Center Holdings consists of servers News.cz, Female.cz, web portals, extensive email base under the brands of Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Nastano or portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is a publisher of Hospodářské noviny, IHNED.cz news server, Respekt and Ekonom weeklys and many of the B2B titles printed as well.
The Czech publishers have long been the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to a newly built modern space in Prague Karlín.
CME focuses on television business.
They'll release nearly a quarter of people.
The CME's media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to take a thousand people down.
He's going to cut off all the side effects and only wants to focus on his main business, his television.
The group which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia also employs some 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will lose their job.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds the license for television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV music station.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs some 650 people, and what it will mean for TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
"It is premature and we really cannot comment on it," said the director of the communication of Nowy Josef Koukolkíček.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies of the Czech Republic are not going to go any further, but this should have the greatest impact on the personnel states of CME in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who began after Adrian Sarbu's long-term director, spoke during the Middle Conference with Analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to TV business.
It is therefore likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
At the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, the cooling tower burned down at night.
In the Czech industrial complex in Prague, a large-scale storage tank was burned, according to the fire department, apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire was driven by the fire by fire by fire by the fire already on Thursday night 11 o'clock, and this morning, the spokesperson of the Prague firemen Pavlín Adamcová announced.
The amount of damage in the air area according to measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are unknown so far.
Some five dozen firemen gradually arrived in Kolben Street.
"One of the fires of a large-scale storage tank, probably a cooling tower," said Adamc.
"In the complex there is no functional hydrant network, so we extinguish using the traffic lines from the tanks," she said.
According to the server tn.cz, the firemen had to repair the water from elsewhere.
Fireman reported second-degree fire alarm.
There are quite four, in the most serious situations the fourth one is declared.
Chemicals also went to the scene to verify the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of damage that would exceed the hygiene standards," said the firemen.
The British police delivered Assange a notice of release
Today, the British police delivered a notification to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuador embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that a 40-year-old Australian delivered a “notice of issue” saying he was asked to come to the police station and that if he didn't do so, he could threaten his arrest.
Assange, under the British Act, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court canceled this month's appeal against the issue, thus facing the Swedish release for accusations of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm had released him to the United States, he sought asylum on 19 June at the Ecuador embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard “a report on the issue of a 40-year-old man who asks to come to the police station on the day and hour that he was appointed ” said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy refused to deliver a notice of publication to comment.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face the charges of espionage, because on the WikiLeaks website he published 250,000 American diplomatic papers.
The driver received a fine £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist received a fine of £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his feet.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was seen on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.

In the Colchester Howi police court, he confessed to charges that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
There were seven points on his account, resulting in a six-month ban on the proceedings.
Howie has also been ordered to pay the cost of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of taxes on owners of foreign properties, the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has pre-numbered the tax on the return of financial assets, but waits for Mr Osborn's final decision, which, in the budget of 2012, introduced a fee of 7 % for the transfer of real estate to buildings in excess of GBP 2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
Revenue from the payment for the transfer of real estate in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Sevezpad and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “With regard to the increase in the transfer of real estate to homes of high value and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high value is little taxed regardless of the effect of an outdated system of head taxation.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to buy real estate in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell.”
Front real estate – up to 5 % to 10 % of the residential market by price – in a rich band, which ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase in record 11,8 % over the last year.
The prices in central London continued to show year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but they were mutilated by the emerging "home market" on which South West, north (7.4%) and east (65%) of the increase in real estate agency Savills, according to the survey.
Scientists have explained more how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs drill the tail more transport (from the eyes of the dog) while nervous dogs tend to wave the tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs will prove these fine differences in the motion of the tail to record and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “In people it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different links to suggestions that stimulate positive or negative emotions.”
We've tried to spot the same thing with other species.
He added that as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-wing movements and vice versa and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In order to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate drilling of the tail of other dogs, researchers were monitoring animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on one side and another.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dog videos about dogs – whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to rid ourselves of any confusing impulses, and we have also managed to modify the movement of the tail and to depict it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw a different insignificant dog moving their tails to the right (from the sight of a dog drilling tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she recorded recording the tail mostly left (familiar from the sight of a dog drilling tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs would communicate with each other knowingly through these movements.
Rather, they think that dogs from experience have learned which movements they must not look out for.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly connected with rather friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help the owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers to understand better the emotions of their animals.
An expert on the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, a university teacher of dissertation at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs was important.
Last year, the Lincoln University team found out that dogs are turning their heads back on the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “With a dog’s robot, dogs were more likely to meet when he was turning his tail to the left than to the right, when they were more uncertain – on the contrary, compared to the Italian study.”
The difference may be given by dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dog robots not quite like dogs.
He explained that she could help studies about how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different mammals, there are compelling evidence that both sides of the brain are used for various purposes, many details are still to be clarified – and dogs are not the exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alex Turner's illness moved the concert in Glasgow

Pope Frantisek named the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Franz 22 February was the first name of the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church in the clergy right after the Pope, and they are those who choose the Pope, so František will set up his first group of men who will eventually help select his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, which can no longer participate in the election of the Pope, the group is thus reduced to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement notifying this report, Mr Federico Lombardi, spokesperson of the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, the assembly of current cardinals known as the Conservatory will take place.
"The Pope Frantisek has decided to communicate his decision to call the February Conservatory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the list Catholic Voices said the number of callers is likely to fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Conservatory next year will be significant, because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At this point, there is a certain focus on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a slight number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to whom he gave the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was possible that the Pope’s cardinals would request counsel.
But in this situation we were not before – it's completely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally raised bishops from great places as cardinals, but František is “full of surprise – so we don't know who he is. ”
GM downloads some new light freight cars in the USA due to repair of seat backrests
According to Friday's announcement from the American Authority for Car Safety General Motors, General Motors downloads nearly 19 000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to repair the fault with manual loading of the backrest.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism of loading front seats may have a failure mechanism.
As a result, seatbacks are not consistent with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice placed on the State Transport Security Site to the Road (NHTSA) says that “if a vehicle from the back gets hit, the head supporter does not need to protect the passenger correctly, thereby increasing the risk of injury”.
Downloaded models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM introduced the supply to the market in June and the most important introduction of the vehicle to the market since the restructuring of the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the fault supply in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to the 16-day government failure, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were converted for models in 2014, increased in the first 10 months of this year to about 20 percent, declared GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,60 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its supply.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon at 37.47 USD.

On this book, I thought that during the cloudy days of my second year at the Medical School, I would be encouraged and restored by a piece of hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patient reviews and go to bed tonight, the book returns me until politics inspired millions of people and manifestations took your breath.

It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In years after I threw my first electoral ticket, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Act on Available Care through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to say anything, not to say anything” after the death of Usama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that party obstructions have returned so much to move our nation forward: among others it is immigration reform, the possibility of public choice of health care and closure of the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations in front of colleagues and friends against Obama's administration, I am, as far as explanations that they can provide are concerned, reached an absolute limit.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Sister-in-law of the Republicans cannot explain the consent of listening to foreign leaders or to raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children in overseas.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, even that it pursues those who detect misnegotiations of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without proper court, or for restricting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the White House’s efforts to silence media are “the most aggressive... from the Nixon administration.”
And they can't even apologize inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the Act on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether I was 18 years old I should have known that government power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded her.
Apparently, it has no predictable course of conduct, and our public talks will form an opposition political party and sudden events like a massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have set out above seem largely to be the result of my own decision of administration.
And that bothers me most.
I voted for both of them again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his scandal.
Mitt Romney represented a palpable and unscrupulous alternative and seemed to be unable to strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would be filled with the hopes we once heard of.
However, the 2008 return – with Obama's support falling below 45% this week – more and more through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter on Obama's recent primacy in Pennsylvania, suffered a sharp defeat with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to his pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Tony Abbott's Prime Minister is in conflict of interest due to a parental leave program
The Billionary and Member of Clive Palmer say that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest due to the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from this.
The bane magnate, which leads to a dispute over the payment of the carbon tax measure of $6 million, made this statement when he tried to contact the table with the question of whether it was in conflict of interest.
Palmer’s United Party may control up to four votes in the Chamber, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether coal tax and mining are to be collected.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit from a given personal policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest in paying his parental leave, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting a parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election of the election committee, after the recount of the votes, Mr Palmer officially declared the winner in the fight for the chair behind the Fairfax District in Sunshine Coast, thanks to the profit of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the electoral results to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the conclusion of the electoral rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, immediately vote and have the results at half-seven o'clock?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark voting cards.
The point is, the results can be eliminated if anyone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also refers to the Airport in Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found out that washing your hand is coming to you.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unsolvable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But a group that, after failure, washed its hands, was a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the "with their hands washed" group did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet those who washed their hands had achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of "motivative" were at the level of a third group whose participants did not record any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical purity removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the lower motivations, tested in other trials must be much more focused.
If we took the results of research in Bohemia, we would probably be most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but it is already a fifth on the way to the city transport.
In hygiene, it is often popular after work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The caressing of a pet moves to wash hands of 78.7 percent of people.
Recent research has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as far as it is necessary to wash hands after handing to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The research showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it was on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do something a little better," said Dr. Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange merchants
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by control authorities regarding suspected currency-market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with competent authorities in the investigations of the largest financial market in the world, where every day the owners change USD 5.3 trillion.
The mention of two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is referred to a scandal with the manipulation of the LIBOR rate (the London interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it received a request from the authorities for information this month.
"Our unscrupulous investigation continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other institutions," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS provided financial behaviour records of e-mails and fast messages sent from accounts and accounts of a former trader.
This merchant, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as President of the Foreign Trade Bank of JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European president of cash trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former foreign exchange manager at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher's group of quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, who told the people dedication to this event.
The Bank of UBS stated this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that he was investigating suspicious machines on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it took steps against some of its employees.
The European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the USA and the Ministry of Monetary Affairs in Hong Kong – examines the claims that these bankers have come together to move to the monetary market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information from the competent authorities.
The banks have been cleaning up years of fast news and e-mails to find cases of infractions.
The reports on investigations have paid traders in the area, which has been one of the largest engines for profit creation in the closures of investment banks in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that the low stability of the currency has reduced the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, it is basically impossible to manipulate, but highly merchants say that this does not necessarily be true.
A highly well-designed trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign foreign currency trading in liquidity exchange between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that this week she released from her department for trading shares of a trader who caused almost USD 6 million loss due to the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with their control authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIVs infected in Prague has exceeded 1000.
Doctors in Prague have already registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of surveillance in 1986 until the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in total 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,63 have been infected throughout the Czech Republic.
In 396 disease, immunity failure has already begun.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has grown annually in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later, there were 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010. 180.
Last year the number fell to 153, but last year it was record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases is over 200, which I think is no longer in doubt," thinks the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavátý, who led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavátý.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, HIV tests have been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has resulted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
Whoever wants to really know a town should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk by a citizen's center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would have declared a Bedecre.
Many people read the graves.
They slowly wander cemeteryes and get intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities such as faith, how large and coherent families belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status as tasteful.
And from the condition of the grave, they also find out how they take care of their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is consistent with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama administration.
The ratio of votes 5:4 has been that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which the citizens are ordering to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise it threatens to pay fine – does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
President John Roberts stood on the side of four liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remainder of the Law on 2700 pages and decided that the statutory requirement for health care, which orders the States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of the disposal of all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not law enforcement and contrary to the Constitution.
For the purpose of blocking this law 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have been lodged.
In 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitta Romney.
"Mugabe is a lame donkey" no longer threatens prison, the court has revoked the law
Up until now, the Zimbabwans had to pay good attention to how they were speaking in public about the 9th - year - old Mugab, who ruled the country since the early 1980s, since the end of 1987, has been at its head.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Act, 100 dollars up to one year of imprisonment has been threatened by the President's Office for derecognition.
"National representatives should not blame people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," said representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the Government will appeal to the court, and the British BBC has informed them.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans were voted against by the law, among them Tendai Danga, whom the police arrested the president two years ago in a fight with a police officer at the bar.
In May he ended up in prison with an opposition activist visiting Mugabe in public with an incisive donkey.
Then in August, the prosecutor accused a six-year-old man because of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court also declared that the anti-consisting law restricting media freedom.
"The standing cannot punish people whose statements will later appear untruthful," said Deputy Minister Luke Malal.
Until now, Zimbawian law allows a person who makes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law to criminalise someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express freely," Malala added.
No matter how hard the country has been ruling Mugabe for over 33 years, it has adopted a new constitution with wider civil freedoms in March Zimbabwe.
A small step towards one man's dictatorship began in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought to Morgan Tsvangira's prime minister.
However, the Earth continues to suffer from the economic crisis and up to 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely repealed the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other states apply.
The impoverished economy is going to Mugabe’s imperceptible agricultural reform.
In 2000 he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience running the parish.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks put this in their joint statement.
"This is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economist of the London Bank Barclays.
"In the meantime all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not my opinion that there is no surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, the main economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began to arise in 2007 when the international credit market first ran away.
The central banks' agreements have allowed access to the euro, the dollars and the other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its programme of support for the US economy, which could ban the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortfall of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the second currency is present.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another.
The ECB launches a third attempt to return confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, and the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) has personal data.
More than a year ago, I entered a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But then I didn't finish because on the side, someone just sat there who couldn't finish the internet registration.
And since I didn't want to drive to another branch, the registration fell, then I moved, and that's why I changed the address as well as the number of the civil ID.
When I wanted to register later, I was told that it was not possible because I had another OP number, address, and that it was just not possible to finish and that I should ask for erasure and execute a new registration.
So I did this, and I wrote on technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the law of the Data Protection Act.
That's what a big day she wrote me technical support that I have to register to finish on my side.
This started with a marathon of e-mails on technical support, where finally after 4th of August 25.10. they wrote that personal data at my request were erased.
So one would say that he could do this new registration and here the problems started again it was written to me that my username was already occupied (the machine was not deleted - it is not personal data, but they also disabled this).
So I used a different username and jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they be stored something that they claimed deleted?), so I contacted again technical support.
On my inquiry how it is possible to write that the personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
That's what I did (at night around 15 o'clock) and today I was told that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that's why it's not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the technical support I have been in contact with for a week now, and I'm dealing with them that they still can't.
What about the fact that if the truth were true (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, in those 13.22, I actually registered, for the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and the world of wonders, my website appeared to me that they sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how can it not be registered in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to the e-mail and phone number and the data did not just disable as they claim.
So I once again shared this technical support that they simply lie (be intentional and not know what they are writing) because what the song is not true.
I added several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. so "false" registration on this simply does not affect.
I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And communication is over.
Respective repeats the same sentence around that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that registration has not been completed by clicking on the link in the email and has not actually taken place.
So, if I sum up, Tipsport didn't just delete the information he claims to be, but he's still lying when he says otherwise.
What's worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things could go a little bit on the move and the technical support came e-mail that the matter was passed on to the investigation and I will be informed (after a week of urgenation and reasoning and alerting the same error).
In the subway on Bridge plays music
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in the subway.
The first vestibule, where during the operation of the subway constantly plays reproduced instrument music, is the Můstek line A at the exit of Wenceslas Square.
Testing will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new bialbum, band and three singers
The textist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his completely new two-CD Czech calendar, but above all in the program between us singers Lenka Novo, František Segrada and Ondr Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matìje Benka.
After intru and acting on a late musician Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers on stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story about the last time they played in Cologne and the theater and the electric current fell out of town.
"Jinak in Cologne produced two kinds of cards with which I came into contact," he recalled.
Also, he reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could tour after Zákolane or Dúbravka u Bratislava," he wrote about other presidents' brothers.
Several times a evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music.
The calendar also made by Josef Manes, who gave him on the clock, about ice hockey, but at that time he knew nothing about how we were meeting in the squares and we chanted who did not jump, there is no Czech.
It's also called one song from the Czech calendar, but we will not play here today," he entertained you.
Ondra Ruml, however, said that he would sing a good night's sleep for him and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he wasn't singing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied by a band in the composition of a keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three Vocalists together sang a little rusty into a heart eat, which immediately disintegrated the auditorium.
"I am glad that song caught you, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's city," then Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapku, she was reminded of the composition of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded by a huge aplaus, Hanu Heger, again remembered the composition of his father liked Lídu Baar as well as with the Horáčková explanation of the communist ban and replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composers, Michael Kocába, reminded the composition of Sebastián, then Segrado sang a beautiful piece of Prague, made by Jardou Svoboda, a sadist native and former Cologne.
That was the conclusion, however, of applause in standings and additions in the form of optimistic compositions We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more addition on the playlist, but they didn't cheer up the fans.
Almost immediately after the concert, he sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the packaging from legendary LP and with any interested parties.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will complement Rosol and Hájek
At the finale of Davis's Cup against Serbia, there was no winning captain of Czech tennis Jaroslav Navrátilářci Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech trophy representatives are defending, but they are going to play the field of rivals to the white garden arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15th to 17th November.
In the finale, the Czechs are three in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot land, it's gonna be wild, and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, uncle of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training Obama for how to bomb Syria.
U.S. commando in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have exactly demonstrated how Syria's bombardment is supposed to look.
Without unnecessary mushrooms, threats, and millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without allowing themselves to be derailed by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event, and they are no longer speaking to it.
The exact opposite of confused and generous, acts uncontested by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing on the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't let the media get confused by their claims that it was bombarded with a "syrian base" or "syrian supplies for Hezbalah".
I recently wrote here about the fact that while the United States aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical plane, Russia has welcomed Russia’s weapons from Syria.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian rockets built at the port of Latakija became the target of an Israeli raid.
Got a message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed Asad's regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theory, it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has created two sleeping units, probably Delta force.
It had not yet been known that they had taken place during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Bengáza.
She's known for the heroic death of two former SEALs, who were defending the CIA's premises in the city, I think, was members of a secret CIA squad that was formed by former soldiers.
For a long time, it was speculating what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in the CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, information that the CIA has its office in Libya, protected by machine-gun nests (the administration of one such member of the SEALs perished after intervention by the coin), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. Commander in Tripoli, and as soon as they got a report on the attack in Bengáza, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they set off their way to the CIA in Bengáza.
Obama's administration is blaming the fact that during the attack it was not officially deployed and everything and that it just hesitated what to do.
Commander Commander Commander, he'll probably release these volunteers without orders.
However, the fact that there is not one-time activity in the country, but a permanent US squad, CIA agents and private contractors, is quite interesting information.
And this is because, until recently, nothing has officially confessed, and even now it is just talking about some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the US even though half the people are trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would help to resolve the national situation.
The last secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media almost sings Iranian air forces for chasing American drones.
However, it is not known how Americans protect their drones effectively.
Of course, if there's any way we can find our drone in the airspace, there's nothing we can do about it.
However, if the Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom followed the American drone in international space over the sea, when the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He drove Phantom into check on his gun optically, without being registered to the Phantom on the radar or simply noticed it, and then when he suddenly appeared with him and invited the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without a repute.
There's nothing to wonder if the Phantom is an aircraft of American production, which, however, remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been working out recently, defenseman or reserve Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to representation after a year.
He's also good at shooting, he's got some activity, he's got a fine kick at the game in Teplice.
Viktoria sahaled in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end, these two duels took one point.
František Rajtoral believes his team in a game with Jablonce is going to break a bad series.
We want to show that we know how to win.
"I believe that we will defeat Apple at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The manhood is preparing carefully for a heavy match with the Severocechs who play offensive football.
Everything's going to the game with Jablonce, the coach is preparing us well, as we always draw a lot from the video selection of the game opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts Czech representatives of fans on the Doosan Arena stands.
The last match was done as she wishes, but the word of the crisis is against Victoria's defender.
That's how football goes, sometimes you have a good form, and sometimes you get worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe that on Friday we will win, and it will be good," says defenseman of the West.
A man named Victoria will once again rely on the support of fans.
"She's playing Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them," he adds Rajtoral.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a move at all, but a big leap - jump a few years back, and that's to the memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash the dishes, evaluate and do your homework.
Although these "obligations", that was usually just a theory, parents' wishes.
Praxe was completely different - running from school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play with the other kids ball games, jump a shot.
Then, during Helen and her boys' show, embroider the celebratory tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after a few notices, finally wash the dishes, wash out, in winter bring the wood into the duckstones and tasks to work after dark under the lamp (or rely on the classmate and instead of writing the loved ones addressed to school love).
In the morning to eat homemade strawberries (from true fruit, not those which are sold now, whose content next to the strawberries did not lie) and drink it with tea of dried herbs that Mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the tomb silence was in the maid when my sister and I recorded radio songs on tapes that were loudly rolling in an old tape car to my mom.
And then we turned the tapes on the pencil, and we let one of the same songs over and over, our favorite one, and they sang the phone to it.
Or we've been on the phone over the table using cans that were tied to each other by a string - and since we've already heard the phone to get better, it was necessary to clean our ears, then the ear was a sisser + vat.
The minimum wage was more than three times less than it is now, and my parents were able to live out of it so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPadys or even mobile phones and notebooks or brandy clothes.
The dress took place from generation to generation, and the best "circumcise" in the wardrobe was a battled t-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics we had enough to be satisfied with the mentioned mom's case and the maximum of Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on a train on a school trip.
We came to play more interesting games with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said to go "no" out.
When I was a bit older we got under the video player's tree, I'm sure his parents had been saving him for a long time, but unfortunately, he didn't warm up in our house for a long time.
My younger sister used to climb into him, said he was so beautiful with the tapes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping even a spatula.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's what happens today, poor man, always on the plate from my dad.
He says when Lenka was little, she used to rip her head off into a video and she thought she'd play her recipe and didn't, so she can't make it tonight.
I remember how we could all communicate, make a deal without a phone, a computer.
My sister and I made a deal on vacations with our grandmother's daughter's granddaughter next year, when we'd meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that's how it was, so it was.
We're back together.
Now promise someone to see you next year?!
I also remember the winter when we were running outside with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill by a church on sacks of simmered hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we heard the sister before each dinner that was well known: "Be washing your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have a tap attached soap in your lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" by a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with Mom on the floor, leaned against the feet of a duck stove, opened a door, and watched the flames and listened to the creaking of wood that fell from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't figure out how many friends on the social network we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write daily messages through various chats, texts.
There was nothing like this, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at albums, where they're carefully glued by the black corners of black and white photos.
And if I don't know how much I was then, the back of the photo is always written a year to get a picture.
I'm looking at it as though we didn't get too close by the pot, and we had two bigger pants on our brother's pants, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not even IN).
And I'd rather go back to the reality.
By 2013 and I'll wait for what modern times will come up for my children, maybe once.
What I know for sure is that my memories are now for a young teen generation so at least somewhere "twent years behind monkeys" and I think they're missing a lot, that they won't live either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung, and Huawei are being sued because of Nortel's patents
On Thursday, the Group which owns thousands of patents that disappeared from Nortel brought an action for violation of the patent against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was credited with Nortel’s bankruptcy in auction.
The Rockstar Conservium, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, called for a U.S. District Court in Texas Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei, and another four companies for a patent breach.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violation of seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps combine terms found on the Internet with the relevant advertising, mentions the action, which is the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to be found.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google gained $12,5 billion from Motorola Mobility, which was motivated by a partially group of Motorola patents.
"In spite of the failure to obtain patents in the auction, which are subject to the dispute, Google patents has infringed and continues to violate," states the action.
Rockstar is seeking a higher compensation of damage from Google because it believes that Google is in violation of the patent, as the plaintiff claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from the outside, from four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
First, she put down a smile, the one who was always taking away as a defense from a friendly neighborhood.
That made her so relieved because it was a mask that she decided not to lay down in public.
He was honest at home only in days when she was grandmother and had grandchildren around Elinka or Adík.
And of course, when the sons called.
She remembered her lesson from endless courses of business skills.
Now they've really hit each other.
So she won't ruin her loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a disguise on a mascara.
November, no other month can do the miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt lists the first elected President in office
Muhammad Mursi composed the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day was only difficult to conclude political disrest in Egypt.
ISLAMSTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was put into office as the first free elected President of this country, after Hussa Mubárak, who was set up 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first free elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth head of the state from the rejection of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 Judges turned to black plates in a mansion built with a view to the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and the second republic," Mursi said during the ceremony on TV live.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, a six-year-old engineer trained in the U.S. and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been in the majority of 84 years since its creation as an illegal organisation of sharp attacks by governments.
When Mursi arrived shortly after the 11th hour of local time in a small car colony, they guarded the building of hundreds of soldiers and policemen.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the court's building to celebrate the President, and unlike Mubárak's presidency, traffic was stopped briefly so that the colony could pass through a busy road linking the city center to the suburbs of the South.
The personal prestige of Mursi, ridiculously referred to as the non-arrhismatic "reservoir" of Muslim fraternity, strongly grew from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also of all those who want to lead to the end of rebellion against the authoritarian Mubárak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi said, "to the blue social suit, with a red cow to the judges in the wood covered with an oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo, where he was to present the inaugural speech.
While he was in sight, he got an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
He was the commander of the field marshal Husajn Tantava.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal “The arm and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bast of Islamic student movement in the 1970s.
Mursi composed on Friday's symbolic oath to Tahrír Square, in a place where the revolution was born, which ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubárak, and solemnly promised to seize the presidential powers taken away by his office by the military council, which took them from the forced leader.
But, with the agreement of the official oath to the court, rather than before Parliament, as is customary, the will of the army has been given up, indicating that the fight for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos they'll probably be police specialists to ease the tension.
In ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should operate in the future.
They'd be spending half their time here.
They'll keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people around them.
In his proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior calculates this.
He believes that improving the country’s situation would help mainly "rich social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and fourths in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They were living on 80,000 people, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She beat us up.
According to experts in the problem locations, a hundred have been added.
Relationships between their residents and others are escalating.
The anti-Romani marches took place in several places.
People from the neighborhood joined the extremists.
According to the inside, security and order are difficult for police in areas with ghettos.
The essential condition is that 'resistent application of equal access to enforcement'.
But he said that it is impossible to achieve this without the detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go to walks in the ghetto, where he would spend half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
He'd be keeping an eye on order in the problem area.
He would also know the locals, so he could deal with problems or barriers better.
"Thanks to trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of illegal acts," said the inside.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges, namely 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (at this point EUR 15,5 million).
The Czech Republic is paying 15 percent of the total, 85 percent of the funds.
The preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities has been incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special cop would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money for these members will be available to the police after the project is completed every year.
According to the draft project, first chosen policemen attend internships in Slovakia.
In this training year, five dozen members should pass.
The best candidates will come from them.
There should also be special training for police officers in ghettos.
According to authors, the situation would help mainly social housing.
It is said that it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the notion of interior, three categories would have.
Minimum standards would meet hostels with exactly defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller flats.
Higher standards should be social housing, which would be comparable to current housing.
The recruiters would have to carry out an integration plan to build social workers with them.
They would have to follow the housing order, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate them, they would go into a higher standard of housing.
According to the interior, the housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation of "integrated environments" grows.
The social housing model is preparing ministries for local development and work.
They're supposed to suggest it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhliřský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Carbonary Hill is an excellent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntall.
Together with several others, the proof of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník in the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruption was here at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, there is an striking white upon the top of the Uhlir hill, which is shown by the Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary helpful, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrim chapel.
The hostess who stood next to the church did not behave.
Shortly after the church was finished, the alley was planted out of four lines of flip, long about 1 km.
The cross road to the Uhlir Church is already the third version, the original was here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops are wooden plastics, which was made by the local artist butcher František Niel.
He used different kinds of wood from the area of Low Jeseník.
Similarly, the rock stands from the area here form an interesting geologic exhibit.
The name of the sponsor is also given at each stop.
The coal mine is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venushina volcano (almost 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born to explode.
With it, a large amount of volcanic ash, along with rock fragments from the substrates, gained red brown color by burning.
At the end of this phase, the lion surface has eroded - today it is a layer of porous jaw up to 13 meters strong.
The second erupt threw out red, brown red and spot to black tubes.
Their layer is as strong as 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the lobby wall.
In tufess, the striking volcanoes are up to 1 metre, and the second eruption was ended with a lava relief.
At the end of the volcano activity, the lions today formed up to 50 m of a strong layer of a silhouette jaw.
Volcanoes that alter the elimination of volcanoes with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made of layers, they got the name of a stratovolcano.
The original volcano was gradually subject to erosion.
But he was threatened with a heavy rock on the south side of the lom.
The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tufs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The effort has been able to stop under the pressure of experts and the public and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is the resistance and the small cohesion of the rock, which is rapidly distraught and fall down on the slope.
Lom is leaving so quickly.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slopes is the ideal place for some rare kinds of plants and animals.
The axle is therefore problematic, but in time it will have to be chosen and maintained by a characteristic geological profile.
It is not new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You will reach the Uhlířský vrch after the green tourist trail from Bruntál, or from Slezské Kočov.
Automobiles can use unpaid parking at the start of a flip alley where a short learning trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent more of her life in an active villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful villas in Prague on Oráchovka.
The original owners of the house, however, obtained it back in the restitution, and the tenants had to move small distances.
Ivana therefore quickly sought a replacement housing for herself and her older mother.
From the famous received tip on apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but a view from the fourth floor on an extensive forest park and a dam overwhelmed me on the other side," recalls Ivana's first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a commission for, like, three years.
"Today we live here more than 13 years and not only because of gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter moved from a hundred-meter apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual management lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite a good state, but they had to make the necessary adjustments, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, however, the owner most defectively sophisticated and unnecessaryly large hall, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
A multifunctional living room was created with the connection of two rooms.
Architects used to define individual zones and a breakdown of the sadrokarton room, which enabled the new position of the light.
The first intervention she decided to after a few years was to remove the yarn in the living room.
The apartment has changed to 2 + kk, but the room has won airtight and has opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step to partially improve the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivan didn't know much about the bathroom.
I've been picking up housing magazines for years looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So I approached young architect Kamil Doudier on the recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," said Ivana.
Thanks to the bathroom reconstruction, the bathroom was also able to adjust the hall available.
The architect connected the bathroom and toilet room and double door with open wings replaced one of the slides, saving the place.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
The high-quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower is a comfortable seat, with a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudier continued.
As part of the show How the dream takes place quickly but a major change in the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, a dining, living, and sleeping into the space that was formed by a combination of two smaller rooms without helping the classical principles of optical separation, for example, half-ways or Japanese walls.
"That would break the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
Originally managed to separate the sleeping area and the living part.
Two sofas were enough to turn their backs, and there was a peacefully-made cabinet on the feathers.
The dining corner defines the shades of floor and paint.
On the floor of the kitchen and the dining corner, an architect of quality marble used, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
A kitchen corner, if necessary, covers move panels with wallpaper.
The new floor of the antiallergy marble has many advantages compared to previous laminates: softer non-slip surface without clutch and better sound insulation.
The system of clicks and angles from the seedlings of the colour highlighted is a demonstration of how you can work in the panel with space.
I left the colours on the architects, wish it was joyous.
"I love oranges, the same shade I had in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphic work with the motif of a blossomed magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose white, which was under the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books among others, even into space under window windows.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled on a distance.
In the transformed interior, contrasting new with the older ones works perfectly, for example with dozens of years of old crystal mirror and quality artistic objects Ivana collects all her life.
The last one came for the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner looked a little bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and moved the location.
The furniture in a simple design is custom made, the white area softens a slightly pearly surface.
In a small space, the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher came in with an ideay solution.
The view of the small kitchen revived the all-glass wall cover over the working board.
Unique graphoskl with a digital printed theme is attractive, in addition to this, it is very well maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolia, which resemble her favorite neighborhood, in which she lived for years.
Now it seems like she's happy here.
In the original bathroom was a small bath and a sink, the new owner chose neutral shade of the lining.
The large shower box has a glass door Ronald.
The task was to create a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We have united the interior material and colourfully and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and easy movement around furniture and accessibility of objects daily needs," adds Kamila Doudierová.
The Supreme Court has decided: The time may not be pursued.
The Supreme Court has decided that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed prior to the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
Only procedural immunity, which relates to the speeches in the House, protected it.
In the case of former Members of ODS Ivan Fuxi, Mark Šnajdra and Petr Tluchorze decided, on the contrary, that they could not be punished for any criminal offence until last November, before they gave up the exercise of the parliamentary mandate, spokesperson of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
This decision was rejected by the Court of First Instance by Iva Ištvan, who wanted to pursue criminal proceedings with the Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of speculatory posts in state companies for giving up their mandate and not doing problems in approving laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts.
With Wiesa Bárta, an anti-corruption police officer was arrested as well.
Bart's advocate, Oldrich Chudoba, who represented him also in the case of alleged VV corruption, also did not want to express himself too much, but said: "Yes, I represent the client as well as in this matter, but, given the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment on it."
According to the case law, the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Bárta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the server, first transport.cz, the case could have been related to the case of former police President Petr Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to be appointed to Bart's office.
However, the last information the rights show that the arrest of Vita Bárty and Petr Lessy are not related.
A spokesperson of the police bureau Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case of Prague city representation.
"We will not comment on this question in relation to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesperson of the City State Representation in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová.
It is precisely the plaintiff of Bártov who oversees the matter, and thus indirectly indicates that the case file or proceedings are being held under cover.
Reporter Novinek managed to catch the wife of Vita Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence on Prague Klárov.
She was just putting bags in her car and driving away.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bártov was arrested by the leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura movement.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the kauza.
"Bárt was one of many candidates for many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of direct democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárt, who in recent early elections to the House in Plzeňský kraj has failed to run for the movement of the Dawn direct democracy Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt bailout of public affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The sentence was changed, and Bart was dismissed.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Jaw, lust and enthusiasm I still have
The family has always been the first to sleep, which is why she wants to give her up in her 38 years.
He'll either get a job overseas and extend his career or he'll definitely end up with hockey.
"I want to act as Daddy and my husband."
"I look forward to it," says a hockey player who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Even though he's a declared worker, who's never gonna do anything wrong.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, he can shake his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive Columbus player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is always," he says determinedly.
Maybe he'll be here, allegedly New York Rangers, who didn't make it to the season, and they've got two wounded guards-- Rick Nash's attackers and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like coming to Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as there's something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know the article came out in New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
There wasn't a delivery anywhere that really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have some contract, but it just isn't.
Haven't you heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's going to get into a situation where the contract is really coming.
When a player gets hurt, or someone doesn't get hurt, and the manchaft doesn't fit.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, right?
He's injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't come into the season, so there's a chance there, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality that I have to live in.
On Friday, you're leaving for America, are you expecting something to work?
I have the expectations since July 5th, when the free-player market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa with my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
He's given by being a father and a husband, and that's what happens.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I have no contract and I'm not playing games.
So I'm gonna do my daddy and my husband, and I'm really looking forward to doing it.
On Sunday, Vasik has two hockey matches for me and my whole family holiday, when we can go and support our kids in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in full-time carriages?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for knee surgery.
And I've had a lot and I've had a lot of fun.
One day, it goes into such a phase that all the goals, victory, and matches won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could've happened to me besides my family.
Did you have a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's an NHL, or is it because of the family you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, the first place - except for the family - is also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
That's what family lives are all about.
My children, then sorry, our children, mine and my wives, grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be very happy to continue this trend.
Because what we're gonna do is, in America, the options are somewhere else.
This is the chance we should offer them.
So you're planning to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice as we do now.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in winter, back in Tampa or where our footsteps will lead us.
It's perfectly perfect to be still warm.
I was very lucky in my life.
You could say I went across the street, it cost me a lot of power and apologizing, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But hockey in return offered me lots of options, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where to live with our wife.
There are a lot of people in the world who can pick out what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you have the will to work in you, to train hard and wait for the offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna be there.
That can't be planned.
So, you can say that this season will wait for it to blow up and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage when I'm going day after day.
Recently, the Director-General of ČEZ announced that the decision on construction of the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant was postponed to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and agreeing Contracts of Difference by the Government.
These are the reasons for the current management of ČEZ trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to major shareholders.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations, not hide behind him.
The government, only with Saturday.
Andrej Babiš begins to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that she will have to go straight to the government to make any of it ever.
Chairman ANO admitted it in an interview for the Law, which comes out tomorrow.
ŠkoFIN is trading and marketing led by Abraham.
Its competence includes the area of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludek Shantor in office.
Abraham has joined his career with the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech Republic, then in Fiat Czech Republic, where he was responsible for seven years for the brands and dealers of Alfa Romeo.
Its last place was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which over five years he held the position of the manager of the automotive division.
The ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Police evacuated for shooting part of Los Angeles Airport.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of that, allegedly it was a terminal of three.
The Reuters Agency, which appealed to the California media, claims that law enforcement men have been shot by a rifle of a armed man.
Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, reported that there was a gunshot wound to two to three members of the Transport Security Administration.
How many people have been hurt, and whether there are any victims, but still not obvious.
Firemen are talking about an event with more injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military planes reportedly bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakija on Thursday.
With a appeal from the U.S. government's last name, CNN announced it.
However, the Israeli newspaper on the explosion in the alleged warehouse of missiles was widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The Israeli army spokesperson refused to comment on an inquiry by CNN.
"We don't speak to reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the U.S. government source of missiles and related equipment, which, in the opinion of the Israelis, could be transported to the military movement of Hezbollah.
AP's appeal to another U.S. Security Officer informed that Israel's target was SA-125 Russian missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of attack, but according to DPA, the batteries of Russian missiles type S-125 Nev.
In addition, there was also a sight of SA-3's batteries, including the command center with the radar to track missiles and their targets.
The missiles recorded are expected to reach 35 kilometres according to the Israeli television report and could carry the heads of a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has already been bombing the supply of missiles in Syria for at least twice this year, reports CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would hit any weapons supply designated by Hezbollah or any other terrorist group.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated its estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from recreationals in Australia and Great Britain.
The Travel Office now expects its annual base profit before tax to be between 325 million and 340 million USD compared to 305 to 315 million USD from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 % increase in relation to record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight-percent profit in the first half and that the second half started to grow in particular in Australian and British travel outside service.
"From today's date, our 10 countries are profitable and a few are directed towards record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is where Australia and Great Britain belong, which is traditionally our greatest profit creators.
Business with recreational activities has recovered over the second half of Australia, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Britain, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
American trade has recovered from its loss during the seasonally weaker half-years and is expected to bring third-year profit in a series of years.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher than $38.20 yesterday.
The Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to St Petersburg
Environmental activists detained from September in Russia because of the protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
It has been informed by the AFP Agency today by reference to the Greenpeace International Environmental Organisation.
At the same time, they claim that the initial accusation of its activists from piracy has not yet been withdrawn.
"Greeenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that three hundred men and women, held in Russia for an inviolent action against the oil platform in the Arctic, were transported from the detention facility in Murmansk to the St Petersburg prison," said the organization in the statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; the DPA said that the planned transfer was a planned result.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, which in the event of condemnation threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that these charges would replace them with a milder trade, for which there was a lower penalty of seven years of imprisonment at the upper limit.
However, Greenpeace noted in today's statement that the acts of piracy have not yet withdrawn as promised.
This means that arrests are now being charged with two crimes.
A powerful investigation committee last week has announced that piracy charges will be replaced by a riot charge.
But when the thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not withdrawn.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone," the AFP quoted Greenpeace.
The Russians arrested three tens of the Greenpeace movement members originating in 18 countries on the gasprom oil platform in mid-September.
The Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody against which they have filed appeals, but the court has rejected them all.
The environmentalist is complaining about the conditions of imprisonment.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to AFP, today stated that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in a new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he pointed out.
For help, the Dutch King Willem-Alexandra requested one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called for their situation to be discussed during a scheduled meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Russia.
He claims that Few people have a great share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of also fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At times of English literature, at least one Shakespeare's play, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction have been studied since 1914.
The test will also include "covered text" in order to encourage deeper reading;
The combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to have a language exam, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to pass radical change.
For other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, who oversees the graduation exam, reveals changes in the school exam structure, together with the new branding system and the smaller volume of student projects.
In his speech in summer, Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there is “a wide consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain our trust in society” and that it is necessary to insist that the exam is “more demanding, more ambitious and stricter.”
The study shows that English schools spend less than 116 hours per year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
In order to compare school in Australia, they spend an average of 143 hours per year and in Singapore some 138.
Even though there will be no official requirement to pay more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive mathematics exam – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the resultant ladders – will probably encourage schools to provide further education.
The teaching plan will focus more on "problems from the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer at the ČSSD I am not me
Prior to the elections, a long-lasting dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was fully burned.
It all culminated by the fact that Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to court because of the undemocratic formation of candidates.
However, kauza activists did not want to express themselves too much so that they do not harm the party in front of the elections any more.
Now the voters are numbered.
Management of the Ostrava ČSSD so immediately on Monday night invited Mayor Ostrava to step on the side, and it will probably push even to lose his function.
Peter Kajnar wants to fight next.
What matters in disputes, and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview for Denik.
How do you feel about the election outcome?
I'm sure the ČSSD was counting on a much better result.
Has it harmed us that before the elections, disputes in the media have been resolved inside the party?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the ČSSD?
For some time now, I think ODS has been going through, and unfortunately, such things have been happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, powerful people who previously expected to find their precedents at the ODS, moved to people in the ČSSD and influenced them.
It's also related to the fact that police and computer collects after the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate.
This shows that the ČSSD is not just composed of people who want the good of all others, but many are thinking primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two unsustainable camps in Prague, as is seen in the current fight for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
It's been a long time, though.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just the announcement of what was now happening in Prague.
Haškovo's wing gradually planted positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotkovo's wing.
One is in a political situation where people sometimes have to compromise.
But everyone has some internal border where those compromises don't go, and that's also my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaralko that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkova's wing as Mayor.
Hask's wing turned it down.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hasek?
I think she is a person who is always talking primarily about the CSSD program and to some extent also about the visions for the party and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a fight for power regardless of everything and against the positions of the party.
According to me, what Michal Hasek has performed in Prague has now ended his political career.
As you noticed, you were not approved by the ČSSD Ostrava government for the candidate.
Political parties are based on competitions, who are placed from their members.
This competition should be largely based on program visions and the ability of these people to fill those visions.
But of course, people who do not have powers or visions are also reported in this contest, but the political party is for them a lift to money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead of each other by breaking the rules without scrupulousness, they break the position of the party.
In my opinion, they are making political parties to the mafia, breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
Warn me about this problem is more important to me than to consider if Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the opinions.
That is why you made a preliminary ruling before the election of the court against the form of a candidate from the ČSSD in Moravskoslezsky Region?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava strengthens its power by allowing organisations that do not comply with it to cancel, to operate, to step up a new organisation, to throw out uncomfortable members of the Party.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the representative's club, but he brought an action against it, and then they'd rather canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that being able to comply with the positions of the parties through the courts is the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The efforts of the Ostrava ČSSD management led by Member Adam Rykalou are to call you back from the position of the Mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Porruby Lumír Palyza has a reluctance for this post.
It's true, Adam Rykal and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me back.
They promise people's positions, they win votes, and then they strengthen their power in the side.
When I go back to the past, everything that might have happened around the football club Banník Ostrava and purchase the Stadium Basel was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could describe me as a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city has purchased assets that are strategically valuable to it.
How, then, do you see this further with your perseverance as the Mayor?
The district committee has already asked me and other people on Monday to consider our adherence to the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Get a thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy, who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than crossing everyone else to see where they're looking for.
Will you still fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe any party will be able to drive effectively if it cannot drive itself or itself.
I don't think I'd leave the ČSSD right now, because I think the one causing cancer of this side is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historical centre of public rink
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Burnen stated that the preparatory work on the rink was launched on 26 October and from the centre is in operation a aggregate for ice production.
The ice layer is already strong seven centimeters, and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The swimming pool has an area of 375 square metres, the podium took 358 square meters.
The skaters and the passers will also have two booths with punch.
"We expanded the floor surface, increased the space before the stand and almost the whole area covered them so that skaters could easily shift," said Burned.
Olomouc Street is already resembling Christmas.
Last year, the rink for repairing the Lower Square was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the Town Hall in Horní náměstí.
The correction of the Lower Square was completed on the glass of summer, so the ice area could have returned to its original location.
For the first time, people could have dirtyd in front of the Council in 2009, when the rink was operational from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural programme, will be launched a month before Christmas.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlín will again be dealt with by the Regional Court
The National Court denounced the prosecution of a 25-year-old Slovakian and a twenty-year-old chastity for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the blame.
They're threatened by 15 to 20 years of prison or exceptional punishment.
spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the court's court's decision was lifted and the case returned to him again.
The reasons that led to this court refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the charges, the young men were attacked by a seven-seven-year-old man in his home.
Senior died in a life-threatening state of death.
According to the charges, the men strangled him, beat him, kicked him all over his body, and also his metal object, probably his gas gun, set about three dozen wounds to his head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain or hemorrhage to the brain that he ate at the site.
Young people reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth some 14,000 crowns.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition, indirect evidence against the defendant's scent marks, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although, in more than ten cases, the smell marks from the crime scene and others were consistent with the defendants, the police initially referred to them as factual and not smelly feet.
In addition, she found out that she was having some doubts about handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendants have not been shown to be guilty without question.
The court, however, acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he'd probably fallen and hurt himself.
The violent death was not even reported by a doctor called for rescue services.
Criminals had been contacted by Olympic doctors after a few days, who had discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime that the relatives had cleaned up.
There was no DNA on the scene of the defendants.
Young Slovak lived in Uherskohradiště.
Now he's serving the chastisement of 8.5 years last year, which confirmed him by a competent Olomouc Supreme Court.
In his opinion, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men, who was aware of the robbery of the gold industry.
The Loupes became in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopna.
Younger of the accused of murdering the senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him in August after 11 months of custody.
Znojmo starts with reconstruction of the stadium
In early November, Znojmo started reconstruction of the football stadium.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who performed the lawn reconstruction.
The reconstruction of the town stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close the luck of the Fall Struny week
The saxophone grandeur and legend of Wayne Shorter jazz scene will make the next Wednesday a dot for the 18th year of Struny Autumn Festival.
Shorter will be performing on 6 November at the Grand Lucerny Hall together with his quartet, composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter's adaptations to the symphony orchestra, Pegasus will begin the composition of the new album Without A Net, as well as its older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although in August this year the 80th birthday celebrated, Shorter is still full of strength, which also shows that the Prague concert at the Fall Stun will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The number of interpreters he worked with is from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Jon Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he met also with Czech musician Miroslav Vituš and Viennese native Joe Zawil, with whom in the legendary Weather Report after more than one decade they gave direction to a new style of fusion.
For the last 13 years, she's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Some sort of afterparts after the festival will still be the club night of Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to Andrea Triany's charismatic singers, the Dutch audience will present the Manchester Trio Go Penguin with its jazz-affected electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring electro-jazz formation Profund Bass inspired by dance styles.
The Damek said he forbids UEFA to publish sanctions for the referee.
Dagmar Damková, President of the Committee of Judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has ceased to publish punishments for the judges.
She's banned by UEFA rules, which she said in her legal interview.
Otherwise, it would be a threat to FAČR.
The lady also rejected her function as a party to the Plzen football players from where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are from somewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6,” said Damková in response to a criticism that erupted after Plzeň played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, in recent months, FAČR has stopped publishing sanctions for the referee, Damková assures that they are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me that if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict the delegation, whatever the game was," said Damková.
The reason why punishment is not disclosed is the Dame ban on the European Football Union.
"The EUFA prohibits and criminalises such information."
"We're suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I got two very strong warnings that if we don't stop it, the hard sanctions will come," Damková said.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were truly an exception," she added.
If the disclosure continues, the Commission could be able to lose money from UEFA to the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without these, we could not fill the program on the lawmakers' education," Damková added.
The Bárta detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is it worth leaking wires?
On Thursday, police arrested the Prime Minister.
Together, he was arrested by the Head of the Department of Analysis and Informatics of Anticorruption Police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the listenings of Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Paul Béma (ODS).
The news server News.cz has confirmed the Czech Press Office a trusted source.
The listening phone calls by Janošek and Béma, published last March by the Mladá fronte daily today, in which both men address each other 'Mazanka' and 'Kolibřík', show the influence of Janušek's action on the steps of the town under Bém's leadership.
The diary then stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) was commissioned, two years later, from which they disappeared to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bárt owned it.
The server News.cz pointed out that the arrested crimeist Petržílek worked before he joined the anti-corruption police just for BIS.
Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption department, which subsequently engaged in interrogation at the same time as it was published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can't confirm anything at all," said Michal Muravský of the City State Prosecutor in Prague.
He refused to confirm also that he was monitoring the case.
The case doesn't want to comment on either inspection for the same reason.
Six companies from ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies from 10 have been intensively preparing the upcoming efficiency of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporation Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company's asked representatives indicated that the two key codes did not address the issues at all in their company.
This results from a survey by the law firm Ambroz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found out 108 Czech companies.
In the coming period of effectiveness of the two key codes, only at the last moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize what may have a significant impact on their company's business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our view, be affected by all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually occur because of policy-lifting.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to switch to new law for their companies without complications," commented the results of the partner Ambroz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spátil.
Of 61 percent of companies working intensively with new legislation, 26 percent said that their companies already took all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Therefore, each fifth company has not dealt with the reconfiguration yet, but has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent of the opinion and the issue cannot be evaluated.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that the recodification issues have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent) for the largest number of companies in question (16 percent) followed by the resolution of commercial conditions (16 percent) and changes in the catastro real estate and in liability for damage (after 10 percent).
For contracts, one of the most important news of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel amendment in both civil and commercial law will disappear, as a result of which the contractual law should become more transparent for both citizens and businessmen.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new amendment will offer a lot of news with a focus on greater freedom of arrangement of relations," pointed out lawyer Amberz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný.
In connection with the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider it essential to increase the liability of statutory authorities.
Furthermore, they follow topics regarding changes in calling and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impacts on the statutory authorities, especially when companies threaten to fall or fall into it.
"In practice this means that if members of the board of directors and directors of firms do not deal with the care of a proper householder and do not reverse the threat of a company's downfall, they may lose the benefit of having obtained a function in the last two years," he added.

Putting through the mud, the river and the jungle and providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical attention to villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for CNN Hrdino Prize 2013.
You can vote for or vote for any of the ten main candidates in the CNN Hero Award 2013.
The winner will gain $250,000 so he can continue his special work.
For the past 21 years Georges Bwelle has watched his father again and again fall into unconsciousness and drives to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaunde in a car accident.
First, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed a infection that spread to the brain, creating hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father into a crowded clinic and hospitals where he got the treatment he was just available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of patients in there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one physician per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Doctors could visit, many could not afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwell.
They can't live with poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team made free 700 operations last year.
He himself became a heart surgeon at the central hospital in Yaunde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 have been helping with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cling to the supply, attaching to the roofs of medical needs and travelling through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Incontinently, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive welcome as real heroes: reception, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation a community can offer.
In these villages medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and unsattained energy – it is very willing to engage in local cheers.
The next day, the team is starting to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every journey," says Bwell.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers away on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires a school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing simple operations under local narcosis tonight.
Operations are usually done in the school building, at the city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient is getting up and goes to the recovery site to release the next patient's seat.
With light from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and its volunteers work in early morning hours.
It is exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay up and continue working, play drums all night," says Bwell.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of webcam doctors and foreign students of medicine – performed free operations last year 700 operations and realizes that their assistance can mean a lot to locals.
One man said that after surgery, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change the future of our family," said the man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and working a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital at night, he works for private health clinics around Yaunde.
He says that this second job is about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when to sleep” says Katie O’malley, who is second year studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and working as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and nursing services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle's mission, it is a great practice that they would not get at home.
“To Dr. Bwell we thoroughly washed our hands and removed the bloody spots, or held the instruments,” says O'malley.
It's like a second year medical student in America.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and will often arrive with donated medical needs.
As soon as they arrive in Yaunde, food, transportation and study provide them with Bwelle.
"He's definitely a hero," says O'malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, he's not a burden to perpetuate.
Helping others live happierly, fulfilling the promise that he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this job,” says Bwell.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
Smile people, ease their pain – that's why I do it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Chief Sisters for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of health sisters whose number in the Czech Republic is over 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses should have a representative within the framework of the structure of the Office - the representatives to whom they can always contact," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister, and I think the field of nursing deserves his attention from the Ministry as well.
This profession requires not only high professionalism, but also human attitude and personal conviction.
"The Council and all responsibility will try to enforce those steps that can improve the position of health sisters."
"We have good nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients too much to perform their professions with all empathy and help us in public eyes, the picture of sisters improves," says Alena Šmíd.
The newly appointed Head nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, on the occasion of her introduction, also stated that she would like to address various aspects of the position of the nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educated people, other non-healthy professions and doctors.
"As a matter of fact, I do not want to separate the profession of doctors and sisters, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to me, each having his competences and together with other health professionals forming an integrated work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I meet a number of problems that occur during the occupation of sisters, these difficulties I perceive and intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of health care and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the nurses' administrative tasks make unnecessary burden and take time for them to give patients," says Alena Šmíd.
The other areas that it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways for better cooperation between the team and the management of health service providers, adapting competence and labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Act or non-intervention of the sister's insufficient number at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steaks, which, however, are not documented on a particular case where the rules could be violated.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the functions of the Czech Chief Sister could serve as a guarantee to maintain anonymity of such a complaint and leave the competent authorities in a particular situation," says Alena Šmíd.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Health School in the Faculty of Health and Health (in 1978), and the Philosophical Faculty of Charles University in Prague, in the study programme Health Care - Education (adapted in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the department of nursing and other non-healing branches and recognition of qualifications in the Faculty of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at a bed in the internal department, continued as a teacher at the Central Health School, where there was also 8 years of statutory deputy director.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Vězeňské obsługi ČR.
She published several professional textbooks of care and articles in specialist journals, focused on teaching activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
So I won't bow down to hate
Václav Kahuda's writer returned to write for 12 years.
After many years of reading, he lived, but did not write, published by VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new novel of Wind, darkness, presence.
That it is not a narrow union, it suggests a number of parties comparable to its most famous parts of the Dutch (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved that after 12 years of silence did you write a novel?
I did it - not to bow down hate.
Seeing around all the time new and new clones of the human foolishity, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lusts, vexláke souls and vice versa overlaid ideologists who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small sold bitch.
At the beginning of the millennia, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos, and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain getting out of life on this planet.
I like to go for walks and read a book at night.
You're talking about the feeling of loss, hate.
Was there any break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
Evil was a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name at the time.
Well, that's what I've been living for.
But there's still a surprised silent boy in there.
I see another single exercise, every one in his own anxiety tornado.
I was saved by writing books.
I take part in this defensive, thousands of years of lasting movement of the system of life on this planet - the spread of the incomprehensible future.
The immense breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when by way of temptation there is another generation of beings, which in billions of interaction per second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from zero?
Self-loathing, or a better dialogue that leads to the right and left half of the brain sometimes flows out to the surface and forms in the book.
As peace periods are touched by silently sleeping metastases of wars, which may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed into words.
I felt that a silent avalanche of life is growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, then one day, it's quietly crushing me.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated, and it puts them in layers that are stored in the darkness under the level of consciousness.
The Neoortex, the gray cortex, is a bird of old evolution formations, goes to the ancient letcuses of the brain tree.
He speaks to the married beasts, asks snakes, searches for the answer in a bird's flight, lifts his sight to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky over me.
Eventually, the brain is asking the world.
You're speaking relatively often to an egu metaphorically, can you define it biologically?
The brain retains all memories, experiences and experiences that man has experienced in his billions of connections and electrochemical relationships.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched trees with information, memory registers, uses the brain in its discernment, cognitive, process, being exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unscrupulous effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes you get overloaded.
Analytically - as if you "fall" PC, from a language emulator program and translators from foreign languages would first get involved in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended in a dark greenly flickering Bios screen, in a basic system that manages functions and cooperation on a butterflyboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who haven't understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psychospirity crisis.
Do you often mention it - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the presence of functional mechanisms of our thinking, feelings and behavior - there will be a break.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "So long he looked into the abyss when the gap looked into him."
It is clear that man is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "dead" and new quality occurs.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer the parable.
Once one fell into the tunic and drowned, the days, months and years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - so to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps someone will help me write sentences like they used to help Hrabal's lyrics to me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a specific person who will read your text?
The one who cannot be told of any meaningful, some call it knowledge, another super ego, but I think it best characterizes Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader participates directly in the process of word and sentence formulation."
Since the early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, he sailed in the submarine of Captain Nem, running through Stins in the dark streets.
In the same way, behind all this branching of authors and their message, it is "The Sun of Light Worlds of Other Karl Hynka Mácha".
And if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the feedback that comes to you through the people that read the book, do they?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
The books are actually "life" or better said "world".
They are encoded in the characters of the letter, have experience, the history of the regions of which the language is written.
Whenever we can wake them up to life, let their branches flow into the brain.
In fact, in a way, something forbidden by the divine - awakening other and further life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit to witchcraft.
After the publication of the book you - as it is - are waiting the chain of author reading.
I remember you once loved reading.
Are you going to get into it again with joy, or do you feel different after years?
I'd rather tell you today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic character-- they're inconvenient, they don't look too much at each other, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec was alive (and I hope he still lives) one pure bookkeeper (the name is occasionally July), a happy friend and a good girl's bull.
In one drunkard, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my Housian book.
I looked them in the eyes, and then I was shown a crushed, numbered copy of my book.
In despair, I put away just a decomposed jitra and wept briefly.
We all stood there, we all woke up and drank drunkly with milking tears.
Then the young blond man couldn't stand it, and he jumped out of the window into the snow curtain.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and there were happy angry sensitivators, a painful soul of fellow countrymen and a steak of fallen patriots - they poured and walked like werewolves till morning.
Every book of yours is both formal and content different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text of the Wind, the Dark, the present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country behind a nitwit and a devatero mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts the words of one of the old Russian myths in the mouth of the people on the island of Bujana.
She's got dogs, she's got gray truffles on her.
Awkward, terrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell once before and lost - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it again on the free tide of inspiration?
Answers are eternal - Otokar Marchin.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something enormous and unmistakable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depths and in such a width that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so, of course, we do exactly in the intention of our programmed arrangement.
We are rewarded by the inflow of dopamine, a mixture of endorphines and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in defense and get new personal territories.
Sometimes it becomes a malfunction and we break our compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human beings.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the ocean unconscious and into the spooky sails made from the dirty handkerchief caught inflows of bottled wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of announcements from Republican providers in recent days, they blamed the President of US public fraud.
Yesterday Obama has been conned by his original promise.
“The great majority of those who have functional health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the “start in the media” about the statements, Obama invited Americans who received these notifications to search for new insurance premiums on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care programme at the same price or even cheaper than they expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population purchased by the insurance for themselves may be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on available care.
"I say this to these Americans straightly: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Act on Available Care, said that the launch of the Internet market went “worshipful” since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
She spoke yesterday to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place following a stormy exchange of opinions with Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who concerned whether she had to be involved in Obama's Care Programme.
More than three hours during the hearing at Sebelius repeatedly wondered why “architect” the Act on available care did not voluntarily give up government sponsored insurance, and he did not purchase a programme through HealthCare.gov, who is now forced into millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, PPF Group owner, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations, and according to various resources from the agencies and behind, the hand is already in its sleeve.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the LTE auction, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG.
It was under the brand Sazka Telecommunitions that entered the auction frequency for LTE networks.
And that's a general surprise, until then, the company's taste didn't talk about getting into the telecommunications system.
But Sazek now leads the very experienced telecommunications lubricator Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing head of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the head of the Slovak T-Mobile and was the last head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sack plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admitted she wanted to run a virtual with Vodafon.
And it gives it logic.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not like Vodafone in normal circumstances, but according to the information of the Hospodářské noviny, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an O2 and T-Mobile competitive agreement that will fully share its networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazza.
If it succeeds on the LTE network (as a novice can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to release the auction at all, and it will not be affected by a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone may share the network with Sazko.
Vodafone launches Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network on the 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
Between that, a costly LTE network will begin to build, which Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend the money on a fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovenska branch is the daughter of Czech Republic) he would have received immediately a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big pier waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, LTE would have won Kellner already for O2 and very probably in conjunction with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafon, T-Mobil, Kelner or Komárek.
Or two Titan Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever go around without signatures?
The era of President Zeman has advanced with the legendary scene with the ashtray, and so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gather evidence of overloading the castle satellite.
In the past, the ancient influence of this Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Harder nobody's documented this way to sign it.
True, the leadership has become editors.
However, the cases asked do not answer the question of where such favours of some journalists take to the obligors - whether they are responding directly to the order, or in order not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of illegitimate empathy.
And when we are assuming that we are all over the world, we cannot forgive the question whether the change in TV ratios do not seek different, or less unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is those who say that in developed countries there are no short-term attempts to intervene with politicians.
The truth is, however, also that does not mean that there are any complaints about public law media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be the tendency that they own, which is the fruit of their subcultures.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation is not ours.
But maybe in a country that thinks of itself is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of evil politicians and good journalists spend more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an unsightly situation, in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings reflects each other.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: the presidents on the edge of force
It is almost a rule that the head of the state was not in such a shape in key moments in order to fulfil its fiscal obligations.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, we could fly flying abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight for its legitimacy there.
And most importantly, the capitulation doesn't have a hangover nation to this day.
Benes was not a prosecutor, and within Munich was still in shape, but during the war it was already started off the hill and in February 48 it was preserved accordingly.
To be better about it, he could go to exile the third time, and break the legitimacy of the communists and their knocks.
It's a shame to talk about Hech.
He was elected "Mr. President can't get into a situation where he'd make decisions."
But he had to, although making great decisions with a knife on Hitler's neck at the office probably wasn't there.
The sequence of intelligence František Moravec in the last days in March 1939 said what should be done in order to ensure that the occupation he knew of the day precisely did not run so smoothly and with such profit.
The Senate president and cowardly government didn't do anything, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human care of Gottweld was executed by his flight comrades, as Moscow commanded him.
Ludvík Svoboda has definitely made it impossible to share in normalization and had to settle it, which was already completely senile.
That Husak was powerless and sickly depressed old man's actions in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only reason.
Havel was lucky to have not met him in office for the past years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that mental processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now here's this.
The head of state and chief commander of armed forces looks like we don't know yet.
Fortunately, now there is no danger of an external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it threatens, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (in historical terms) well that the President is not at all strong.
But it's not normal.
Can't we choose a president in this country once again who's an acceptable thinking and acceptablely healthy person?
Remote planets, black and white films, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth, are not themes that American jazz saxophone player Wayne Shorter would be giving up ice.
In the concept of his quartet, which on 6 November in the large hall of Prague Lucerny will end this year's Struny Autumn Festival, all related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's jazz saxophonist quartets are current feelings of musicians.
According to his appointment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are about to experience.
Music comes as a completely improvised chamber matter and thinks not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is a freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, carrying nine Grammys, a local teammate, Miles Davis, and today probably the biggest living jazz saxophone player - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the view that it was best to be surprised by life.
"A lot of people are planning everything, and then they are disappointed when things happen differently," said Shorter.
How insects from Thailand picked up the markets of the Paris bar
Maybe you're stuck with insects, and you don't know you're gonna eat it half a kilo a year.
For example, he was grounded in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and your unique experience is also taken care of.
The offer included an insect as the first in Paris on the menu's menu at the beginning of October of Eli Daviron, a cook and owner of Le Festin Nu.
A bar for which the name was an inspiration book by William Burroughs Naked lunch would be found in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartru of a generous tour.
With a fresh avocadom, baked with red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, the new guests can bite not only different maggots, locusts or water bugs, the scorpions can be enjoyed here.
Carefully and specially packed vans (not to harm their wings, to harm their feet or to harm their eyes) Davirons send to Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneer menu indicates just a few reasons why to consume insects.
The first is environmental benefits, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (as far as finance, space and water consumption is concerned) than for traditional meat.
"The insect is an excellent source of protein and omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young cook does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a feeling of sin and an atmosphere of environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably want to know how they consume a bug from a decorated dog, but the customer's reaction to a served insect bar is very positive, according to the owner.
Even the sceptics will eventually taste it, even though it begins with the smallest bites, and they will eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Company of entrepreneurs in construction in ČR Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been dealing with a continuous decline in procurement volumes and an uninterest in the state about investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
There is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, provide considerable amounts for heating but also chances for construction companies and building materials producers.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 new jobs.
In terms of fiscal policy, the leverage and multiplicative effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
The association of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic therefore largely disagrees with government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue further so that further challenges can be raised within it.
REPORT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and went to the castle in Láná.
What condition is she in?
In the unprecedented confession John Kerry said that the American spy “was gone too far”
John Kerry indicated that in some cases the U.S. defense position had been misplaced with regard to his monitoring programs and said that in some cases, the espionage was “too far.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that Barack Obama, together with Barack, was responsible for the fact that, with regard to the angry discovery of the NSA spying activity that appeared thanks to an informant named Edward Snowden, they acted as an “audit”.
Published information generated a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video-connection to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been done because of the possibility of being, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of cold war and then of course September 11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government who admitted that the American spy had crossed the border, but pointed out that it had not been violated by anyone's rights.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain this to the people and to clarify it, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to set themselves apart.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and throw people into the weather and attack governments.
What if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings were not destroyed, and people have not been executed because we are already able to learn about these plans ahead.
President of the Senate Sub-committee on European Affairs on Thursday said that American legislators are preparing for Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American espionage, and convinced Europeans that they need to continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other people and that they're worried about their threats, that he would stop participating in counter-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed with the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the United States' national security interests, it is really important that Europe stay with us on one ship, taking into account the joint efforts to combat terrorism, he said in an interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party, and the President of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together with terrorism, regardless of their anger over NSA programmes.
News in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, disrupted relationships with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were unobtrusive and reflected the incomprehensive metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents that was told by Snowden that the NSA had followed the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other 34 world leaders.
The director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the group as necessary and said it was both sides of the common issue.
In the middle of his ulcers Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary journey that should take place this year, and hopes that both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, names of other legislators who are willing to engage are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the journey is to help repair relations, he added that “a well-meaned educational measure will also be prepared.”
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about spy programs that they use for years.
"While we are adapting our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, they also have to realise that we are not the only ones doing the spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East this weekend and to Poland to respond to malpractice that has already developed an American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as an American follow-up activity.
Australia appealed against a stay in Thai prison.
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to fifteen-day prison on Phuket Island when she untruthedly claimed she was attacked by taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially charged with a court of land on the island of Phuket on the wrongful charge when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who were holding her had attacked her in the morning on Sunday 10 June.
However, the record from industrial television later discovered that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police had two days interviewing Bamford before she came to the conclusion that she had invented the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a detention facility with low security in Phuket County instead of being placed in an adult female prison.
She's the daughter of a former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who requested help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Syrian Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“Evidently this is a difficult period, but we hope that it will return safely to us as soon as possible”, Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail 50 000 bahts.
In the meantime, reports from Australia indicate that she spent holidays in Krabi's recreational area in the south of Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claims that Bamford represented a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a court proceedings that would increase her sentence and bring her to adult imprisonment.
However, after the recent murder of Australia’s employer, Michelle Smith’s travel agency in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct the busy picture for tourists, which may have just been worth liberating verdet.
I'm a joker, a brother's goal?
He won a puck in the defensive belt, and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jágr scored like this against Tampa at night on Wednesday, on Thursday night then 119th NHL winning goal commented on the Facebook social network.
"After looking at this video, my agent Peter Svoboda called the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I should be interested in making a commercial on their latest train, Pendolino!" wrote on the introduction with the over-raise Jgr.
They say we're very much alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to end up with night practice so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid then the Minister of Defense might call himself, and he would like to make a commercial for the jets!" he added the smiley ones.
In addition, New Jersey assigned a second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - Maria Rottr's treatment is taking care of," Jágr concluded.
Place of authorisation of the trade mark gulš
The October elections rather than the winners brought a lot of losers.
They are not only parties that have not reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPO), but also the previous government party (ODS, TOP 09) and, in the end, also the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us instead of Christmas candles on the weekend of the Occupational Guláš.
The Skokan election became the movement of Andrei Babiš, which promised voters to change the current political style of governance.
The disparity of the election result and the split in the winning party is recorded by the political (from) will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who have publicly supported President Zeman, nor have they elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the President lost a strategic lead in front of other policies because of an unpleasant event, he still had several ways to get him back - for example, by selecting a future Prime Minister.
While ČSSD’s chances of obtaining the Prime Minister’s chair in my eyes have given up, the entrepreneurs of Andreju Babiš are drawing closer.
Although the electoral development is still within a mere and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the legislative scenario of left-wing communist government, this is a development for business in the Czech Republic and thus a better report.
In view of the loud resistance of the ANO to be combined with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (total 111 Members).
Due to the collapse in the ČSSD, which has become an incomprehensible and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The Minorial Government of the ČSSD consisting of the "nemeronovists" in the Castle is probably not going to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened with unsatisfyed ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead sooner or later to the next part of the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to contribute self-patch to the next premature elections?"
Other elections would rather be a referendum on the force of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
The plans of the ČSSD to introduce sectoral taxes, to increase taxes on income or to build up state-owned banks are more likely to fall under the table.
The Parties to the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and the Dawn, on the contrary, will be able, for example, to promote business, sober fiscal policy (government deficit under 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The three areas are most experienced in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would rather be to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is eventually a better result than a left-wing tax program for everything that's still moving in the economy.
