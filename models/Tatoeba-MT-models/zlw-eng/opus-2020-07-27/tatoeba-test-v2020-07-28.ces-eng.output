If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's my map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, even when I was invited.
Are you still here?

The ancient customs are dying out today.
Tom's still busy.
You better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry, I just came here to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.

Who's Tom going to visit?
Tom's responsible, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I don't know what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised if it happens.

According to the Tueby Directives, it is recommended that members simply add sentences in their native language or translate from a language that understands, into their native language.
