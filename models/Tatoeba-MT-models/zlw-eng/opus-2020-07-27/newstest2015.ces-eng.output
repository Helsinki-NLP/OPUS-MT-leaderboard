Petr Čech: Transfer to the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance comes in the winter.
Petr Čech, now a spare goalkeeper Chelsea, but now they don't have a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in a funny NH Hotel, speaks to Czech journalists and is preparing with Czech representation at the game general with Americans and then also for a sharp start of qualifications about Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic, first in ten years in the London club, received his position as alternate.
Before that time, it speculated that Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Pohhar in battles with Atlétik and did not manage to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
It was also related to the interests of Paris SG.
In the French league season he won two reservations and two remiries, and on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Pretty much pushes the shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and on weekend he broke up with Lille mildly 1:1.
On boulevards of English sites today, there were reports that Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Bohemia’s departure from Chelsea has not been very likely at the last moment.
Skybet wrote a 4:1 course on it.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the uniforms within the last few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe there will be an offer during the day that won't be refused.
What kind of offer would she have to look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't yet know how such an offer that can't be rejected is actually looking.
It would have to happen to all sides above all, it would have mattered at Chelsea's position, whether or not the club would have a solution.
Is it technically feasible to do such a predicament when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new area?
I didn't think about it that way.
But in this situation, there are a lot of players today, they're all in representation meetings somewhere, and I'm sure there's a lot more to close tonight.
So somehow it would be realistic.
How many clubs on the planet that might afford you?
Well, I don't know.
So you don't push out?
The situation I missed in the first three games of the new season is new to me after fifteen years of careers.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and leave.
I want to continue to participate in this fight for the goalkeeper Chelsea, and he's at the coach who will choose what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into consideration.
Of course, there is a sporting perspective for me, but I also look at it from a personal site that, of course, belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England too?
That's the question I thought would never concern me with.
But anything in football is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old motorcycle chase
They stopped the bike after the zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and ran 125 km/h and went to the bush to escape the police.
The patrolling traffic police tried to stop a blue bike by the side of the road this morning when they noticed that when they left the pumping station on Bathgate Road, they were driving 125 km/h.
According to the driver's police, he didn't stop and proceed to Burgess Road, and then he hit the bush, so the cops lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person who matched the driver's description were then seen in the house at Walcott Way in Bulgare.
The Carrath police accused a 20-year-old young man of disobeying the challenge to stop and run carelessly.
It's September 23rd to court in Karata.
The motorcycle was packed for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man will be brought to court for assault charges against women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was introduced to the charges during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He was supposed to be in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry on 7 June 2013 in Perthshire to rape a woman.
According to Webster, she was attacked while “she was not conscious, asleep, and was unable to give her approval.”
Furthermore, Webster is being prosecuted for rapeing other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland from 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring a very American ideal that working rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the union as civil law.
"As unions work, jobs work for the middle class," said Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be together with the pattern of occasional rights John Lewis to introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade unions, such as for other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-disclosure forces
Edit the law on employment relationships so as to allow all workers who face discrimination if they want to participate in unions, to judge in the civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation - is a good and necessary initiative.
But I'm sure it's not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellis, Lewis and other law-makers are putting forward is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union struggles that took place in the recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when a country in one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracies of Hideki Toja are replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in forming new Japan, took their tongues into them, and openly recognised that “the right of workers to gather, to negotiate, and to act securely.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged Germany to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism is replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote in the new nation and therefore include a clause that openly says: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will limit this right or seek damage will be repealed. The measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Human Rights Commission, proposed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global contract, the applicants and Roosevelt guarantee that “everyone has the right to create unions in the protection of their interests.”
Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create trade unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in an equivalent partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are imposed in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize themselves in a free and open society and to promote.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today everyone knows the union didn't change the power of the nation, but it's extended.
They've raised the standard of living millions of people, created a market for industry and production, raised to an unstucking level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't either.
The formal recognition of employment rights as human - and the extension of protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that brought America up and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge temporarily blocked the Loisian law on Sunday, which, according to the lawyers, would probably shut down all five clinics carrying out abortions in the state.
The Regulation, signed by Governor Bobby Jindala in June, to enter into force on 1 September, would require physicians carrying out abortions to have the right to receive a patient in hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry on legal abortions and, in the meantime, be required to provide this authorisation.
‘The proposing party will be able to legally operate and, in the meantime, obtain a permit,’ stands in the federal resolution of Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
Activists for the right to take a resolution that is the last one in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"The decision today provides for women in Louisiana to be safe from the negative law to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics, which were not between the complainants, and they also request the granting of this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states which have approved similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi claiming such measures to be anti-avoidable.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the rights of women to abortion together with the Association of American midwives and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permit is imposed on a physician which is not necessary from a medical point of view.
The miscarriage opponents were taunted by the fact that measures were intended to protect women's health and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed for measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has indicated that only one abortion physician has authorisation in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop making abortions, this doctor would also stop the procedure because of his fear of safety, say the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said that they would not punish doctors who carry out abortions while waiting for an application for the right to be given.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, killing ovarian cancers more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video with a tribute to their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovary cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analysed the medical records of over 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
Susan Jordan’s head research from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
MALA STUDIE: New medicines can slow lung cancer and ovaries
Women's researchers followed during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the survival rate affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who have been diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas, there were about 20 percent higher probability of dying than women in urban areas during the study.
Although the study was not designed to determine why it was more likely for women outside the city to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“It can’t best treat the gynecooncologists who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome a barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programmes to support people who heal far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer was low regardless of the geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today by Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of owners of their homes
According to the HTA, published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of owners of houses under 35 years of age could lead to a “main age group of gardeners” reaching 10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes spend on average 55% of the amount they spend on their own.
As other factors that threaten the sector that accounts for an estimated £5 billion per year, it shows an increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, a sluice of pavement instead of a garden used as a parking area and a shrinking garden size.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses dropped from 61% to 43% over six years, the household is one of the lowest expenditure on horticultural products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have said that living in a sublime or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden counselor for RHS, said: “There is a very popular growing of plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “old age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity in the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he foretold a higher drop due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin at the reunion of his youth organization, which most closely reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved with atomic weapons and basically gave everyone their opinions stolen, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I feel like the current regime in Russia is showing many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can control both the high nationalism and the minority can transform them into imperialistic desires.
Time seems different eastward than west.
While the western world thought that the time of the war over Europe was long gone, in the east he thought that they had been ignored for a long time and had to regain his international position.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis could grasp power, and then there was an explosion of nationalism that was not like the present situation in Russia.
And then the completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beat of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination between minorities and homosexuals, that is, of course, quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and I'm sure a large part of the Russians, probably missed after Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking ahead of them.
Probably the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe few Vladimirs used to pat on their shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted him to go and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
You did order at home, and he was like, "He didn't want to go anywhere," and he was banging his knives at home.
Now he's decided to go back to his lost position.
It starts slowly, it's time.
The leader is probably in life, so where he'd be in a hurry.
He grabbed the Caucasus, now the Ukrainians are on their way, then they're on their way from the Baltic.
The Russian bear has been snooping in the fur for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice that one, too, who's going too far, and I'm sure he's making a run for the Far East.
And the Germans are also pretty angry about how well they are, and I gave it to their ass in 45.
How about one new Novorosju in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and ours are a lot of them, and how they were printed there by the crowd they wanted to tear down some of them.
After all, our veterans have so far remembered how they were supposed to be in Czechoslovakia.
Well, because their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he's going to break like onions and I'm gonna eat all of their EU.
It would have been so much fun for the great Russians to jump out.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as a blast, we'll use our soukmen who live on their territory.
The Russians are pretty much everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just printing them, and we're not gonna let them go, we're gonna protect them.
And again, the Russians will rule, for what else it is born for.
Europe is only as good as a foreman who is proud of Ivan dancing a goat.
Turkey has brought forward the U.S. diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highestly built U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British spy activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the U.S. charge d'Affaires and Turkish civil servants acted on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that, according to the documents provided by the former US National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was the priority objective of American and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, the Turkish president of Recep Tayip Erdogan made the point of the report and declared that all the important states were following each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence services also focused, caused a more bitter response in the Turkish government.
The game on the thrones presented other tricks on the fourth row

Police Director in Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, complainants submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in Calvia's own area of law.
The police director in Calvia on Mallorca's holiday island was arrested after charges by uplifting businessmen and barkeepers in an infamous holiday district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballena, a street in which most bars and night businesses in Magaluf were charged against him.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet daily, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants in Calvia, on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police because of the connection to corruption charges and together with Navarre, they'll be heard by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted unrest owners of night companies, according to which public officials have a serious impact on their business.
"It is not long ago about making money, but about survival," said one of the businessmen in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main page of magazines all over the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which provided oral sex with 24 men during the tour.
Since then, observatory authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and outlaws among the participants of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcoholic toures on bars.
Moreover, the Playhouse club, where the event occurred with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the tour organizers at Carnage bars to pay a fine of 55,000 Euro (EUR 77,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, was also a witness to many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day marked by rain and storms which had an impact on the airfield at Adelaide airport
JARO brought to South Australia an ice surprise, it came with a strong rain and a sharp wind that really hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to occur in town until 9 hours in the evening and 6.6 mm later during the night on Sunday.
The last rains introduced together with a few short crossovers associated with the storm and wind storms that began eight hours ago and brought about 4 mm of precipitation within about 10 minutes.
After last week's winter, several early spring doses fell on Monday temperatures in the city again to just 15.8 °C.
It is believed that storm weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virginia Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land shortly after 7:30, but at short distance it hit a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to land.
Winds at the airport in Adelaide at that time reached around 50 km/h on earth.
Flight data indicated that the plane had to drop since the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused further flight delays, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to predictions, they can reach temperature on Tuesday in Adelaide at a maximum of 16 °C and one or two crossovers may appear.
Israel’s children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near Gaza moved back to school on Monday after they spent summer in the bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas on their homes they attacked missiles and minerals. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is recovering from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in the south of Israel marked attacks felt joy and excitement, but the signs of fighting are still apparent.
In Ashdodu, a city in the south of the country, a kindergarten worker hit by a rocket, removed remains from the wall after the roofs and slowly expects the return of the children.
“We are a little afraid, but we are otherwise looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad Kibucu and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children from this area really need to get back to everyday routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that "it's a little weird" to go to school again.
"We've been having a rough time and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the people.
Until the end of the war last week, thousands of border villagers like Saad remained inside their homes or their homes left and went to a safer area from Gaza to escape missiles and minenomets.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, the village near the border with Gaza, in which the missile from Palestinian Minomet killed the four-year-old, with the return of weight.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study closely, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to be an unlimited peace.
Although the ceasefire led to an immediate end of the fight, it did not solve key problems as the request of Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian Gaza block and reopen the Gaza airports and ports.
Israel requires the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questioned these figures and estimates that at least half of the killings were radical, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired in the war on Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country of 4,591 missiles and minenomet missiles.
The Israeli army has taken over 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza and estimated 250,000 people to be hiding in the United Nations School Shipyard that have turned into a temporary shelter.
For tens of thousands of people who are still in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, they put the school officials away last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in Gaza’s largest city.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
And Laphat suffers from heat
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory game with the US and the subsequent initial qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Out of the 30-year-old caste, the Spartian attacker David Lafata, who suffers from heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably had a little bit of trouble.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said the journalist, coach Pavel Vrba.
"If it's two or three days, or tomorrow will be fit, it'll be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or participate in a game on Wednesday with the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan backup of Luke Vácha.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, but others were also middle schoolers.
I decided on the basis of Luke being a forward-looking player of 25 years.
The decision was very difficult, but I'm behind it," said Vrba to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not ruled out that, in the case of health problems, nominations might still change.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, the liberal Josef Šural, who gave the hatrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see how David Laphat is doing.
In case he can't be available on Wednesday, I don't claim that I can't dominate any of the players who are interested in the Czech league," Vrba noted.
This afternoon the representatives of training in Strahova, on Tuesday then classic pre-war training before the duel with the USA for Summer, which will be open for fans and followed by an autograph.
The game with Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the National Team will strive for a premiere victory under the Vrbou.
In the previous three preparatory games he played two remiries and lost once.
The qualification struggle with the Netherlands is then on the 9th of September from 20:45.
The wheat is going to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba likes to have more time to practice, unlike previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players eight days and you can practice certain things that we don't have so much time for before.
Now we can only focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally follow the former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
He's giving us information that's from the game.
But it won't just be him, we'll have a game filmed and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased most over the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the capital of the Australian RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1% in August, the housing price was reported by the Agency on Monday.
The increase resulted in a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase increased to 10.9%, more than twice a year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are in charge of the market.
RP numbers Data show that Sydney's flat prices increased by 16.1% last year while the prices in Melbourne were 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra was placed on the other hand, which damaged the State’s ordered reduction of expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of real estates for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a real test for the market.
‘With regard to the persistent high levels of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the housing value will increase even further over the next three months,’ he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hired me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaica's immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory had a colder relationship.
Henry's trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixing reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "privileged" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice say: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the croquet.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, were adults - with him they walked into a bar and discussed things like a glass shape with beer or a beauty of punch in a croquet.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry visited the Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than his father’s time, he saw what life had to be for him.
There's a little bit more light out there today, but it's still dark, it's a bit dark, it's a smokey, stinky labyrinth, where the flames are going up, and there's smokes and so forth.
Dad always got in the tub, and he was just lying there, and then it was heard how he slowly starts singing for himself because he's washing up the founder.
When I walked around, I realized he was doing this for years to feed his family, and I started to respect him more.
Even though Henry had a childhood without a parent's love.
Dad didn't hire anyone, said, "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started calling ourselves "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who was with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love that he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French married 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't we be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to stick to the drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's hard.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat carrots themselves.
The change in the direction of Henry's career collection may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he got the credit from critics for his Othello, he was immersed in the theater.
She followed Commedie full of mistakes and August Wilson's fences.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy that filled out his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage giving someone a couple, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-70 ’ s: “For long I was the only black imitator/committer on TV. ”
He learned at the march.
Except that she had to notice me, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make fun of working jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the stage production rights The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which actors changed into blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was being rude about it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and I learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years appreciated by the British main product", but also was "grotesque parody of blacks".
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that also mocked the British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was, among other things, known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade, he took ads, documents, television shows and roles in films, but after sending away his LennyHenry.tv to the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're gonna do now, Len, it seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next was the documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
First was Shakespeare.
I had really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we talked to on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he's already in it.
It gave me a feeling I could do it.
It's like it's giving me courage.
“It’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the text, find out about it.
So the testing was hard and I read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedia full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for theft of the audience.
"The man in my head said, "If he corrects the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes."
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
It could be someone else to solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay a part."
Henry in Word at the Duchess Theatre
Learnting the plot text was a challenge.
The panic is pretty good, adds commitment.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like a divine sign that says: “This is what you should do.”
Of course, it says with a voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be in the rehearsal.
Henry still remains a comedian's brain - all the time our conversation interrupts with humorous performances, when he enters and comes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-up because having satisfaction from a room full of foreigners is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but it doesn't make me happy anymore.
I asked if he'd ever organize some stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director, who helps give outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine on non-permanent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove from the government's payment list of non-permanent employees.
According to government statements, employees who do not register in the following two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after the state service has left.
After the office took place in 2013, President Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in government.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state comes at least one million dollars per month on payments of non-emergency employees and further abuse of official powers.
The government suspect that payments are still included in bank accounts even after the death of the staff member or after the staff member has left the government administration, says the BBC reporter from the capital of Naiobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must enter the identification centres for the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, shall be indicated in the declaration of the government.
He also says that anyone who does not show up without a sufficient excuse will be excluded from the payment note.
"By giving real public service employees this measure will contribute significantly to its economic exploitation and will also be used to clean up the payment list at both levels of the government, and thus solve the problem of non-emergency workers," said Anne Waiguru, the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested because of a "scene" against the government
The local media states that in Turkey, 33 police officers were arrested because of suspicion of a “community against the government”.
The police department has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were 14 highly built officials in custody.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organization of a criminal gang and a phone call.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) called their action as part of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine opened again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents as well as the Prime Minister Arsenian Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had opened up again, but that the country decided to defend for the next generation:
Not at all schools, the traditional ceremony took place at 1st September.
Not all over Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
All Ukraine, connected by the Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastetukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, visited by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will help them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the kids wearing a snuffed shirt, bringing balloons and teachers to give flowers.
In the Year of Fairhead, perhaps the BBC found the head of the hard times
He brings with him a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of conservative parties.
He has experience in the front lines himself.
The career began at the Bain and Co consultant's company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
Seven years was the Executive Director of the Financial Times. She resigned as the highest position in the parent company Pearson's occupied by her younger colleague.
They say her distance was approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former BP, when Cameron needed a private expertise in Whitehall: she became a government councillor.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the principal's work as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC extensive and complex entity in the centre of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
Corporation is turning two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the NCB's own management, but also out in public in times of restlessness when things don't work.
This is almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming to a company complicated as a Chinese dynasty, decompensating it and thus preparing themselves for a job.
It's a heavy challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC getting smaller - her power, her finances - and how her status is revised.
With the expansion of competition and the new technology questioning the old certainty, it carries with it the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC.
With a modest amount of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and it costs only 40 pence per day.
Moreover, the Bank's promise is clearly rising: 53% of the supporters compared to 31 % of the years ago.
The use of BBC services have changed: Today, news headlines show up on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing warden-- I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the offensive tweet
Tweet of the official twitter account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated the criminal charges of Perry's abuse of authority.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which he dissected from the previous one.
My account left a tweet that wasn't authorized.
“I do not agree with tweet and I have downloaded it,” he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
Previous tweet published an unfeeling, humorous image of the state attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was condemned to run drunk in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the money for her office, which Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a grand jury in Austin.
It says in the tweet, "I don't always drive three times the amount of alcohol in my blood than the limit is allowed... but now that it is, I'm suing Governor Perry for calling me responsible."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry did not lead Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was designated as a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and accused by a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge to reject the charges because the use of the law to prosecute the longest serving governor in the Texas history is counterstoppable.
Perry cut off the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Public Interest, which is based in Travis County, and is under pressure from corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal caused a formal complaint by a left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it'll be famous.
After the fifth place in the committee of his party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to the speculation that he might have ended up with a picture of him running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns to "the normal"
One of the most prominent London developers companies in London warned that the housing market was “back” to normal levels of activity in South-East England.
Living in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and increased concerns on credit bubble made it possible in June Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and Chairman of the development company for the demanding customers of Berkeley, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the highest point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market was successful during the decline, because buyers from abroad flooded the capital city.
According to the date of the Catastral Office only in the last year, prices in the city increased by 18.5%, which gave rise to an average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing prices from Berkeley increased by about five last year and reached £422,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening librarianity, the foreign buyers of London have not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also threatened to introduce new property taxes and talk about possible "sustainable tax" with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections of next May.
London’s real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will slow down the growth rate of the market at both real estate and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data from Bank of England showed a decline in the quantity of approved mortgages in July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced by the fact that home prices have already dropped, its forecast for London's real estate prices to 3%.
The volume of transactions according to WA Ellis' real estate office has since decreased by a quarter in London's most expensive quarters like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing, because it increased cash for forward sales to over 2,2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and therefore the forward sale remained stable.”
In June, the company reported that from the beginning of the year to the end of April it sold 3,742 properties, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to GBP 380 million, by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before Pedgeley's annual meeting, he said that the annual returns of Berkeley were expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley's stock stopped this afternoon at the London Stock Exchange at 23.96 librách.
Hacker online posted photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Award.
Oscar's owners' photos Jennifer Lawrence avoided the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have “a sign” photos of another hundreds of beginning actresses.
The spokesperson of "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were true and the hacker criticized for "a clear violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who steals pictures of Jennifer Lawrence publishes.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the server for sharing images 4chan, reportedly acquired through the gap in the Applu iCloud internet storage system. The reported list of photos of the hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at the photos we and your husband took in private home years ago are happy with each other,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice known from the cable TV series Nicolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the pictures would be true. On Twitter, she said: "These alleged naked photos are DVRH, people."
It's better to cut it in the crack.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the pop star spokesman Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary demonstration from the praised new novel Howard Jacobson about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved themselves, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spread out as a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, sharp, isolated, and maybe a little bit plausible.
And then she shaked his hand.
He just admitted it.
He could fuck like a bullock, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the starting love loop that promised him that he would be relieved of his lonely life's boredom and possibly give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild hair and a overflowed heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and hostilities than Port Reuben.
To the south came with an older companion, who Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaked, the vans were dead spiders, the slimes signed on the windows, as if they thought they belonged to them, the garden was growing, and the weeds resembled the huge noises of the green.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at Man Booker Prize 2014.
The next week's selection will be announced.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in a large grassy chair and held their hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, inadvertently tuned the public station, which the country provided with comforting music and calming news, when the sight of her tanned legs reminded him of the old song long forgotten by the black comedian comedian who was happy to listen to his father.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they never played such songs in radios.
They were not forbidden - there really was nothing forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get into desuetuda, just like the word desuetudo.
People's taste has proven what would never have been possible by regulations and positions outside the law, and as well as people with regard to books, the memoirs, in which poor people become rich, cooks and love novels, are choosing ballads in music.
Kavern took his day off and started playing the imaginary piano and the rude, comical voice singing the Serenade to Aillininini's big feet.
Ailinn didn't.
“It was a favorite song from the jazz pianist Fatse Waller,” he said and automatically added two fingers to the lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was a kid.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you started with the words that started with her, you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you an inch.
It wasn't very funny back then, and it wasn't funny at all now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard one.
Nor jazz, though it was directly built outside the law, did they play.
Improvisation is out of style.
There's only one place in life for one thing.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she'd end up.
Same for humor.
His unforeseeableness has made people nervous.
And jazz was a humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Ailin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time when she liked singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure, either.
The slow society is one in which each part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were happy by chance saving - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Karib origin, with temperament and constitutions, were fine for fun and athlete, and so they sang and ran.
People originating in an Indian subcontinent, like nature's gift to electronics, took responsibility for no family being without a telephone.
The Poles left were the plumbers, the Greeks, who remained, were the dishes wrong.
Those of the Persian Gulf States and Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while they were doing what STALO was doing, IF they were afraid that they would blame them for putting them in the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would spend the next time - they opened a restaurant where they sold the weak ones and smoked water pipes, didn't look at each other, and they slowly digested them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn is hard to understand how a simple word that Kavern just sang could be created by music.
Music was the expression of love.
"In fact, they are not dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with too many legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too, but the neglected garden provided the illusions of safety.
No word could have escaped from behind soundproof letters.
Ailinn still didn't.
Why would your father like that?
He meant to say it was a joke, but he was mad at having two fingers to her mouth in her presence.
She already thought she was weird.
"He seemed funny," he said eventually.
She shrouded her head unbelievably and covered Kevern's view.
There was nothing else in the entire world but the confusion of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she doubtfully said.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not exactly the bad guys.
Maybe a little ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon for that.
"Your fat ankles just attracted me," he tried.
I'm kind of sick.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, just as his father did, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to trump the cruelty that she was givin' in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons broke and got out of the chair, dropped the radio and poured out the wine.
No wine, so it couldn't be a drink.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in the storm.
"My sickly attracts that you're an idiot," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for both her unloving words, and the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think they'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in a cold north peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was the same in the foundation as here.
They were affected by the same wide and ice ocean.
The same confusion of men, after what STALO was, even more touchy and more brittle than their ancestors, smugglers and preachers, angryly wandered from the pub to the pub, prepared to raise your hand to any woman who dared to reject them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she doesn't care, they'll show her their fists!
At first, murmuring her - it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibodies of a young ballad of love that was quenched by the radio - first they soaked her up, then hit her one.
According to Kever's view, there was too much cultivism because lubrication was an act of violence itself.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He came out of a cage like an old man.
She felt bitter herself, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched her leave, as if she watched him out of the window on the floor, the man that caught him doing what he himself did.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
The heart closed for him and for all men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, the shoulders hanging, shameful, hurt, all the fighting left him -- why did she seem to know that look well, even though she couldn't have had one moment until today, that she would have seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, by herself, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and excited, twenty-year-old researchers working in Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system Public moods, prepared a short article on the survival of light and medium-sized violent acts in the areas of the country where its mitigation or direct suspension was most expected to be incurred if sufficient money and energy were spent to remove it.
“A lot has been done and much must have done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and most of them have won, especially in the dried, difficult places of the earth, where, despite the tops of the church towers coming up above the hedges of human kindness, historically appeared only rarely. ”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower is, the lower the poodles.
Residents are breathing over sentimental packages, glamorous stories and proclaiming that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that the old brutality is kept as hard as it is in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that at home, on workplaces, roads and even on sports courses there is a new and offensive intolerance.
“God tends to be too Mayite,” said her superior.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum has bowed her head.
I also have to ask, "Are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again paid off her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking therefore,” said Rabinitz in the end, “I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unsolicited companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which is totally acceptable and commendable of itself, can sometimes distort judgment in the way you did.
Clearly, you yourself are predisposed to the Church - things you call "crust" and "brute" others could also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
He's still dealing with what he's gonna do if it happened, like, if it happened, yesterday, he's preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
In his head, Ofnow had a rosque view of the lightboard of rose recommendations that he had sent to the world for the last quarter or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicians, use your phone, chat, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silent, singing word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I completely understand your reservations,” Esme Nussbaum answered, when she was sure that her superiors had finished, “and I do not claim that the wound had not healed as we said she had healed.
My concern is that if we are not alerted to this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what STALO did when it happened.
But this time we won't vent on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the finger connectors.
It was meant to mean endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “If the steps that may have been done, and maybe your grandparents have not done, you describe as mistakes.
You also take too far to speak of the fact that they have ventilated their “circumcised” and “distrust” on the other.
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the presence, we are not talking about "us" and "it."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is it was chaotic times.
“Woe to whom, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “We are no one without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was just or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
That's not what we agree to say - in this we agree.
And just like there's no guilt to blame for someone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the repair was appropriate and possible.
But for what else is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists so we can forget about it.
If there's anything I can add--
Luther Rabinitz has cut off the finger ends.
"Your message will be taken into account," he said and released it.
The day she went to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who ran on the pavement in a way that the passers described as "brute and angry."
Coincidence happens.
The Kingdom of Lesoth claims that no coup is planning - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesoth refused to organize a coup for the purpose of the government's abolition, claiming that they acted against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country and says that the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After saying that he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister and his family left for the neighbouring South African Republic.
Major Ntelle Ntoi's spokesman said that it wasn't really about the knock, but the military's response to the threat of the political fantasy that the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho was following several news reports of the police’s presence in several groups, which are planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were about to make out in the country of the desert,” said the American Voice.
The spokesperson of the South African government Clayson Monyel said that military action looked like an attempt to lift the government.
“Although no one has declared that he has taken power by means of power, the actions of the lesothic defense forces seem to carry signs of a coup,” he said.
Military leaders of the Kingdom of Lesoth said that the soldiers returned to their casino on Sunday, and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that in his opinion, the target of the attack is because of his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's session for internal disputes, there is tension in Lesotho.
He claimed that despite the opposite statement, he did not copy his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
According to a closely monitored survey in August in the euro area, production growth slowed to a minimum of 13 months.
The final index of shopping managers in the euro area (PSI) from June 51.8 dropped to 50.7.
Number above 50 means expansion.
New orders and factories were left to damage the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The figures are from the Fourth Meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank how to deal with the distanced health of the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant to 0,3 %.
There has been speculation that Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative redeployment of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have joined during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s main economist.
The German production PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum 11 months of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are not very calm," said Dobson.
Industry's slowdown is likely to add oil to fire to analysts expecting to implement further monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing about the production overview of shopping managers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: The producers in the euro area currently have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has affected – especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly.
He stated that, as “even more likely, ” the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell of survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were arrested by Chechnya radicals in Beslan, South Russia as hostages
During the suffering that lasted three days and that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of which more than half were children
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims that escaped death during the war at school.
For exactly 10 years after the appalling occupation of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, warned the survivors of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and murdered fans of children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy has joined East and West, which has led to action and future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims that have escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the bad, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
The war that destroys Ukraine now - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a broken school gym
She was captured by a leading Russian photographer Dimitrijem Beliakov, as she was only in her underwear trying to climb back into a bombed school gym after she exploded the bomb.
A confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Lariss, who is now forty.
There were concerns that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said that time.
My legs were blood.
I got up and I came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Through three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
My knee left pieces of shard.
Her goal is to become a dentist to help people as the doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly did not destroy it,” she said determined.
“It just happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate, Mr. Gappoev, killed there.
As little as we played together, we imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget the occupation, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I lay in the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rainball and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day in Russia (the children of the school begin in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, the seven - year - old said: “Mamma told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Go away."
He was afraid that she was dead, ran, and on the way he saw the crying batole, grabbed the baby's hand and ran away with the shower ball.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother is dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was asking for her freedom and lying in the hospital with her feet hurt, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came inside and hugged me.
Damir then flew away to London (by the missing News of the World) where Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are getting pale.
I remember, right after that, I threw all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with it.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard that didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed at the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could have picked anything I wanted at the toy shop, and how I drove the cabriolet.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he suffers as much as he and his friends have suffered because of war.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am so sorry for everyone who has to go through such a terrible time,” says Damir, who took part in his voluntary work last week in a convent.
I want to be very helpful.
One day I want to work with the police, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there weren't any kids to scream and run around, and it took a few months to keep quiet.
She's alive, remembers Damir's trip to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and at the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that although it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste for a pine tree, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from the water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And that's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed to better in ten years.
Now the war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it was, and many children will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think war for a lot of people is just something on the news they listen to when they get bored or while they do something else.
I know what these people live through, what a terrible thing it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice, quiet kid, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, they don't want revenge, they don't care about that.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's got a lot close to six classmates and he goes to the gym from time to time and they're burning candles.
When he was younger, he had a problem with it - I remember when he used to lie on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lie there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw all his guns or other weapons into play. Damir is 17 today, taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I've been sure he was dead for hours and I'm never gonna see him again.
When I got up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have this hell of a chance to survive.
"I remember shouting "Damire, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her, and he ran away.
So our lives go away from others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy who took a photo after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Comfort: The survivor of Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, on the right hand of Grigori today
When he was running for his life after the Chechnya terrorist shot his classmates, he was so scared in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone three days ago," she remembered.
Not entirely, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
He only survived my Grigori.
It's still harder to think about it and talk as the date approaches.
It's not gonna take a single day for us to remember the tragedy.
We don't think it happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Fotka Grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of attack and was made as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigorij was so excited for school, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he was alive, I knew when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of crying Grigorii in San Marina.
Grigori's looking at that photo, and we're keeping it hidden in the library.
I get it, but I also think that thanks to this picture people around the world know what pain we feel.
Today Grigorij says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“ I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still investigating, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever get to know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening because if you ask people, no one wants war, just as possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
In order to forget, he needs decades.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year from school and began studying medicine at the University of Vladikakaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for health reasons, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived, even though he was held by a killer terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist during the attack, yet he could survive
When the attack was full of power, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb-killing terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," Gregorij, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can handle better - I have to say, it's not true.
“ In 2006 I went to a psychologist, and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year later - it was the first and last time I joined the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going back there, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit in a well-known picture.
Liver: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photos taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
Still, I couldn't get into health and study at the FBS Academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My other qualities are animals, so I went to the vet.
I've done a second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "the cow cat".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something that the kids should know about, and it's not something they should experience at all.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside getting worse with his anniversary coming.
I'll take part in the reminders ceremony.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is a grown-up today, but he's got the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unrighteous happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
Well, I'd say he's already out of 50%, and he's out of the way, but he can't get over it, and he can't forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and it only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I liked and they were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm in pain of losing the dead.
I know the families where other children were born, but also the widows, who had not entered again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how much my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world-- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one of our friends countries, how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who has taken to safety a special command
Saved: Alyon Tskaevu carries a safe Russian special command (on the left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
The world flooded in 2004 when a small Alyon took out in the arms of the Besla's captured Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but her 30 - year - old mother, Kristina and Brother Makhar's ten - year - old sister.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and her new wife, Lightlan, had a little girl named Kristin after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and grew out of her bright and happy little girl.
A close friend declared that “it is a great happy family and Alyon and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary recalls.
You can understand why.

4 tips to get better photos and videos under the water
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is compact such as Nikon Coolix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party for a couple of cameras, they all cost less than $ 350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but to achieve the best results several rules apply.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure your batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to which type of photos or videos you will receive.
Some cameras and video camera cameras have a stage or shooting mode that optimises the exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive into your equipment.
Some cameras are designed up to 5 feet, another one up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both regular and waterproof versions.
Always take a few shots - a lot of them won't come out.
The compact cameras have LCD cameras that will help you with the composition of the photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even though LCD has, underwater will be badly seen and the composition of the shot will be invisible.
So always do more shots.
If the camera has a cracking mode that makes a series of images with slightly different dispersion of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper sublight, the light stays significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface while taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you sink, the less colours you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's great advice, if you're taking photos on land, but under water, it's even more important because of a more interpreting light.
It is particularly important if you film with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that mutilated him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and illness, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
However, one day in 2007 he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He's been dealing with flu symptoms, and he's discovered he's impatient, and Juliet's wife includes regret.
He noted: “I want everything to happen sooner than later. ”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and unexplained.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague made him a chest X-ray.
One week before he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays are back.
He had mesothelioma, an irresistible tumor that affects the pleural or pulmonary leak.
It's hard for most cancers to determine what their cause was.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients smoked lung cancer.
Mesoteliom is different.
Almost in all cases is the cause of exposure to asbestos - the building of fibre material which was previously referred to as "male", but today it is known to be extremely dangerous.
It wasn't hard for most of us to ignore mesothelis.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when a ban on the use of asbestos in the industry has entered into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people, such as treasurers of isolation, builders, tessars and workers in the shipyards, came in close contact with him.
Toxin used in industry in another era is hard to see today as a reason for concern.
Such selfishness, however, is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemics are on the rise in Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice as many victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths per mesothelioma every year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we have only now felt its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually lasts several decades before the mesothelis develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestest was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes in which we live in, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we buy.
So the Mesotelies do not respect the social layer, wealth, profession, or age.
Privileges from London’s department stores to public schools do not represent shelter.
Parliament too is full of asbestos.
Even hospitals that should treat us are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the ski corridors Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors, and porters used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to answer partially.
"From four doctors who were in practice in Guy's Hospital and who then showed themselves to the mesothelis in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th of that year, he was 55.
To survive with this diagnosis has not been normal for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get sick with the same disease?
According to a British mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pet's best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when asbestos epidemics in Britain occur, about 90 000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Azbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at files from the archives of the courts, where the disabled often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June admits that Marks & Spencer issued asbestos Janice Allen from negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to1987, when she was overseeing two stores on a clothes section - one of the places was a flagship boat company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when she started working for M&S.
He's got two kids today who's over 20.
“I have never heard of mesothelioma before it happened, ” she says, “I have never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I've never even thought in my dream that he might have something to do with me.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
Actually, there's not one asbestos substance, but a group of six minerals.
He got his name because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibleness.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today it is possible to find chrysotil, commonly known as a white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, baller seals, and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
The dangerous thing is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain once was the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of an unusually high occurrence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Marshal & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flag shop in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His studies say that “a significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the "current use and radiation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which explored the Westminster Palace, shows that even the people in the middle of the government may not know that asbestos may be exposed.
In 2009, Goddard published a report, according to which the service elevators and pipelines behind the parliamentary Committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fiber could be broken as harmless as the "powerful air flow."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case, the opposite may be the truth.
Although the Directorate-General of Parliament services insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a ‘warranty medical certificate’, it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to examine Parliament carefully, to modernise the electricity and remove asbestos, and that Members will be more than on the green benches in Westminster, in the areas of the Alliance’s Conference Centre, Elizabeth II.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this dissatisfaction will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One of those who have never been able to determine when exposure to asbestos occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspected that asbestos was exposed to work in hospitals.
“I have worked in a hospital where asbestos has been shown,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was able to do something like a cold.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I started shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleural, leaks around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
In the end, he spent a month at home.
The confusion of the doctors made him a chest x-ray and led him to the thoracic catetre to remove the fluid from his lungs that he was sent to the analysis.
Yet, they did not determine diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he had practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the O.R. O.E. chamber and subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and was in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his physician consulted his pictures from CT and X-ray with panel experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started to feel bad, he was introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the space between the sternum and lung strength.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't very worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with sisters from Macmillan's charity organization and one counseled him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe,” he says.
For those who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Thus, Mesoteliam is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous tubes isolated by asbestos in hospitals were in the basement, and therefore it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
Of course, the staff members who passed the sovereign corridors between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it is now apparent, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could have saved their lives, but also a place that could have threatened the life of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos are removed today.
The students of Bunsen built on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbesto has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and councillors because of its excellent insulating and inflammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people of asbestos have already been exposed to school.
Somewhere in countless hours, the students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos pad.
A website dealing with asbestos in schools was launched.
The harmless items such as floor tiles or roof covers on the tools in our homes have normally included asbestos.
“It is an industrial poison built into a large amount of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember in the 1970s when she was in the killing of a garden house.
So be careful how you hurt your garden house.
Knowing that the disease is irritable, the impact of diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while for you to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't get back to life next Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the switch from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
As countless patients before him and he remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
“ I asked my doctor: “How much time do I have?
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not getting back to life next Christmas.
That's it."
Mesoteliom is especially destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us in life - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos are small fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers breathe, they can settle in the throttle, pneumonia.
Asbestos are irritable and can cause cell mutation.
“Problems represent breathed asbestos fibers in the form of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirg, who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is a paradoxically leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
The asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breath itself is pressed to the edge where the shell is located.
He's been invasive since the very beginning.
In the mesothelioma, normal therapeutic options used in other cancers do not take so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is discussed by fire.
Some say she'd be worth a shot.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the puddle," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “is not very responding to chemotherapy” which, although “has some effect,” does not cure.
“Sometimes someone survives lung cancer, ” says Treasure.
But in the end, they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot longer than expected.
The author of Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after her own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and counsellor for the same disabled.
When they called, happy introduction was made: “Good day, you reached the centre of cancer. ”
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
The disease diagnosed him four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was gonna give up.
Lawson, however, was “taught to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they searched me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a complaint, and they would have to approve his payment.
To get to the best available treatment, the issue of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments eventually fail inevitablely, many patients face other financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave behind.
That's why he's turning to the courts and wanting compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has known to be harmful,” says Morgan.
However, in the 1960s it was found that even his very small quantities could pose a health risk.
And here we are meeting with the negligence of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but Morgan said it wasn't a “full settlement” because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation, however, spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the placebo incriminate basement section was removed in the 1990s.”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Putting the exposure of a mortal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - it turned out to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma to compensate for it.
A lot of former workplaces have changed the owner or failed.
The insurance records have gone missing.
And those who defend themselves now have time on their side, which they certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to have a settlement, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve to cover the insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount which the court would normally grant to them as compensation - approximately £120,000.
Every year 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma, thinks that £ 350 million is a "good job."
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies,” he says, and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn’t hit time and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach the former employer and in a normal way to sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law " had had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths, there was a need for rapid action every year.
“People suffer too much and need help right away,” Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in charge of Professor Loic Lang-Ladzunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended a Lang-Ladzunski operation, which, unlike Tom Treasura, thought he had a positive effect.
Following the surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy - three-way treatment, in which Lang-Ladzunski may boast a survival rate of five to 40% of patients.
Abbotta made it stronger.
"This is not the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control inspections have shown no signs of disease.
I went to further control in March [2014].
I had multiple stains [s] spread in my chest.
My 50th birthday was coming.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott has retaken six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think of practical things-- financial collateral, when I die, or to show the woman how the boiler alarm works.
When you learn the bad news, you start being negative.
You need to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant that I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people called us.
Ellie was more relentless.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such talks.
However, in patients with mesothelioma such talks are not lightened by hope or evidence of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) an unfortunate certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the limitiles don't threaten life."

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the multiplying discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates by 2017.
It is likely that this step will produce long- promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists have begun to organize and to catch only a few hours after that notice.
In essence, the Chinese People's Congress allows communist leaders to rule out any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“We were not surprised, but we were angry,” said the legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear we have an authoritative regime to do.
At the defense of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee on National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s election would cause “chaos”.
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong’s Chinese administration, Beijing has promised that citizens will be able to vote in force from 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough, as Hong Kong allows direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firmly in the hands of the nomination process of the Committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the biggest and most followed protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the movement of the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened by the closure of the financial district, unless Beijing grants them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement in the rain gathered before the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement enters a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they will launch waves of protests.
But they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “was considered by the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in case all options for dialogue are exhausted and no other choice will be made.
We must regret to announce that today all options for dialogue have been exhausted and the deployment of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days and have strengthened the protection of government headquarters on Sunday and deployed police and barricades.
According to many of Hong Kong’s inhabitants, invigorating anxiety is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The arrival of land-based people increases competition in the area of products and services.
There are also concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of words are being bended by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the central occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - a rescue boat to Hong Kong.
“The trial he talks about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” says Regina Ip Politicians, who long-term criticise the movement.
We do not want to expand the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
China's state media has also come in recent days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong depict as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights to which 780 000 participants came - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
A pre-requisite?
The League of Jihlava bears the name according to the political movement
A small kick plays in the regional town of Vysočina approximately 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
The title was taken by one movement going into October municipal elections.
In addition, the head of the small kicked in the Jihlava Jan Mrák is a tenth on his candidate.
"There was a general meeting, where there was no problem," said Mr.
The situation around the first league of small copies has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the jighla town hall and they have recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
The little kick won last year according to the city's website around a million crowns.
And this year, it's a hundred thousand dollars.
In the legal opinion, the process of small copies is not contrary to the laws and regulations of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis spokesman.
I don't think that's gonna happen anymore. To catch a subsidy from the city and to express it as a small kickback in the elections of one political party.
A very similar demand from politicians has not yet come for the high-level "big" football.
That there would be a ČSSD regional section, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like the sponsors to contact us from among companies," said Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of a small football party and the movement to the name of a league doesn't let go
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the course in the Stoupech is not ours, we are there in rental," said Ondrej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava.
The Czech Mill would be the most suitable location.
However, there will be, for example, a senseless area for skiers, which is in Jihlava about 50," said Morak.
Primator Jihlava Jaroslav Cleared (ODS) that the small dome uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupy, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to upgrade or build a sports centre at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think he's made huge progress for a little kick in the last few years," he added.
The other political parties in the league have not shown their name.
We have limitations.
If one of the branches enters our partnership, we don't give the other one any more," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said the member of the Sport Council Commission Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr.Mrák uses a small group called Jihlava and subsidies to the city for political purposes," he added.
The American tradition penetrates the university life - the first-olds can fly by jet plane
We are pleased that we can answer the first luxury travel service to students in Britain.
The company also offers transportation opportunities, including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to leave the best access to the university.
Stewart also stated that the service had its own security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who otherwise have to put their things across the whole state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important freshman) variants this year we will ensure that at the university there is a minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesman said that since the services had just begun, there are no reservations yet, but he added: “Students start making reservations in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students pay annual training of £9 000, they expect the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students has criticised the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
A lot of students who enter the university this month must be able to cope with the financial crisis in the form of loans and grants that are not able to keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
The feminists, following the events in Ferguson, face up against racism and police behavior.
At the beginning of the month, he killed a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
The present who waits for the funeral, with their hands up, are like, "Hand up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, due to the shooting of an unarmed young man Michael Brown, a blogger named Miriam Zoila Peréz's blogger shift in the white feminist's online discussions.
She found that, when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, Belarusian feminists prefer pre - race feminists.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which drew attention to the national press, Perez noticed that the white man’s reaction was 100% concentrated on race.
Compared to the reaction of a black man early after the shooting of August 9, personal articles with title as “the thought of a white man over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
“I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who speak of race and privileges on such a level,” she said.
People felt they had to express themselves to what happened.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic, because [situation in Ferguson] is so racially winning that they had to draw attention to it.
According to English professors at the State University of Ohio, Koritha Mitchell raised Ferguson to the light of the problems African-Americans must face every day and which in the cultural sphere are not perceived as "female questions".
"I can publish funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 grand from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about colouring them in their own land in a trap, it's quietly debilitating.
“How is it possible that a woman can publicly talk about relationships but not about public space security?" she asked.
For black girls like Mitchell, who are concerned about race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and sex dichotomy.
In her opinion, the black girls were unable to offer luxury to share these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today have a question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, the professor of female education and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and almost in all cases the rape of white women was caused," said Hattery.
You needed a white man's cooperation to justify lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between white men and blacks came when the fighter for electoral law like Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of women or blacks can have electoral law.
“We decided to place the card on the right to vote for women and the right to target the blacks later,” she explained Hattery.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why color women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We have never helped black men protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained electoral law in 1920, it took ten years to start organising lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was created for 40 years after the black girls first talked for help.
According to Mitchell, the White Feminists’ response to questions raised by Ferguson - a question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "goat" questions that had encountered generations.
“ Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] were to take the right to raise the child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have done a career fighting for reproductive law and access to birth control now finds out what it means.
Major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they released Rebecca Carroll's column from Guardian, which required white Americans to protest more strongly against racism.
“I hope that women who have different reasons, but yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views of race that differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek change,” Stein wrote.
Although Steinem is engaged in intersexual feminism, which includes race and gender issues, her comments on race issue in America are some people's mothers.
An expert in the American Enterprise Institute of Christina Sommers, the author of the book “Who Stolen feminism?”, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are “a lot more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the notes of Steinem party Ferguson face the criticism that she caused before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little program My Brother's Keeper, who was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused a lot of feminists, including Gloria Stein's angry reactions.
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police arrested nearly 66,000 young people in the southwestern country this year without their escorts, the issue of reforming immigration laws has once again arisen - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization of mobilizing women for reforming immigration laws, said that in order to give a question as a woman the necessary, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
Given that most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them, they are in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.
Place of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, they rested on it in the room of the press.
One-room separate cottage, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which it rests with its head on the couch of the press.
Connells' real estate office said that the pig in the photograph is the pet of owners.
“There was a mistake, so it had already been removed,” said the spokesman of the office.
In the real estate information, Connells described a former prayer room as “a single single room house.”
Although the office removed a photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house raised interest in social networks, where some asked whether the press was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey's city has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
Harvey lottery player gets a million.
There's a new millionaire in Perth, one lucky boy, from Saturday's driving a lottery home, will take $1,1 million.
Harvey's trances had been in the process of sharing happiness for the second time in five years, and in November 2009, the last time it was to win one million dollars.
A happy winner but only has to log in.
Steve Forward's shop owner said he's talking about winning the entire town on the southwestern Perth.
It's a major topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split up one prize last month, covering several happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and only a few weeks earlier in Belmont won the incredible 7.5 million dollars.
The winning couple were 20 years old and said that the prize would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionary is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totalling 85 million dollars.
Deutsche Bahn's trains won't be leaving tonight.
Machines want higher wages
GDL marked the protest as a warning strike for which he selected time outside the traffic tip.
The chosen time of strike takes into account many people who return from the weekend to the first working day.
At the same time, we think of people who are in charge of work during the day," said the union on Monday morning in the press release of the strike.
"Our first strike should involve mainly freight transport, less passengers already," added GDL.
DB's official response to the strike announcement has not yet been published.
It is neither clear how protest action will touch international railway links, including the Czech Republic.
The departments require an increase in engine wages by five percent and a reduction of working time by two hours a week.
At present, the average salary of engineers is between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
The DB drivers work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to contribute to wage growth in the shortening of working hours.
They stress that wage evaluation of engineers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel in which the DB is not counting on the working week.
It was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at Barum rallye.
What exactly happened?
It was a flaw in the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have repaired and continued at a slower pace in the service, where the mechanics would trade it?
If we were to head right there, we would.
But there were two more eras waiting for us, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start burning was large.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the wind.
Everything was caused by the car we had been drinking for more than six years to be on some level.
The race has shown us we've done it.
You hit him so you could actually think about winning.
Even the car was prepared by the fact that we really had to win.
Work didn't come in.
On the other hand, the result that we might have thought about has not come up with.
But that's Barumk.
Unfortunately, the technician said no.
You weren't the only one who stepped away from the first-time fight.
They also got out of it foreign favorites Breen, Abbring, and Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites would quit?
Yes.
Especially for the audience it was a shame because the race was over early.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're planning a car, has moved on for a long time at the top.
But he figured out that he was out of the line and he took almost two-minute mannequin.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the degree of winners.
He took the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we got the car right.
He went real fast.
You reported the end of your career exactly a year ago, yet you showed up at the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular event of the rally races?
Not at this point.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't get it.
I've decided to drive her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I guess I'll be on it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have arrived at the track because of you.
Did that please you?
To some extent we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, were constantly asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What are you waiting for after Barumce?
The team continues.
We'll go to Vyškov next week, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Plus, he wants to borrow Honza Sýkora's fabia for this race from us.
With Mira, we have a European dual race in Switzerland and Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you suggest something now?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Korsická rallye belonged to the world championship, you reached your fifth place there in the show.
Doesn't he invite you to try that track again?
She's not crying.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not received a doctor's certificate of incapacity that serves as proof to the organisation that you cannot carry out work duties for health reasons.
You also failed to notify the employer immediately.
The agreement was subsequently concluded that the days will be recorded as a vacation, but the agreement was only orally made.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to allow the employer’s consent to take leave in writing, this procedure has in practice proved itself.
If there is an oral agreement, you have no agreement.
Later on, the alleged consent to the collection of leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence of work may be judged as a long-term unforgivable absence, and therefore the reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment ratio pursuant to § 53 of the Labour Act.
In the event of a court dispute concerning an agreement with the employer, you are so missing evidence.
However, the working relationship with you has not been cancelled pursuant to § 53, you only have the days indicated in the credit sheet as an unforgivated absence.
The unreserved absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to receive material security in unemployment), however, it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend to you again visit the doctor and to confirm in writing that there has been a serious accident as a result of which you have been unable to work (it is not the so-called 'inclusive', it is only a doctor's document).
You can present the document in search of a new job and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity and the rapid notification to the employer or the request for written consent with the collection of leave.
You avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart accident when returning to the track
The track return ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind half of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart second hit the castle after the 172th round broke the right front tire, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought his car to the garage, he didn't tell the reporters and left.
The boss of his team Chad Johnston said the team of cars 14 is disappointed, but he will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do more.
Stewart ran into the first time in the Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which requested repair of the right side of his car.
"We have put hope for a good ending into today's race," Johnston said, and said, "It didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver on a race in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend, and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to race during the investigation of the tragic accident in which the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, which Stewart drove into the race.
The authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it hasn't decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-fold champion waited for a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, in the beginning of the race he developed at 10th and then even at 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, take Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner and hit Stewart, and both cars were sent to the castle.
Stewart went on, but he pulled back to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, will make 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi service facility manager.
For 103 parking stations, about 12.3 million crowns per year.
Donávna picked 150 thousand crowns per year for the same driving places for taxi drivers.
He informed the councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city was using drawrs in the selection of administrators.
The winner then acquired a rental for a flat-rate amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
He is currently deciding the amount of the offer.
"The year after the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of selection procedures, it has proved that the new system of rental is much more beneficial for Prague and more fairly," says the councillor.
The most expensive spot is on Perštýn
The highest prize was offered by interested parties for a post office in Na Perštýn Street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million each year.
About 1.5 million crowns of new administrators paid for places in front of the General House or Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for rents of taxi services were adopted by the councillors in autumn 2012 and in the summer of last year the original lease contracts were published.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and a new administrator found 29 stations.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We let her out every time, making him practically another pond around the cabin.
Then we found Sava there.
An incredible smell!
Our well in the basement has always been enough of beautiful fragrant water.
And it wasn't someone who was professionally made, the grandfather sprained her with his help.
A long time ago.
She was only in three circles and overall unique, like everything at the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she was there for months, she deserved it.
But then we thought the water didn't smell like water.
We were wondering if something fell in there.
In a place where the pump was going, it was possible during a bit of bad luck, there the board didn't go around, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the body was moving.
There was nothing else in the water to see, and we sold it to the bottom.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvized seal around the pump pipe.
We've noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground, there was a sticky package with some cubes.
That's what it looked like.
And a little further away.
Now it looked like a foot-and-mouthed mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the vents are, the heirs' inventions were leftovers!
And it's heavy!
Our store is self-evident, too.
Someone'd say Grandpa simply buried the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The wall and floor are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is undercut.
It's mainly the ships that go there.
And bikes.
And a beach spoon.
The gate with wide spaces was mostly open, as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling, several of the already mentioned vents.
Without the network, it's where the birds are running around, and there's a nest on the walls.
Mouse is useless to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to suffocate, and that's what it was.
But he didn't even help the luft right now.
He smelled the whole store.
So we cleaned out the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around: board, heraklit board, et cetera.
Our house at a distance welcomed the surrounding disinfectant.
We were wondering who might have put those disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here in the village.
It's hard for us to have lunch.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not all right.
If Franta didn't push our disgustingness in the air?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to guard the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just to wash and wash before the tests were done, but it was good.
Taking water from the forest well is nothing I want to do for a long time.
Once we heard the terrible anxiety barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza snooped over her and purged like a madman.
My mom used to tell her 'cause she thought Réza was digging the garbage hose out of the sink.
But suddenly, the hose partially tarred into a club and partially resembling.
There was a planting on the balcony.
Réza got a history of hysteric attack.
We ran down.
She was going to swallow a huge toad, and Réza was defending her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the oil or if she wanted to eat it herself, but it was irrelevant.
When the truck saw the power in the form of our whole family, you probably asked us to eat it when we're hungry, and it elegally slipped into the basement.
We followed her.
It's like a lightning bolt at a well.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her board.
According to the smell, it's a fish.
She wasn't there before yesterday!
Our new safety around the pump was a bit of a espionage.
And we closed the store all day long.
That...
We went out there, and we're all stuck in one airway.
We didn't wait long.
That was a mess over the well.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on her neck appeared.
Then she went to the well, full of land.
She turned around the pump and began to grow up inside.
The disabled employee was grounded, bought at the company's laptops and sold them
A burned employee bought it on a computer company after release and sold it to the company.
The money he earned was spent before he stopped the police.
In a short time, a man purchased in twelve cases a total of 16 computers for over two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking over he went to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Rostislav Brückner.
Motive fraud was the revenge of the employer for release and also the profit of the money.
"When we were interviewed, he said that he used the money to pay the loan," said Brückner.
The police also found that a fraud is a pathological player who repeatedly treated himself on a psychiatric basis.
So money could also have ended up in winning instruments or video-based terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the Commissioner said.
A criminal who's been punished for theft now threatens to stay in prison for up to five years.
So far, the cops haven't told whether they're going to be punishing the bazaars who bought the notebooks and sold them further.
"It is true that they have taken over all new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the base owners have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it, or as I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, the organizers prepared a number of changes to us.
The biggest was the change in the route that brought the target to the flood, instead of leading back to the Yellow Bath.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of Rungo.cz team, and I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand where we took pictures and made videos.
To get my perspective on the other hand, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Kata, just before the start, we had to put ourselves at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who walked past us into the sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on athletes, counting and starting!
The screams of the jasote, but instead of a quick start, the therapy followed the starting line.
After five minutes, we get to the gate, turn on the measurements, and get started at a speed of ten.
We sail with the yellow snake runners who, like Kata, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky adds a view to the Vyšehrad almost to the gycous breath.
The pulsifying mass of the waterfront looks like it's running all over Prague.
In the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light dome on Palacké Square forces many runners to slow down or go to walk.
Just before crossing into the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately after it is followed by the Tower Pavlišt at an incredible pace to the goal.
I hear the admirable breathtaking of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the line, I encourage him, he's going to pry with me, but right before that, my foot and our hands are just passing.
The tour of the Theatre Street gives you a chance to have a short rest and a breath.
There's a lot of room ahead of us where the views of my breath are coming out.
The corner on Manes Bridge shows the Prague in the entire beauty of the sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are carrying me almost by themselves.
The moments of truth are at the first refreshment.
During the crossing of the road, Káťa škbrtná o arches and shows the jump swim.
I'm looking for if she doesn't need help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues with the Goat alley, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, although at this stage of the race it is no longer such avalanche, yet it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I don't know yet that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Following the Prague gate, we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to get down with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata too, because ten cheers with fans are like half the energy sticks.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and while we're down to a lot, now we're going to be driving.
We're running for dozens of runners, having someone particularly tired, trying to cheer him up with a few words, "Come on, just a little bit, you can do it!"
We're no longer running behind the last refreshment, we're speeding up.
We've run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three miles into the target will hurt, but we really need to get wet.
The sun has slowed down and the end day symbolically stops the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turning point, and only the plane to the target.
Speed, which we're running, am I surprised where it's coming from in that girl?
"Come on, let's go under 13 o'clock, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, sprinting, and there's the target.
13 hours and six seconds.
Well, what can we do?
Coach has entered an hour of 20.
So seven minutes below the plan.
Which is a great result.
Closely for the purpose of Kata's feet, I help her to the rails, where she's resting for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well-restrained power.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't give us any thought to the pressure in the passageways to the closet.
Here you can see that the goat alley wasn't the narrowest place.
That's what it's up to here for the charger, which is under the impression of nearly ten thousand runners loaded for cracking.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
Even after a while, I'm losing my head and wondering if these beautiful views and, compared to previous years, the more interesting route was worth what was going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that holding a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people join this, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the whole centre of Prague for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year's change of course showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really uncomfortable surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Baths moved between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random audience were doing it on each foot of the track.
Unfortunately, during a city run through the historical center, it must count on obstacles that cannot be removed but the objective of the mass race in a place that is bordered by the walls and on the other side by the river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say the race ended with a goal, I'm going to evaluate it as a very successful one.
For my purpose, I was a little concerned about the health of the involved, but it ended well.
Write to us in the discussion whether you liked the route and what you're saying about the situation in the target.
Prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service workers throughout Bulgaria participated in a national protest meeting in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstrations reiterated their demand for reintroduction of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
On the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov, there are higher wages.
The moon was symbolically protested against the new working days and demanded a return to the original twenty-four hours shifts.
Although prison overseers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice have met, they have not agreed, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) was informed.
"The operation is still ongoing," said BNR Head of the General Directorate of Prison Services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The members of the Federation of Professional Organisations of Workers at the Ministry of Interior are expected to join the protests of prison services.
Why can't the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them?
Physics usually don't sing bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University, in 1999, they hit black.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laikas to penetrate the violin problems that many theoretical physicists are concerned today - trying to unite two excellent working but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of finding a united physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physical fundamental problem between two key theories (although at this point our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved in such a way that it is worth talking to the laymen.
Greene also advised so much fresh and reassurance that he could not be counted on how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, his "syb" most of the time repaired in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to the fact that his book provided faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant universe provides almost all the essential things that the informed lay with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (although due to the fact that the LHC is finally going to "full gas" and so it is a good time to enter Greene’s unviolent opening door to the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, oddly or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and totally acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something more earthful, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that a hundred-meter garden hose can be drawn from one side of the canyon to the other, and the whole scenery is followed from half-kilometre distance (as in the image and on the following page).
From this distance you easily record long in the horizontal direction of the loaded hose, but if you do not suffer sharpness, the thickness of the hose is hardly known.
Given your long distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will answer one thing: distance of an ant from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we're trying to say is that from a half-inch distance, it looks like a long piece of hose as a one-dimensional object.
He's got a thickness of hose in the real world.
If we increase everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle that opens the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that an an ant may actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional in / opposite the direction of movement of the clock handles", i.e. around the circular diameter of the hose.
You're starting to understand that you have to enter two numbers to determine the position of a little cloud: how far away is from the end of the hose and where it's on the circle opening the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (after Experts will see that this chapter concentrates purely on string disruptive theory.
The non-free aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and fucked.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the encircling hose is short, "swived" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important properties of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly evident, or, on the contrary, small, fucked and much worse observer.
Of course, in the above case, we didn't exactly speculate, that we would be able to reveal the "vine" dimension of the opening thickness of the hose.
It was enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillara - we'd only reveal with great effort.
Kaluza sent an article to Einstein in 1919, expressing a stunning idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
The radical statement by Kaluza explained that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be inserted into a single, united concept structure.
The question of how this Kalusus observation goes together with the obvious fact that we are seeing three dimensions of space right now.
The answer that Kaluza thought quietly between the lines and which he clearly expressed and explained the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls down with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and clumsy dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimension in the direction of the hose, our universe has a large, wide and slightly visible three dimensions, which we realize at every moment.
But analogically with circular garden hose, the universe can have an additional dimension, firmly wrapped in space so small that until now they have been hidden from our most powerful experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of Kalusov's remarkable design, let's stay at the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine, on the hose circuit, we'll draw in black with a relatively thick number of circles.
The appearance of a hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will discover the slender dimension of the world still easier, because we will see the motive from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the second short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four-space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination, let us see the illustrations on Fig.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of space geometry as we expanded the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge magnification of the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (we see them on the fourth level of enlargement), if they're screwed into a sufficiently small space; so we explain that we have not yet directly seen them.
The reader's network shows commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle shows a new, small and slender dimension.
Just as loops of thread in densely woven carpets, even these circles exist at every place of normal dimensions - we only covered them for their opinion only in the crossovers in the square network.
The background of Figure 4 shows the common known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common standards as meters, shown side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the following images we will focus on the small area of the preceding image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see on the first few levels of enlargement.
However, if we follow our path behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new one, into the shape of a circle of slid dimension, similar to the thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, similar to that of a hose of a circular circumference at each point of length.
In the interest of opinion, we ranged only in some, regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 of Kalusov and Klein's idea of a microscopic structure of geometry summarizes the space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
Firstly, the universe has three large, far spreading spatial dimensions (from which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has a great size only one.
More importantly, the difference is that we are talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular dimension is extremely minimal, recognize it - just like the circular circuit of the hose - much harder than seeing the obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it over the power of our most modern tools to enlarge.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as a two-dimensional illustration suggests mistakenly.
Krusný dimension is a new dimension, which exists at each point in three normal wide dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent of the same size as the dimensions of the top-downs, the left-to-right and the front-to-back independent (and the perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficient small ant might move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except for three more normal position in a circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case by one more than we would normally expect.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that if we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, it shows Kalusov and Klein's thinking that this does not exclude the existence of additional vertical dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with only an eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structure of a large billion billion meter.
Smaller dimension can barely be observed.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kalusus' idea with several ideas from the source of quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could be of approximately one Planck's length, which is the size far behind the distinguishing ability of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists call the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kalusova-Klein theory.
Wohning Honza Homola advises how to practice on the electric guitar: 5th part
The whole nature of the "twelves" consists of a twelve-thirty harmonious form, which you can repeat in any way.
Whoever asks for a musical theory will find its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By education a puppet and a puppet conductor whose facebook profile can be followed here, they live as graphics 20 years ago.
She's a guitarist of the band Wohn, which I'm afraid you can't leave.
The guitarist is the father, just like Brother Matěj, the leader of Wohnats.
With training, start on one string.
"The ritual model is up to you, you can think up anything, just apply it to the harmonious model of the 12th," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza, what with the twelve harmony on two strings, and how it's starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can already make some songs with melodies.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for a change of tweaking, he warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonium and try to get her together with the 12th.
Then exercise her honestly.
As best possible, you will be able to read it in an interview with Jane Homola at the first lesson of his school game on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the big fortune, it's not for the castle of Dvořák
We take the point, and we're happy for it.
The first half of the time we, the second home, had a chance," said the attacker, who this time scored from the penitentiary dome.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, were you, like, accompanied by a giant whistle?
I didn't notice it in particular, even though on the second goal where there are domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
You settled the money after half an hour, but you also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept up the beginning, we were passive, there was a corner, and then a penalta after it.
You picked up after her, and the first half of the time you were a better team with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the incased goal we played well until break.
We thought in the cabin that we wanted to keep the game at its pace, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home at the break said something to their game, they probably weren't very happy with her.
On the field of rivals, you've just been stabbed for the first time while maybe you haven't got a goal yet.
Why is it that different?
I don't think it's such a difference, it's more important for us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Plzen, that's another category.
Four games you were waiting for goal, weren't you afraid that after the last game, it could be similar?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet for a big celebration.
Iceland - the bath comes from a mile away crater.
A lion flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull refrigerator, flows through the underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the iceberg, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns scientists the most...
So far, the situation remains immutable.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) continues to fly out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous erupt of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
Scientists, however, worry that the lava tunnel could be opened in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the same intensity as the present era, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá a Fjöllum and on other rivers.
There's a strong smell of sulphur in the area around the erupts, and there's a cloud of steam and gas coming out of the cracks.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption of Fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also much more gas," says vulcanologist Armann Hösculdsson.
However, since yesterday the weather has improved significantly, in the morning hours there were almost windy areas.
The footprints of the sandstorm were washed in the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange degree (second highest) is valid for Bárðarbung and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
Walked through the wings
Airday in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, the Air Acrobat girl Peggy Walentin, who came out of the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing, and also between the wings.
That's where he's sentenced only to muscle strength.
This year, Cheb's flight day took place five years and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only a "cold walk" in the submission of the German acrobats Peggy Valentine's, but also a legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or an aircraft Beechcraft 18.
That's the one who took a look at himself with his shining cover.
The Wingwalking Acrobat called is originating in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to launch.
But due to a large number of deadly injuries, he was banned.
But today it slowly returns to the programme of flight days.
Peggy will climb out of the cockpit after the launch on the upper wing.
That's where he shows all kinds of exercises.
At the end of the performance, he moved to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Ludek Matíček from the Chebské Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E aircraft is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main nail of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter got to the surface with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so called in numbers).
This was the lineup that Air Fans in the Czech Republic could see for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated everyone breathtaking acrobacia with an airplane from 1945.
He was made before the war, but he probably never took part in it.
It was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in the civilian sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at Munich Castle Airport.
In the same place there is also another pearl of chebe air day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Exploeditor.
There wasn't a powerful machine to see at the airport.
His embossed aluminium coating went to a distance.
The machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in French Air Force colours was also enjoyed.
A small transport plane jumped into a secluded Turbolet and a German Hofu brought some of the German delegation to the air day.
German neighbours have demonstrated themselves in Cheb with redesigned aircraft How 18T or three-member formations of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic back before the camera!
The family's worries have changed Lucie Borhy for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator obviously doesn't know anything about it.
It's like she hasn't stopped in two months!
It's only been two weeks since blondes ended on the sixth Sunday in which women experience the greatest stress after birth.
However, Lucie will not be regularly shown in the main news coverage of TV Nova.
Regular return is waiting according to flash information.cz until next month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs more than a TV audience now.
Lucie Borhy's back on TV and it was a hit in black.
Exhibition in Prague for a year?
Hala would sell out, planning to say good-bye to Jagar.
It would be dignified if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union is going to do it," he said in the Jihlava after an exhibition called The Golden Match, in which again the magnificent Nagan team was meeting.
Even players who participated in the golden hatrick.
Players would like it, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would be simply good to say goodbye to the gold generation during the championship.
I think they can find one two days during the tournament where it is completely free and where such a game could be played.
We tell Gum (Jiře Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (the organizer of the jihla struggle) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with New Jersey playoff?
So if I fly in like this...
But you don't want to play in the representation.
Or has the jillah meeting changed your decision somehow?
The representations and exhibition game are two different things and the representations are decisive.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially in the world championship.
There they should ride players who have a name for it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed at all.
How did you even enjoy your naked reunion?
It was just great meeting the players.
You've brought back stories, and you've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
Most important, however, was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey, and that one generation is leaving, and it really was worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Růžička and Petr Chechmánek on the syringe.
You're still gonna have your first team game on your own?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holik and Robert Reichel, we joined one three.
For all of us, it was the first show start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, there's no way to say that.
The park was caught by Dominik Hašek for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jágra for reasons why he decided to end up in the representation).
Even the hlilička did great.
You were training with me one night, and there he was.
And now he's caught fantastic.
First the US and then the Netherlands, the football players start to qualify
A prominent guests were at the hotel's mixed NH on Monday morning.
People could see Peter Čech's goalkeeper from Chelsea, the representative coach Pavel Vrbu...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The replacement of Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at the meeting about half the twelfth among the last ones.
We have a lovely fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't like it?" he said, when he'd come to the press in his team before the press.
Programme of Czech representation
Monday, September 1st: start of the event, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9. September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Russian and spol. can support fans before Wednesday's match against the US (20:15).
The representations for them opened Tuesday's training, which starts at 18:30 at Summer.
And after him will be followed by an autograph, which the Russians and Czechs will not miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
This praises Coach Vrba who was complaining about the number of social events in the spring.
We are finally dealing with what we want to do.
Now we're gonna focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together eight days.
We will have time to practice things that haven't been so long," he praised Vrba, who officially leads the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by the Musketere image during the entry into the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three games under the Vrbou, all preparatory.
With Norskem and Finland, 2:2 and Austria lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's it now.
The competition with the Netherlands will launch qualifications for the European Championship 2016.
It would, of course, help the Czech team if the general would take over against the United States.
The first year was for us to meet.
The results are important now.
We have to think about how successful we are," Vrba agreed.
David Lafata is the only player who has 30 members of health problems.
He's suffering from heat.
If he hadn't recovered from Wednesday's fight against the US, Coach Vrba would have called on one more attacker.
Genetic disorders are often not diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her growing up thinking that she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was about Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK Charitative Organization said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because it knows very little about the disease.
In the United Kingdom, it is believed that CMT suffers from approximately 23 000 people, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motors such as muscle weakness, an inconsistent walk and a broken toes.
Inconsistencies or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is irritable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought that she had Freidreich ataxy (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed she would be pinned on a wheelchair before her 18th birthday, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children now 51 says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I've never been able to ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I've been bullying me at school because of my walking and running."
When Rodgers was 13 and was after several operations to release her tendons and match her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room, and looked into her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information on the illness in the library and wrote to the Association FA," she says.
When they responded to me, I was shocked, I totally panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and before I was 25, I'd be dead, and then I'd gradually lose all my skills.
I was on my own planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not worsened as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, said, “I don’t think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous."
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The CMT UK Charity Organization launched a month of information about CMT to alert this disease.
Enterprises in the area of Washington: tax is being raised at the turn of the economy
Growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of companies in the country with an accelerated recovery of the economy increased slightly last year and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Businessmen in Maryland and Virginia combined for the fiscal year 2013 into state and local treasures were $27.6 billion, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burden - both state and local - fell by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and it was a third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to the study carried out by the professional company Ernest & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows, in proportion, the smallest corporate tax revenue.
The researchers claim that the majority of tax revenues growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which this year's property tax for three consecutive years increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation appears to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, which is an annual increase of 4.2% in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax represents less than five tax companies.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax is almost half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base of D.C., government or non-profit organisations that do not pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to a healing real estate market.
According to data, income from business seems to increase as well.
Companies in this region published a tax on corporate income of $2,3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland picked one billion dollars on corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although they are taking the same direction, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3%, while the growth in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the increase in taxation under average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation) 6 %.
The tax rate of the company in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the US Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was not evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a law that reduces the tax of business companies from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will fall to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the rate of taxation of revenue could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to recent studies, small businessmen in Washington are doing better, which is why they pay higher state and local taxes.
The Živnostian tax for small businesses as personal income tax - the compensation structure of increasing the cost of price increases, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in trade tax will probably continue next year, the total tax revenue on government and local government sales will increase to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be held behind others as the reduction in State expenditure is taxed on the labour market.
What you missed: The head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novoruska and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state rise in Ukraine?
Putin called for action on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government forces with pro-russian rebels have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-rust, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the West by the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is opposed to democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kiev, and thus cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has exercised its right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, has to propose a further confirmation of the anti-russian sanctions within a week, decided on the EU summit tonight.
The newsmen said it to the Permanent Chairman of the meeting of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the shift of sanctions are to be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union Summit as the head of the European Council, the so-called President of the Union, who runs the top meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
Catherine Ashton, the Italian Foreign Secretary Federica Mogherini, is in charge of European diplomacy.
The Vice-President of the future European Commission must still be confirmed by the European Parliament in his role.

Joan Rivers' family: "We keep fingers"
Joan Rivers is unconscious three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today expressed her hope that a 1-year-old comedian will heal.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for rescue service, according to which she had a heart stop at the York Endoscopy in Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of the sedation and under strict supervision until they are sure of its state that remains “serious”.
The reactions have not been long waiting for itself, including the incredible support on the Internet from a personality such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisting title
That the media twist their headlines into reality, there is no news.
I know that the headlines are "selling" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that many so-called "readers" are not reading anything else.
And that's a fact that's been a lot of trouble lately, and the word's more strong.
This includes in particular articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that Israel's "attok" was the reaction to fired missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared truce.
This then appears the title "The Parties have broken the truce".
Does the journalistic community realize that they are directly involved in anti-Semitic positions that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd exclaimed the passwords of "Jewish Pigs" and the like, I lost my mind.
Is this what the world wants to finish with Hitler?
Do our journalists realize the fact that the Jews were destined for the destruction of the Word?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "seeing dogs of democracy".
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend also the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would destroy and the Czech Republic would erase itself from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the state of Israel, nearly 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're good.
If you ask them why they don't go between them, like Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security, and top health care (I have seen myself as being in the top private hospital Hadass, financed by the support gifts of Jews from all over the world, also Arabs usually go and are treated there, of course).
Hamas will also attack their Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real help of Gaza, and this restless area, is to rid her of Hamas and disarm him.
Not to judge Israel, even in the titles.
Inform you of Hamas' practices, about human abuse as human shields.
Please inform that Hamas is intended to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the expense of the death of innocent Arab children.
Tell them Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Tell them that during nine years of self-consumption in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which adds water and electricity, but for which Gaza managers do not pay and even get upset that, at this time, the supply of electricity is interrupted.
Had Hamas not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide attacks in the territory of Israel, but for example in the construction of housing houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live significantly better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the statement of Information from Monday morning: Internet magazine - video manufacturer and hundreds of other things - he buys $1.04 billion of US dollars (970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement caused surprises not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that YouTube was the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Googlu looked certain in one billion, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which only started Justin.tv three years ago, had been installed to become a generally used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - the words Business Insider “YouTube for live transmitted gaming”.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos of "Let's play", a kind where wiserlanti (most older) are giving games of Mystery Science Theatre processing.
The fact is that YouTube, during the description of Twitche, comes into the crossroads a lot, so news that YouTube buys Twitch, no one upset much, was a textbook example of how the established company pays off a possible competition.
The argument is why the YouTube agreement failed, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have now is the expression of CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because we believe in our society, have the same values and long-term vision and want to help us to fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
It's hard to understand what's so wonderful about playing games instead of real playing just watching.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder in the morning, as Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is watching a stranger get 20 hits in the head of Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from the perspective of players, so watching their record without you being able to control the perspective yourself, is a pretty good recipe to get a painkiller.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers of our electronic time will finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone's not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million visits per month and is fourth on top of internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch's snooping into Amazon Instant Video just as elegant as it would be to swallow YouTube.
However, Twitch has something that any company would like to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "They believe in the future of the games" and the media don't seem to be mad, or like, a poaching - audience.
The second basic lie of creacionism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
An original video is attached.
The second basic lie of creacionism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us to ask, "Who will you believe?
God’s Word, or man’s Word?
As if human examination was completely useless compared to the authority they think it has a doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about the gods written by men.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be him who has added another number of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
He seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, flipulate.
And they were people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be God's word.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as described by people, not gods.
The people who were "married" or "inspiring" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictators of the angels, but those texts were not written to anyone other than just mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really were one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire universe.
If a person of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only scripture.
She would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallel or alternatives in any language, because people's authors would not be able to measure such works.
And people wouldn't have to listen to her because she would have been consistent, planted with evidence that is reliable and true, and she would have revealed deep morality and wisdom beyond all human limits.
She would continue to inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we'd expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin and all are constantly falling apart in more and more separate deniminations, seeking contentious truths, and each of them claim God’s guidance in some way, regardless of the continuing extermination and separation in each direction.
Jewish Tóra, Christian gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'llah's Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathhurštrov Avesty, Sikhish Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, Mormon Book, or the Book of Uranti are all considered "Absolute Truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the people of each one of them say that the others are on the market.
The only logical explanation is that on the contrary, they are all to a certain extent.
None of the above books have any advantage compared to others.
None of them have evidence of resistance, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I do not say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apiology, because they contain irregularities, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it is not possible to claim that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many claim that they have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - that each can also contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
First theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contrarys and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it counter-disclosure, more like mutual comments.
We must once again point out that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five of the book "Moses" and Moses do not write the authorship of any of them, because they are almost certainly not as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions of less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were refiltrated at the same time and are all assigned to human authors.
No way is the Bible as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their infinite foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of zooastrianism, Buddhists, Hinduism, helenenicism, druidian cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gentile Faith, followed by the doctrines and ebionites and their completely different insights into Jesus, which eventually combined in some sort of compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, like the lucipherians, were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these repairs refers to the king of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to the young Moses religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to Belzeb "The Lord of the fly".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently amended both for religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened with the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in the series of commission decisions on the snow in Nikaji.
The four gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected by simple lifting of their hands, as if the facts had given up or refused to vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centres.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter at the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon developed this way from the narrowing of the primary church.
So the office simply accepted as an gospel of any relevant story that collided between uneducated meats at that time.
However, more than ten books from the Bible were taken out in the same conscious way, even though they referred to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we will find writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved this way if God was the true author of this wicked michanic by reputation, parable and psalm lyrics?
The Bible has certainly been written by people and certainly not by much light, rather than by the contrary!
That's why so much of her content is historically and technically completely wrong, whether it's almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believe snakes and donkeys can talk, believe in convents, blood offerings, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used the magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him from the glue.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were outcasts and bats are birds and whales are fish and say they're a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cut-off patterns, they would give birth to a pulverized tvata.
How could anyone say that to anyone who knows anything about genetics?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know.
If the Bible were written by some higher beings, it would not contain such mistakes as it contains.
If it came from a pen of a truly superior being and was intended to be literal stories, then it would not contain any of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it is totally failing because, most of the original Hebrew writings, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bongous savages, who ignored or supported cruelty against animals, incessities, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence on children, abortions, plenary, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing God’s will.
But Creacionists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then it must be ignored!
Why?
Because if the Creacionists didn't have their loved books, they wouldn't even have a God.
There's one thing in their world and the other is the same.
It is ironic that they reject God's "piece" as "respecting creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and of the God himself and even insist that their supposed "holy" books somehow throw out God like that.
Not their version of God but all the versions of God.
Creative Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the gods.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship a man made compilation, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are the word of Jehovah.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
All that people have approved or refused to their alleged "changeable words" of any god was invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered, and twisted by only those who were wrong.

Apple iCloud reportedly according to hackers, there were naked images of celebrity in the public
A picture of the screen with the list of missing files
So far an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes both naked and pornographic pictures of American Celebrates, alerting this to the US server Mashable.com.
They are reportedly accessed by unauthorized access to the user accounts on the Appl servers, where the disabled are recorded by automatic backup of images from iPads and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as faked, but has already admitted several of the images in question.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title title of Katniss in the Hungarian Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death-sacrifice trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the downloaded images and videos to enrich them.
The footage reportedly showed an interest in American magazines, according to reports on the server 4chan but wants a hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it's very probably really about the weakness in iCloud security.
On GitHub, two days ago, there was a tool that allowed user accounts to be obtained through gross forces, i.e. automatic repeating attempts to sign up with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to different accounts prior to the publication of this instrument.
The iCloud users should therefore, for preventive reasons, change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The loss of naked images of the Celbrite considered to be a reminder of safe use of online services.
Although there are servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, securely better than computers in households or smaller companies, the upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form of unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up your browser photos online or any other sensitive content, please encrypt the files before upload.
It is also understood to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone to run only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time and especially have space to delete unlisted images, so they will not unnecessaryly occupy space in the online repository.

Smart way to save for college script
Given that the price for a university script for many students exceeds $1 000 per year, the student in the second year came in a smart way to reduce costs.
He devised a book lending system from senior classmates with a nominal compensation offer to delay their sales back.
“A book on calculations that normally cost $180, I won a semester for ten and a chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He's spent 120.
According to the University Council, an average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to handle these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of a textbook, which allows students to use the semester of the book, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 booksellers in campus grounds, says that the book lending has doubled since 2011.
The research in the sector shows that around a quarter of books in the university bookshops were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought according to the National Association of University Shops in University Bookshops.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books can be lower on the Internet by one third than in the university bookshop.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostethler is nearly $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it at Chegg.com in a retail store dedicated to textbooks, purchase a new one for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other people or wear and wear, the appropriate teaching texts are used.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is selling for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, high school student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid for the used copy “Strategic Media Discussions: Understanding The Business End Of The Added Business” 42 cents.
The new one was sold for $48.
University teaching Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, proposes that students at their teachers verify that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold as a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are also a popular alternative to the purchase of used books. eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
Also, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost for a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a 'Calculus' for the whole semester for about $20.
Please refer to the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow a book, including a penalty for notes, highlight or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, a fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide a regular e-book instead of a regular book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows the "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most favorable offers can find the students of literary courses because many classics are now available for free download while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends being managed according to ISBN, because it guarantees you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it's really in storage, councillor Gaul.
He's convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Bahna, it's mud.
And then they found rifles in the well from the end of the war
The well is located near St. George's church.
We discovered the growth around, and we started to pull out the airline -- about a meter and a half a mud and a rotten leaf.
When we approached the morning of the ovary, we ran into the barrel," Radomil Novák said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found out that it's a bag of attack German rifles that used SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were produced at the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wood constructions were broken down over time, which is why it is useless.
Of course, her body is preserved-- it's holding shape.
How did it get in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe the people who needed to get rid of their weapons used by SS units were probably afraid not to move away.
Guess the Fascists on the run wouldn't do it.
They were throwing away weapons in the woods," the founder thinks.
The box was the only thing the fans of the Duha Jeseník movement found in the well.
"They could have been hand grenades, they used to be around a lot, which is why we slowed down the excavation work, carefully snuffed the mud to make some disaster happen, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The finding will end in the museum depository at the castle in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet delivered the captive of Bohemia
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-russian separatists.
Kiev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... I'm called from Donetsk," he apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with News.cz Ukrainian general, Volodymyr Ruban, or also director of the local Center for the liberation of war prisoners.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
In any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban makes clear with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"It will be - go there," he finished one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again dedicated to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in charge, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-governmental protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-russian separatists is dedicated to 40 hours a day.
Currently.cz: Maybe you know that also Czechs fight on the side of the pro-russian separatists.
Our counter-intelligence estimate their numbers to thirty.
But there can be many more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed Serbians, Dagesters, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but not yet Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we ran into your captive countryman and we could set him free.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs to join in the prophetic separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to take them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs fight in Ukrainian volunteers and separatists are engaged, they will shoot them after questioning without mercy, just like any other stranger.
The Separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they believe that they deserve nothing but death.
If, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Danish separatists - and among them, then also Bohemia - then they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's gonna survive.
The Ukrainian party is also acting in a war like a state.
A.cz: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, I'll be in exchange.
Some sources say it's been over 100 men a long time ago.
We've stopped counting long ago how many people we've helped.
But we've just freed them... not saved them from the war if they decide to continue.
The rescues are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's how it is.
And every day, there's more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release the captives and just a human request.
A.cz: It is being heard that in a few months you have gained great authority in the pro-russian separatists and even trust... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both cylinders?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "a crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't insult me.
And maybe it's also the essence of our work.
As Head of the Ukrainian Officer's Choir, I gained some authority earlier.
I never get caught, I don't cheat, and I always keep a word.
Whatever's going on, I'm acting honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is a Ukrainian government, or the Danish or Luhanian government very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're torture and killing them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and... this job could be over at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
The Ukrainians and the separatists are removed during the hearings.
I'm afraid so.
And executions?
They only go away on the potty side.
I don't have information about the Ukrainian military being in charge of the prisoners, too.
Not even the indications that the Ukrainian army is committed to something like this.
We have a lot of executions, but I can't, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the proruu separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent, and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk -- that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irresistible opponents for life and death.
Like we say, they've gone overboard with their throats.
The same dreams and desires were made out by the way in Majdan.
And now I'm going a little special: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other is a small one.
This sentence of mine already has an irreconcilable conflict in it.
A.cz: How, for example, does one of the toughest leaders of the proruu separatists Igor Bezler appear to you?
Every time they cross the line of war, I'm without weapons, and I show soldiers or gunmen broken hands.
And they always have me both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters in a shell or in an optical targeting device.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I always see well... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
An excavation officer, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little genius in a big Russian empire.
In any case, they talk about it all the time, and Ukraine considers it some kind of misunderstanding.
A state like this shouldn't even exist.
At the same time, he is the incorrigible enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you are your Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk called weak, helpless and tired "in charge" who would do the best if he left quickly.
I get at least five times fear behind those three hundred meters of walk.
So why should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that it harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think the share in war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that Ukrainians Jacenuka are called "crack".
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which fear would go, or with other respects and authority.
His behavior is directly copying the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right to cry in Parliament, to ask him to play his intrigues with him, to threaten to post a function... he must drive the country, manage it and protect it at the time of war.
When threatening the country, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest on the spotty emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Janceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's been complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
Reportable 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the US's 90 million budget and Sin City: A woman for whom I would murder only 12 million from the 70 million budget.
Sex Table with Cameron Diaz made $14.6 million during the first weekend, as well as movies for children like how to train dragon 2 were a disappointment for the cinema.
According to the article of Robbie Collin's film critique in Telegraph, children's films are about the guilt of their quality.
Collin referred to the year 2014 as the "lowest" year of children's films, and how to train dragon 2 called "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films mounted on a slightly older target group, it appears that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of films itself.
In July, he compared Entertainment Week's CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between the Day of War and July 20 in 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crops are similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in audience access and greater popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be seen.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's book processing, Hollywood Reporter, said: "I think the times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been done.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash marketers, Netflix has won the profit of $1.2 billion online, which is almost twice as much as 837 million dollars last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized his studies for relying too much on comic books rights, and he foretold a "crupulous" Hollywood.
In light of the current downfall, some commentators declare that there may be something in his catastrophic prison.
With the introduction of possible big cash marketers in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoňů and Jursky world, different numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
A producer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in sales as simply ‘cyclic’. For Hollywood Reporter said: “The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash-sales in history and no one will worry about selling. ”
KLDR again threatens Seoul, set off another short-loop rocket
North Korea set off another short-low rocket to the sea, announced Soul.
A later test of rockets took place shortly after the completion of the United States and South Korea common military maneuvers, which Pjongjang views as preparing for invasion.
Jagang Province is located in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
The spokesperson of South Korea's Defence Department, according to the South Korea Agency, said that the missiles were fired from a place in the northwest of KLDR and flew to a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea apparently set off a missile from the province of Čagang for the first time, said the South Korean media with appeal to the military circle.
The province says there is a underground launch ramp for Scud rockets.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has done in recent weeks.
North Korea has performed an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport to participate in the NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting described as anti-summite.
Stephen Fairlough followed the situation during the weekend and talked to protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenages had to be transported by air from Blue Mountains
DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and transferred to safety after spending the night in Blue Mountain in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheat after Sunday.
When they didn't come home, the relatives called around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search team, including the local police and the rescue team, was sent out and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls in the evening.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell and then hit her head.
The cops stayed overnight, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized condition, they were transferred to Blue Mountain Hospital.
Olomouc only brought a point from Opava, the win was on his leg.
The 23-year-old forvard could have decided, but failed in two of the greatest chances.
Following the goal, a bullet called close to three minutes before the end, but ended up on the Opava goalkeeper Joseph Květón.
I had this on my leg, I have to give it a shot.
I'm mad at myself," he put your little ashes on his head.
"I should have given it up below the lid," he said.
The defense of Sigma did not allow much of it, except Mikul's raid was from 11 minutes, which covered the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they began to push the Hanans, but they didn't let them in the block, and the missiles from far away caught May.
We compared for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But it didn't change your chance, so it ended 0:0," said coach Hanaki Leoš Kalvodu.
Opava the point was taken also because of the absences in the report, where Peter Vavřík was also missing in addition to the pair of wounded, with the three-head shooter Peter Ševčík, who were hosting Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike her former politics, she did not allow them to enter.
The substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma was a footballer, but we didn't let her into any standard," said Coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and fighting.
Remiza is probably deserved, a point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma took the draw to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the Josef Lébra club, which after defeat Znome gave up his million deposit in the cash register with diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys wouldn't fight," he noticed Kalvod and added to the address of the sleeper's shooter: "I know it's coming and when the goal gives him a goal, it's starting to fall there.
But after the first shot, I'm going to direct him to save the goals for the next match," Kalvod laughed.
Al Pacino has doubled over Venice.
The Film Festival is otherwise experiencing the crisis
After a huge enthusiasm for Birdman’s opening film, whose director Alejandro González Inuárrit took part in the event of serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days indicated that the interest in the 71st festival in Venice fell slightly.
Whether the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred or because Birdman followed the criticisms recognised, but less attractive images for the audience as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia for the 60s.
Comic hero
Even the red carpets before the festival palace did not yet wear such crowds as in the past and allegedly no longer was the problem finding a place in the hotel at the last minute.
In Italy, the crisis is more spoken than elsewhere and there is no wonder that it has also affected such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not appear to be a lack of personality, but those present exclusively in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the representatives of comic superhero Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully developed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without any difference, the main event of the legendary actor Ala Pacina became the main event.
Plus, he's in two movies right now.
In the story of a contest that was put aside by Barry Levison, according to Philip Roth's novel, the 4-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: actors on the top of fame who suffers from depression from the end of career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a weird owner of hardware from a rural town in Manglehorn, the film by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's best acting cup shouldn't miss it - but does the artist still need a prize?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and especially the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to come to the ground from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls that were directed by Francesco Munzi became the first shot of Birdman in the long standing.
The Calabria branch of the mafia is viewed by family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director managed to align all assumptions for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and acting.
He also captured the chamber psychothriller Hlad's heart, which filmed Saverio Costazzo with Ora Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroys his own child with a complete anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not meet the warm acceptance or Redemption for glory, nor the 3rd heart, of both works stifling on a traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of heretical leaders.
But after all, two really fine films, that's Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And even though festival pictures have quite a depressive subject, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy listed in Venice outside of the competition and filmed in American cheerleading style for 40 years, has been able to lift the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four producers of pervitin in Prague, took drugs from Poland
"The Detectives have held three men in the last days at 42, 42 and 37 years of age and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug pervitane in Prague from November until this August," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, an intervention unit in Cihlář Street caught a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who served as a buyer in Poland and a dose vendor.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group on the basis of the prior consent of the state's attorney, a seven-year-old man.
On August 20, 20th, 20th, the last of the 14th policemen," described the spokesperson.
For the transfer of drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of activities.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevovo Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitamin, provided various aids and chemicals needed to manufacture it and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrin from the Republic of Poland.
In addition, he weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitamin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drug addicts, 25-year-old, unfeeled female.
For that, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
Criminalists also carried out several home-views on the basis of the order of the judge, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and objects that can be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Dearler has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the facts available, the police found that the main organizer had been subject to a total of seven times as of 1995 for the property criminal activity, the woman has not been punished," added the police spokesperson.
In 2006, the last detained person was convicted of sexual abuse and a seven - year - old auto-mechanist who is under arrest for crime and has been punished nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a criminal offence of illegal production and other handling of hallucinatory and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they have been threatened by a 10-year prison.
In three people, the investigator finally gave a motion to the state representative to make a bond, where the judge finally placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, seven-year-old repeatist, is free.
His position and role in this case were not as essential as any of the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for many "consuming" prices.
In Italy, handmade chess with a record of 42 x 42 cm size is a good example.
If you like, prepare more than CZK 40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43 405.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered by carbon fibers.

The price of this toy is 318 CZK 305.
Moving gymnastics and high school doesn't make any sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that gymnastics have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
Schools in the last 14 days have had great preparations.
Most of the time, it's routine stuff, like transferring the pots from the summer storage back to the classrooms and pushing the wings.
They'll have a little more frmol at the magnesium gym.
A few days before the beginning of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature to the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, four-year-old gymnasium in Horice after three years, opening up and renewing its activities.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetence.
They had to wait for the school to be confirmed by the registration of the schools managed by the MZMT.
“French Socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says French Holland’s key ally
Valls calls on a strongly broken left to show "to show her support" to a combated socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet the consent of the majority of the French.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, "and tossed the applause.
As a consolent gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week despite the passionate estimates of Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed that the rules be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain “sustainable” with the government.
Christian Taubir, the Minister of Justice, but she made him a line through the budget when she showed up at a meeting of rebel socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticized the fact that "France lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative right, with constant internal disputes between socialists laughing when she said she did not expect a new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to build a new government when the previous one didn't last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Penová told her supporters.
She repeated the call of her party to dissolution Parliament and declared that she was convinced that this party might win the early elections and that she was ready to drive the country.
The French governing party suffered in the March municipal elections defeat and in May extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion survey of the Journal du Dimanche weekly, 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party presents a risk that it will split into several competing fractions before the end of Holland’s 2017 term of office.
Pascal Perrineau, political scientist of the University of Science Po, warned that the French will soon be patient if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but the public opinion must think that changes are being made in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art Prague will no longer limit until the elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved until new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague it will not disappear from the municipal choices of another playroom and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no limit on walking dogs.
Prague will not be ready for October’s elections to prepare and approve in the representative of the amendments to the relevant decrees.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not take place in the current city, which ends in a few weeks' mandate," said the councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls such as Prague 5 and 7 decided to cancel gambling in their territory.
Herny won't disappear, the gambling order won't change yet.
It's the task of new city leadership after election.
We would now not technically make it because of, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and so on," Manhart explained.
He added that the recent negotiations of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the Decree, would take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the plosh ban on gambling is prepared on the day of municipal elections of the city of Praha 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called beckoning.
In particular, Prague 1, which has already sent the Magistrate a proposal for a place to expand the current list of prohibited sites.
Musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
The speech governing the walking of dogs is about a few months away, it's not finished yet.
The location of the hereen and the issue of the becking solves city decrees.
It can only be issued or administered by the representative of the capital.
The town halls only have an advisory voice, they can't issue decrees by themselves.
Last week he placed a victory for the donors of Scottish independence at the reach of his hand.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger that this mistake would make the third time she nearly placed on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether they wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, you won't get their respect if you start threatening them.
The Morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to get the currencyers out of the temple than to let them dictate their vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why he repeatedly questioned his opponent, the Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect the "Scotish" will, if the Scottish voters would vote for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
Darling made it go between Scottish civil society and London's financials, and then the grimasa fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling won't support the Scottish voters' mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland’s currency has been neutralised by more or less.
What really motivates Scottish voters is a fairness, working opportunity and defence of state health which have free citizens.
Darling supported London’s bankers in the monetary field and also gave rise to the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health care.
As Salmond said, "he came into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voters know that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to the voters in Scotland, but to the association of the "boss" to the Confederate of the British industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Union campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent house.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could say that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scots are not to jump out and they have to accept what is.

Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holiday, the last week that was no longer around and we were just hanging out and getting married with my grandmother summer, quiet before the storm, quiet in front of the stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
He reads fast arrows, already fallen, taking down the mountain bike around Imperial to the back of Vara, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun starved his back and shoulders, knocked the rays apart.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still still a holiday regime, sleep at half eleven o'clock, it's going to be worse, a few minutes before falling asleep for two hours, then get up at half seven in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most of them don't rain, on the contrary, the summer is rabid in front of school.
To sneak into a glamorous light on a cape and feel like a plastic character in a glass experience, there's that school, the D.A.
It's a zapotish with a deranged pink cover, and in front of it the old-known faces and a few new, the boys pull out, the boobsier.
That's where the bastards are, avoiding them, and it's just as interesting as they're holding together and how they're here early.
And these grown-looking girls who came screaming, they're laughing about something very hysterically right now, and they've probably changed something in their lives over the holidays, while everything's old to me.
And new first-timers, some nervous and other enthusiasm, why do they even come here?
Because it has to be, it's an educational obligation.
So inside, cool humidity floors and light smell of disinfectant, poisoned by a schoolboy with a mop, unfortunately still the same thing that's supposed to lend a student a key to a cane box, where you can leave your textbooks and which are still so little.
For the bottle.
The smell of the wardrobe remains in memory, now it's not done, it's pretty high, but in a week it's gonna be worse.
It's just that the stomach's stuck and the head's starting to hurt.
A head, which is even worse than it is to learn from mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen ones, which I don't belong to, and I will never be.
Again, these threes and fours, don't let fives, hide from testing, fit into the bench, and best exude, be there, not even as a name in the classroom, and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one with no competition, does not humiliate anyone, and does not hit anyone's leg.
It's been ten months for the longest year.
And it's only the day before, now it's like years ago.
She let her daughter die.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without other help, she was born a little girl who, after she was cut off, packed in a prepared blanket, hid under her jacket and carried her to a road cook, where she put her in bushes several dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school
I think it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had the need to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I gave birth there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the rubber cord with scissors I wore into school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The following day, she returned to the place, put the body of the child in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, packed it in a black plastic bag and hid and left under the stairs of her grandmother in Havlíčkov Brod's house," stands in action with the fact that it is not entirely clear when a newborn was killed.
It could be in tens of minutes, but even a few hours after birth, suffocation when covering the blanket or inserting under the jacket, cooling or blizzard.
The same scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman near an undetected period from February to April 12, when a child’s corpse was found by random witnesses under a quail at the pond in Havlíčkorodsk, she secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom, the subspace apartment in the family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting her hair, and she tied the seal, which was surrounded around her neck, put the child in several plastic covers, including plastic bags, and left it in the bathroom.
Then in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
In the end, a friend gave it to a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, but apparently he didn't know about the pregnant partners.
For this reason, he is not in court now, but was only punished for the sin against the funeral law.
He was also the one who turned to the police later.
I don't like being punished as an associate.
He manipulated the baby against my wish.
I know my solution wasn't right, but I felt like a human at the time," she didn't hide the indignation of the defendant who was supposed to be in a man's relationship, and she was afraid of him.
During her statement, a young woman spoke relatively balancedly.
He led the tears into her eyes until the moment she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from which she left her own age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't have the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the judge's question.
But she refused to act with the mind and the intention of killing a newborn.
The other child, according to her claim, was born dead.
But even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn't take hard.
I also reduced smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, it was claimed that she had health problems that it was due to repeated questions.
And that and my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday with statements of judicial experts.
A judgment may already be made on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a penalty rate of up to 18 years in prison, or an exceptional punishment.

Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong are pro-duced by the Chinese authorities on the day following the decision to vote
There was a group of loyal people next door to Beijing, who had a Chinese flag.
The permanent National People’s Congress Committee on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates participate in Hong Kong be elected in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support for the appointment committee, which will probably consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on election tickets and to restore the promise and paradic financial center of Hong Kong's protests to "Central occupation" for pro-democratic activists.
In Hong Kong, the political reform is the main reason for the tension, Chinese leaders fear that the requirement for democratisation will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report setting out Chinese official powers in Hong Kong, democratic activists organised an unofficial referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city business district and occupied it.
The press conference by Prime Minister Li is organized by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun Committee and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei State Council.
Student activists said they would gather this afternoon in front of the Hong Kong government.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the fight with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately began negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of decommissioned areas.
His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of indicating that the Eastern Ukraine areas under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated in order for the Russian speaking region to have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kiev government to act with the pro-russian rebels as equal is consistent with a clear strategy that is governed by the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorusek actual independence to join Russia instead of the West.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April controlled separatists after Moscow on 18 March, the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
Kremlin and separatists recently occupied have referred to the territory as ‘Norvou’ or ‘New Russia’, a term that refers to the famous days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "individence is" everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians have launched civil society in the areas of controlled separatists before the parliamentary election on 26 October, while government forces are attacking civilians.
"In the interests of people living in these areas we must start meaningful negotiations without delay, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's intervention on state sovereignty has been thought in the context of the wider autonomy that Kiev's leadership has been dealing with for several months and which is to ease the concern of the Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted by the Ukrainian government in the eastern area.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The steps taken by the speaker Kremlin, which was intended to correct the “correct interpretation” of Putin’s notes, highlighted the Russian leadership’s approach to addressing the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million population was born to ethnic Russians.
Moscow should be much more difficult to add to Doneck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and the polls of the public opinion that had taken place before the conflict showed broad support for the continuation of Ukraine.
Autonomy, which the Russian diplomats have acted on international forums, would have given the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give Kremlin a real control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, revised five months ago, is the headquarters of the Russian fleet, the maritime commercial base and the historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia and Crimea are also centers down, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his inaugural speech from 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution which would give more control over their finance and language statutes.
This vision of autonomy is very different from the vision of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of armaments and incitement violence.
Putin's final challenge to be treated by separatists as being equal to each other following the further procedure of the rebels last week after the Russian forces and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from an earlier peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The Russian Separatists took over the control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to cover the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has contributed to a huge civilian and military effort to fasten Mariupol, a port with metallurgical suits of 500 000 people, which lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, he joined the European Union leaders’ meeting in Brussels and encouraged an action that would prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecialised escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday to reporters in Kiev, said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovansk after last week two colognes of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military forces penetrated into the Donetsk region to support obese separatists.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ireland during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian deputies captured in Ukraine last week, said Lysenko on Sunday.
In the scandal with exposed photos are included Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his neglect over the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other powerful Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after she got into the internet series of excellent photos of Jennifer Lawrence in the biggest scandal with hacked photographs of celebrity.
Hacker claims he has 60 photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Deledingne, Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle and Kirsten Dunst actresses.
Personal pictures of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourian Greek actress were reported to have been released to the public.
There's 101 celebrity on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for his hand last month, said the Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.
All private correspondence and all private images should stay private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
The Greek woman, now in New York, told the news online, that the hack is “unsty” and those who became its target, “they are reassuring.”
It's thought that the hacker got 30 picture of Palmer with a former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures, on which he's up there unsealing at the pool.
Palmer acted for example in the film Love and honor, where she was her friend Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovsky TV series and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: "It's a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen criticised on his twitter: “The publication of photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods. ”
From a legal point of view, the disclosure of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma football players have made their way, even without winning.
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which co-owner of the Olomousian Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, are, seems, the past.
For the Opavas, they've brought only a point for a defenseless tie.
After all, the club bosses have made a little bit of effort and fighting.
Money for pay could come to the club soon.
"I don't want one more match as I talked about it last week, but I've been far more optimistic," confirmed Lébra that despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, the players convinced him of the improved performance.
The fight and deployment we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive you for not winning.
If we'd played like this since the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost," Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial domestic pressure, then settled the game, and in the second half it was better.
After winning Kalvod's trustees were touching, but they didn't get their options to the goal, so they couldn't win.
Although the result is not our idea.
We lacked only one changing chance in full satisfaction," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in football approaches caused only his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether by my side, by the coach or by the fans," said Lébra.
With pressure, Sigma has to count
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get rid of these things.
I tried not to let it happen," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl cut his head.
He then left a question for Lébro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Wávček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in the Saturday match.
But after all, he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to get on with us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and ride everybody's ass, we can do it," he said.
Warnings have taken to heart
Even Coach Leos Kalvoda did not pretend that the preparation for the match was not the easiest because of the atmosphere that took place in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lébra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about the fact that they didn't want to fight and quench it," he had an Olympic coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to cope with hardness and realized what the other league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
There is no hope that Sigma will work from the start at the next game.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
