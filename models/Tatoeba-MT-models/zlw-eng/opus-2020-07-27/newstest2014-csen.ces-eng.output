Black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money for repairs that break down the highway network, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily fit into the instrument board of your car.
The devices that follow every km that motorist goes, and which transmit this information to the authorities, are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and state planning authorities to restore the obsolete financing system of the American main roads.
Usually, the design of highways has suddenly stimulated intense debate and the creation of various societies.
Libertarians met with environmental groups and were lobbying for the government to use these small lockers that would record the miles you drive and maybe also where you're going – and then this information would be used to set up a tax measure.
Tea party is scared.
The US Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with privacy.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states do not expect anything.
They shall find out how they can move to a system in which the driver pays for a kilometer of road to which they are going.
Thousands of motorists already have black lockers, some of which have GPS tracking, took them to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is not a matter where we can choose power," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Association of State Administrations in Southern California, which is planning to start monitoring the current kilometres for each California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes changes.
It serves this technology.
The point is that the Road Trust Fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at the pumping stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars are driving a lot more miles per gallon.
Federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gas, politicians are losing their taxes by only one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device up to 500 cars to test this pay system for a mile.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles.
It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gases.
California's designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, President of the Committee on Transport, said that he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The producers of the free market from Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for a kilometer.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, the vice president of the strategy in the Reason organization.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative also supports the two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to go towards paying for a kilometer.
The US Senate approved a pilot project for USD 90 million last year, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means to lose many kilometres of work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state to pay for a kilometer tax instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project was completed by Nevada.
The New York project is being examined.
Illinois is attempting to do this in a limited way for freight wagons.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport departments, together with the coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have a proponent.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers have recently been equipped with the device, drivers were concerned about the government being able to follow their movements.
"The Big Brother type monitoring equipment and similar issues were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who manages strategy and operation at the Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the US Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-time tracking equipment.”
There is no need to build a huge, difficult technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand on the daily arrivals and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few countries that are trying to find available technologies that would allow the state to watch how many kilometres the car is going, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be quieter.
Hon brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real driving distance).
This company was initially not involved in an action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging legal liability insurance market where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they were going.
But this device, which is testing, attracts attention to road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using the modem.
“The people will be more willing to do this if you are not following their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there were a number of big mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less accessible ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose GPS devices or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles of all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the public will come to this concept if the device can learn more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so as to be able to pay charges at parking hours in order to provide insurance based on the kilometres and to collect data about the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in this because of the value of the benefits they offer,” says the city’s screening document.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the discussions about paying for a kilometer are not just a big crowd problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Committee on San Francisco Bay Transport say that Congress could have a problem with the bankruptcy of the Road Trust Fund very simply solved by increasing the gas tax.
One-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other vehicles that do not need many fuels, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is sufficient to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
She negotiates Saturday for ČSSD.
Social democracy is mined, people and grandmothers are talking and preparing a common approach.
If the social Democrats get wet within a few weeks, they will sit at the meeting table with perfectly played partners who will put on the table a completed list of requirements including ministerial posts.
Then the ČSSDs either swallow acidic coalition grapes, or they bow down to a drilling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days when he was carried on a wave of sympathy, first hit.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political gremium and mainly force a convicted liar to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only he, the other members of the team will be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the Georgia and now the citizens.
He's not supposed to lie, he's not in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the negotiations of the narrowest management of social democracy.
He added that the First Vice-President didn't lie at the post.
"I will communicate my decision to the UV on 10 November," said Hašek.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdenek Škromach and Head of the Jerona Tejc Chamber of Deputies spoke.
He, of course, pointed out that he was elected two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do everything they could to make the ČSSD 50 member club sound one vote.
He put the crown of Michal Hašek with the sentence: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
They were making another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget in the call for Sobotka's resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team that the August UV held 57 percent of his claim that Bohuslav Sobotka was the candidate for the Prime Minister?
The boss of ČSSD, of course, made a powerful army of enemies for next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood 192 members of this body and the media with all sorts of gossip and figs, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Sobot's political careers.
There will be a powerful washing of dirty laundry, there will be signs of dark alliances between the globaron Zdenek Bakalou and the Saturday wing.
It will discuss the friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the powerful lawyer Radek Pokorný.
There are disputes in the South Moravian and Moravian-Securities organization ČSSD.
Va Compares are the words of the Ostrava Mayor and Sobot's allies to Petra Kajnar: "Chart 77 I signed to prevent the country from controlling idiots."
If the UV met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will put their head in ashes and stay alive.
And then the winning boss of ČSSD ends with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrha.
Martin Doctor on OH issues in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is demanding
His eyes suggest a slight smile, and then he'll take a deep breath, "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Olympics in Sochi 2014 is a little more complex, according to Martin Dr.
We can forget what was on the last Olympics.
"There is nothing working the same way," said the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From an invoice point of view, they are relatively fast, not so much from the point of view of providing information on essential things.
Perhaps we've been suing them for three months to give us how they're officially marked by individual villages, so that we can do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They keep communicating in a series of things.
Is the Olympic village, at least?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Are there any floors ready?
Just the basic concrete, that was the state of the month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a pre-war, there's still gonna be glue.
And if they don't move, what's gonna happen?
President Putin might have picked up an army there?
That's what happens.
Just so it wouldn't be that the Olympic village = the potomkin village.
Rather, they may not be able to make details, for example, to change the road.
Maybe they'll have the way in such a way that we'll have to bring our London games with us.
But I believe they're gonna put it together.
How many Czech athletes could Sochi go?
Now it's about 78, although depending on the nominal criteria, it's changing the number.
Maybe the Krascilers will probably go in the three of them that went out.
No one has to doubt Martina Sáblík's quick-browner, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should go there on January 26th.
What houses will look like in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things on our own by metro, so that we don't just believe in sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a common agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an ecological olympic, he'd have a plan for a giant secret dump.
Fans of winter sports are now taking a meter to the opening of Olympic games in Sochi, others are looking for more and more fears.
The Russian Olympics, which is when they begin in February, are faced with another scandal.
The Russians seem to be unable to fulfill the promise that the preparations and activities of the games will not in the least disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians built very high, Canadian games were written into the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organize the game with "zero waste" has long been taken for his own.
Reporters of the AP Agency discovered a giant dump of building material last week in Achštyr village near Soči.
So the drop full of building material, tires, canisters and insulation foams found in August ecologicals, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities disappeared and the dump disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, the reporters had a look at the dump about the size of three football courses.
It is not the only one in the area of such places that few were created, described the British newspaper The Times.
On site, the Russian Railways, the state monopoly, which builds about 60-meter path between Soči Airport and the sports resort.
One of Vladimir Jakunin's close co-workers led the company that had already swallowed 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways defended that the dump was founded by one of the subcontractors.
Locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achtyr around the village, three months of day and night, trucks of waste material have been driving.
According to experts, the waste is contaminating the local Mzymt river, other streams, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminating the socé water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimajev from the ecological non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal deposits are not the only problem of the Russian Organising Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: Sochi games will cost 51 billion dollars, while summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 came out of 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and that vancouverian nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project retentions, and worry if it will snow enough, there were also reports that human rights are not respected during the work of an exhibition athlete and infrastructure.
Last month one of the workers put his mouth on protests that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers during the game match with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are about to support Russian gays on the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, the new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an award to design a house on a parking lot, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the property itself is somewhat considering.
It was also required that there would be two generations living together in the house, but each of them should have their own clearly separated space.
A younger couple needed an extra office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets, and on a mild land-related area.
That's why the architects decided to place every household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family ties, stories and memories connected to the place."
"Th different features of the house are connected through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy," they explain the designers.
Parents’ home is at the level of gardening with old pine trees, which are linked to family traditions and memories.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognized from outside, because they differ with different final design of the facade.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was produced by boards, part where the office is located, is reflected in whites and remaining elements remained in pure concrete design without further adjustments.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glassy, making the interior of the house very linked to the exterior.
Parent's household, more precisely the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that has great significance for the family.
The interior connection with the exterior underlines the side wall that starts in the garden and continues to enter the living room.
Kitchen space in a young couple's house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then rises on the stairs to his space.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their construction allows for a lot of natural light to fall through the kaskadov.
That's what architects were trying to distinguish from other architects and press something unique.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen parts, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, it only divides a glass wall with a sliding door.

The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo bay.
The office itself in the highest floor is taken in a clean combination of white and black colors.
Stairwell is the dominant element of the house's interior.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance, finds himself in the lobby, then rises on the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, it applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters from students, teachers and the management of secondary and university schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I met with more or less of a success.
Rector Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to give an honorary lecture to the President of the EEA - Zemanovts during the election period, was even requisitioned in the form of an unrequited invitation to celebrate the national festival of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school leaders who have not been so brave and visited Miloš Zeman: High technical teaching in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected member for the ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to refuse to resign from his academic function and in addition to seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, this is not really the same thing as if you were to remain in the position of mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to be a member of the ČSSD movement, who simultaneously wait for the MPs and the captains and, like them, to degrade both professions?
That's why you tell people that they can handle both of these demanding functions with their left back.
I know, there's an example of Michal Haška, who even manages tens of functions at once.
Well, I guess that's not exactly an example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who prefers to leave the Member's post so that she can fully take charge of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation, however, is that you will break the apoliticity of the University of Pardubice by running a function.
The Management of the Paradubic ODS sees your current activity on both posts as an advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help even without being a dean.
I think I have a similar opinion like me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig, they'll have your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters in the next elections are counting.
And that doesn't have to last long.
They don't put bread in Kunovice, they don't put chemistry in it.
More than a thousand tons of sour cabbages want to be produced in the Slovak Fruit Kunovice in the coming months, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
Season started here in October and takes about six months.
Since 1925, this healthy treat has been made in a traditional way by walking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's rarity.
Our workman found a shift of almost ten-mile route.
Each of the ten tanks will fit 15 to 30 tons of cabbage, filling one lasts three shifts," said the director of the race Slovková Fruta David Klabuba.
Grapes are transported directly from their fields to the community by farmers mostly from Ostražska and Břeclavska.
Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the baskets and throws them into the circle.
From there, already sliced green falls into swimming pools with a six-meter depth, where hookers working tirelessly in white clothes and shavings work.
That excites unwanted air.
The last mutilated layer of the green covers the sail and burdens the water.
"The green circle then heals six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidifying substances," stressed the Director of the Klastroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers sleep in salt and cumin.
The sinks after the surprise go to the filling line.
They're packing in a sweet, salty bag or a glass, and they're sterilizing.
Hamé supplies sour greens mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
This interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “collaborate” with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence rat, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to pass evidence to the German Parliament if American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and treated with him for his opportunity to testify in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who handed over the media in Berlin on Friday, states: “Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, the government continues to act as a result of the opposition and is trying to criminalise political expressions by serious accusations which do not give room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the promotion of an international community could convince the United States government to withdraw criminal charges against him.
The charges imposed by the United States Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
The tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the NSA claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel was listening to the phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the Parliament, who runs the Parliamentary Panel, who supervised the intelligence, said that if any opportunity were to question Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without putting in danger and destroying relations with the US,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, published a photo with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his way to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Sträbele said that under the former contractual lawyer of the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had left once.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe" there, said a member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a rough and persistent campaign in connection with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that the reaction of the world to his “a political expression ” has given him courage.
Citizens across the whole and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the detection of an irrefutable system of public service monitoring.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "and the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
We're sorry to kill us, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmérs are fighting.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the reign of the Red Khmer, which was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, life was lost as a result of exhaustion, hunger, sickness, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, i.e. at least a quarter of those stocks.
This commander, the infamous S-21, granted the International Criminal Court for Cambodia in 2010 a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were defending themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the actual extent of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and thus hit it and corrected the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered the Kadars of the Red Khmers to "do people wrong or kill them to deny them food or to commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" to the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the sacrifice, to their families, to all the people of Cambodia," he said.
The five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, AFP said she couldn't accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Only one wants to be released."
"She doesn't care for another," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added that the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than monsters.
Before the court, he was also expected to stand the "minister of Foreign Affairs" regime of the Red Khmer Ieng Sara, which died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, the former Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found an incompetent trial due to dementia.
Leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 in its years for the imposition of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to 100 USD for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in their notification on Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage fee concerns luggage in the upper storage space, so that the small luggage under the seat will remain free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if payers wait until they arrive at the gate.
The spokesperson Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that the $100 fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment forward.
"We wouldn't want to collect this fee," she said.
The airline began to charge first and second luggage in 2008.
The passengers tried to avoid these charges and they went into the trailers hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the sense of this new fee really is not to get more money.
The point is that Frontier's most faithful customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the front gate of Frontier can bring luggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passengers in the front for the same luggage will pay $100.
O'Malley said that the website and the handling procedures will be adapted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee prior to their arrival at the gate.
The new fee of Frontier for hand luggage will not be valid until the summer but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see additional charges for luggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of loss.
Most of them didn't pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost Allegiant Air was followed by its example later.
The only company who also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely follows additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s guarantee fee would amount to USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, was recently flying with Spirit and surprised by what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with the unusual fee of Spirit for hand luggage.
"It was the most recent thing I've ever seen in my air career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance took place in the tower."
The Frontier also uses a sample of Spirit to pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be given free of charge.
In 2008, U.S. Airways briefly tried to introduce drinks charges, but following passengers' complaints seven months later, and no other significant airline did.
The latest move by Frontier to charge hand luggage, if passengers do not buy flights directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to their website.
Air companies pay online to travellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to lead passengers to buy directly from them rather than to do so through online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, went far away in this area.
In September she began to give customers who bought online travel agencies only half a mile within a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut her reward for a 25 percent mile of the trip.
So the trip with Frontier long 1000 miles purchased via the Internet travel agency means the remuneration of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they conduct the purchase directly via Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a reliable customer base in his home town of Denver, but her business is beginning to freeze and lose money.
According to the financial results reported in the company center, the Republic Airways Holdings market fell by 9 percent and the transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
The fall of the NSA’s website does not blame hackers, but “inward error”
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that her website for several hours last week fell due to internal error, not because of hacks attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov pages were not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal mistake that occurred during the regular update," said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by the attack of DDoS (distributed refusal of service) is not true.
Previously this evening, online server sensors reported that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previous NSA spokesperson ABC News said the internal sensitive network of the Agency was not "inconclusive".
A spokesman said that no classified information is compromised.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for deleting NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former state-of-the-art NSA agency, once obtained by No such agency, has, in recent months, become after the tour of foreign and domestic surveillance programmes with the centre of public attention and the target of biting criticism, a product of the removal of classified NSA files from the Agency and their disillusioned by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency has stimulated earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber-optimal operation.
Bombardier's profit fell due to a drop in supply and order
On Thursday, 15 percent of Bombardier's net profit has been reported by the Canadian aircraft producer and trains, which is caused by a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new CSries, nor offered up up-to-date information as regards whether this aircraft will keep its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the launch of the test flight, about a month and a half of the plane flew only three times and there was a question of whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not complete the estimates and shares on the stock exchange in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
The analyst of Cameron Doerksen's state bank reduced the rating on Thursday from the “higher yield” to the“ sector’s performance” with expectations that the storm will be experiencing limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"In the meantime, we've been more expected to deliver smaller aircraft, the profit margin in the transport sector has disappointed us," Doerksen said in the report to our clients.
We believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders as the test programme continues.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we expect the market to increase to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSries aircraft are being launched into the lower area of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was revealed in March and after several months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of CSeries’s binding orders reaches a modest 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the trial flight to verify the company’s claims on low consumption and cost savings of this carrier.
There are currently 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 binding orders when first aircraft was placed on commercial use.
The leaders also provided analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was progressing according to plan.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that testing on the ground and software updates had been scheduled during the plane’s outages.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates, and we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other minors thereafter.
Analysts are still skeptical about the first customer to start running the CSeries flight 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its flight plan and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will probably strengthen our view that putting into operation will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million in the third quarter of the year ending 30 September, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged at nine cents.
The turnover fell marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected the return of 10 cents per share and the turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicated that he delivered 45 aircraft only one year before the quarter of the year.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfilled contracts in the air division were made by September 30, 32,9 billion, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our views, but the low income of orders and the overall market state disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Exports in the air industry decreased by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the proceeds in this division increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion USD.
Uncompensated transport contracts were made at 30 September 32,6 billion, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders indicated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette, decreased during trading on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 percent to $4.53.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10-percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.
The cocaine lawyer who warned the mob against a police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to provide information to the king underworld of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The spy attorney, who informed the drug mob of a major police investigation, was afraid that his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had had a history of being suspected of cocaine use, the boss of the underworld of Neil Scarbrough to transmit sensitive information about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested after the police surveillance of Scarborough, who he represented in previous drug proceedings in 2011 at home.
The cops saw Sarborough (32), as he left at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just at dinner with his colleagues from Law Society, three bags with cocaine.
Based on the trials that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drug.
During the eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were followed at that time by a large investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police stopped heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million during the series of raids, along with GBP 200 000 in cash, in prison with them, another 32 people ended.
Ditta (42) transmitted information to criminals from fear of coming to his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, had experienced a shameful time before the Liverpool crown court when he was found guilty after three weeks of his trial, in two cases, to defend justice.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall happened after Scarborough's police investigation found out he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspect detectives followed him, recorded his arrival at Ditto's house, and saw him place the drugs at 60 percent pure under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home, where he found drugs, and nine interviews were held between the two.
In court, it was said that there were traces of class A drugs in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denied cocaine use, and he said that he spoke with a suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get some credit cards out of it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken away.
In a police interview, he said he was running the office both at his home and at the workplace, and he was visited by clients for work matters.
The Court of First Instance, however, heard that after the key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which had previously represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not violate the law than the legal representative in the criminal area.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his legal representative's position and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went way beyond the ordinary lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation aimed as much as he could to allow them to continue their crime.
Mr. Ditta didn't give his profession a good reputation, but he insulted her.
He was too close to certain his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and I would like to pass information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself when he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of the groups of organised crime that gave him the task of collecting valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must stick to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the coat of his profession.
The unit for serious and organized crime in Lancashire has led against Mr Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also sentenced to three cases of cocaine possession and now to prevent justice, which will demonstrate our commitment to bring the criminal to trial.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of reach the law.
We'll find you and build you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association for supply of heroin, cocaine and hemp.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trading were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug violations.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the block of death in America, as a guest for dinner, would like Mohammed Ali, and as an motivation for his work, he would have made a difference.
He discussed the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of John Kasala have sent against Babylon.
In the elections of 14 Members, the people won only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of ANO.
They come to the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outline of possible coalitions, Jan Kasala, a man who took the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats neither Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably remind us of the first negotiations in 1992, when ODS was also a whole new party.
"The experience was minimal at that time," says Kasal, how this year's talks will be developed.
Kenya’s press demolished by controversial media law
“It’s a scary report, and it’s in place to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply passing out the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” says the newspaper considering the law’s proposal as anti-avoidable.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the CapitalFM Group, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media procedure “will always be ahead because it is an extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members,” he said.
According to Star's paper, the law actually transmits to the government "full control of the media" and Standard's newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "to break a hard blow" and criticise the bill as "serious".
Approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately following the September attack of the Islamic shooter in the Westgate shopping centre.
An act by the authorities of Kenya media turned to each other when she was sending security footage to which soldiers reportedly robbed a luxury goods store on the scene of the attack.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a media officer questionable, but the call was later withdrawn after the media pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Danish shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of “decommissioning” or being denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to eliminate most radio stations. ”
It is also noted that these measures can have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenya’s “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote the journalist Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described Kenya media as the key source of the mutual control and balance system in public life.
“If we leave it on the police, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
The legislators in Kenya have been a target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of cuts imposed by the national wage agency and for the renewal of their fat wages of around 532 000 of the monthly shillings, which are so lined up to the highest in the world.
They must succeed, they know young Bohemia.
Most of them have no interest in any of them.
Still more Czechs take the money aside.
Yet, they do not reach the champions in the region’s savings.
Most of the money is spent on Rakusians, who will save on average EUR 181 a month.
A little more than the Czechs are savings and people in Slovakia.
This comes from a survey of the Erste Savings Barometer Group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is improving, and two thirds of the asked are planning to put themselves aside more money.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of a ranking of promoters, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every other Srb sleeps "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of those who will buy a month higher amounts has increased.
This year, every month, thousands of to 2.5 thousand crowns of respondents were held each month, and this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly entry in the year-on-year comparison but slightly decreased to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit between savings products is pension insurance.
This favors 54 percent of Bohemia, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the other hand, the promise of construction savings decreased, and the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year's.
You only use 16 percent of the respondents, and last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to die, most of them do not know the yields on each product.
Especially young people under 30 don't know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the oldest group of surveyed money has the best awareness of the profitability of the money they spent has, amongst people over 50 years, 73 percent of those asked.
In the international comparison of Erste Čech Group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They're followed by the Slovaks and the Rakusians with a 12 percent distance.
The UN celebrates new targets for fighting poverty
The United Nations starts working without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began at Riu de Janeiro overnight, the Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the "sustainable development objectives" to replace the MDGs which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General, Mr Ki-mun, said last night at the summit that it is now time to "beware of national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process, which is intended to establish a general goal of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Programme.
I will make every effort to complete the mandate granted to me by the Member States and to make our vision of the goals of sustainable development, which will lead to the success of the MDG.
The concerns about the safety of Mosambik are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samara Machely, the mesammbist president of the founder, thousands of people were gathered in the centre of Maputa to call peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she replaced business clothes with a T-shirt decorated with the words "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Square of independence in the capital.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the party to Renamo came about one of the worst fights from a peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an unfamiliar rebel movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodes and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa in an attempt to destabilise the independent government of that country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, the opposition became a party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that there should be an open conflict in the country, but recent events have been recommended by foreign investors and locals.
There is a fast growing economy at stake because the discovery of extensive coastal oil reserves and coal bearings in the north-west can bring companies like Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko, investments worth over 50 billion dollars.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have blamed each other for the tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has created recent conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional party of Renamo.
The violent attack of the former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked the base of the party Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said to the Financial Times spokesman of the party Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing Renamo of launching conflicts because they were attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Guebus was trying to ease the fears of instability.
Mr Guebuzola, for the French press office AFP on Wednesday, said that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “serious ” who wanted to use “anything left of his power to try to prove to the government that he can make his own decisions.”
Both Frelima and Renamo say they want to avoid the war.
However, fears increased when the words of Mr. Mazanga were quoted that the party of Renamo did not depart from the 1992 peace agreement.
He said that he thought Frelimo's party no longer respected the deal.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous conversations between these parties have made to ease tension between these parties, wetted by a series of fights this year, few.
He is a charm amongst two great personalities (Guebus and Dhlakama), he told the speaker at the Open University and expert in Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good bargainer and neither one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which has sought electoral changes, has already expressed its view that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort of a relentless movement to obtain benefits from the government and financial benefits.
Renamo’s election share has been reduced since 1992, while the newer party, Mosambik’s Democratic Movement (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo Party, as expected to improve its position in elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guevova, which next year ends the second term of office – wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"The democratic system of more than one party does not want transparent elections, because it does not want to let go of the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It's unclear what possibilities the Renamo party has, but he has done a turbulent terrorist attack on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most threats occurred in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres away from Maputo's capital, but where Beira is the port on which mining companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are exported coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for about a week when the party Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “war the international community that the situation in Mosamba is not good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent flooding.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country bears sole government and the President, and that he is supposed to be the one to find a solution to the problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the road,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life", says the author.
The stories of Thóra may show that “the gross power cannot be equal to the clever instinuity,” while the artusian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “for teaching at school be too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene” said Crossley-Holland, who wishes to make a careful choice of works of the right age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been guessing this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are in an exciting story with the “prime” message for children as a“ switch”.
Crossley-Holland, who from England translated epos Beowulf and who also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national stories, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is that there is a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subsidious; revealed through a story, not openly appointed.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
The Brno Starry takes visitors to space in a new digitarian
It's clear at first sight that the large planetary hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can go into new comfortable seats, and above their heads the projection area has been reached with an average of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To be perfect, other smaller projectors are to be broken down after the O.R.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"There are 20 computers that generate the painting," said the director of the Brno Starry Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not cover, but gives a comprehensive impression.
"The power of computers is 30 times to 40 times higher than in classical personal computers," said the technicians from Tomáš Gladík.
Digitalium can charm the extremely realistic and plastic model of night skys, human body or ocean bottom.
The audiences will be lavish in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar device is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The starry management plan is to project purchased programmes as well as its own creation in the O.R.
Since Saturday, there are two shows on the program.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it people will learn about space training, go into space, turn into centrifuge, and then see how challenging conditions the astronauts are facing in space.
The second show is for children and has the name of the Magic cliff - Kaluoka'hin.
It tells the story of a cliff whose varied inhabitants lived with peaceful life until an explosion of nearby volcano.
The whole digitium was worth about 50 million crowns, which mostly paid by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the starry from its budget contributed to the small amounts.
The projection area cost 10 million crowns, projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the starry passed two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, by the end of the year, 25 to 30 thousand visitors might come.
We've studied 11 INZERÁTS!
We know where they want you to work!
Last November, the analysis caught over 11 thousand ads offering a job, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62%) on the Internet.
The internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), approximately 60 percent stood.
The failure of job opportunities in itself according to analysis reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example may be a simple comparison between the number of published ads during the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
In 2007, for example, almost 25 900 ads were published in the same period, and in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of job positions on the Internet is oriented towards a much closer, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions, including the workings, stated Pavlín's analysis.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, leading advertising sites were captured looking for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small-scale managers was on the Internet only.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, and, on the contrary, the large representation is mainly a service and work profession.
Of course, the most frequently presented requirements that employers express through advertising offers include education.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the demand for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of employers' ads required an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
In 40 percent of ads (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads.
Practice requirements are linked to qualified professions.
This is in particular the production manager and other executives.
For working professions, these are mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employees shall also, in the middle of their advertisements, indicate the requirements for the characteristics and skills of any tenderers.
In the first place, communication skills are already emerging in the most often required skills.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of New Yorker's New Yorker Comedy Festival
It could be said that the city of New York is a place where solo comics were born in America: almost a hundred years ago the organist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the people who were gathered with jokes by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recent through the New York comedy festival.
The festival founded and controlled by Caroline Hirsch, founder of solo comedy institutions Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too big to play in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes Wanda Sykes' performances, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (becoming heroes), the annual comedy beneficial show at Madison Square Garden, where besides Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
As this festival spread, the world of comedy spread.
Several comedians participating in this festival came from unconventional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll's got out with his sietch (the great leg “League” for a fantastic-photbal theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at the Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday night live program and the "Parks and Recretion", but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoots on" (Mustle Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly discernable voices (surrectionally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a toxic, racially focused W. Kamau Bell) are the product of a decentralised American comedy world.
One of the biggest tows of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy story.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show called “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting is held at the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in comedy DNA all over Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, he would walk through the alley between the two buildings and say, " man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'd live here.
The oil price continued to fall to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, as the high stock concerns exported a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese manufacturing sector in power.
During the late morning, the US oil indicator dropped in European electronic trade in New York’s 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, 39 cents fell, and October ended by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil supplies in the last few weeks burdened the price.
The Ministry of Energy said that America's stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two Chinese production reports led to greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery after growth, which, after the previous two weak decades, has increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, could continue to strengthen.
Ropa Brent, an international oil indicator also used by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents on $ 108.58 per barrel.
No way, Mr. Hash.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that we don't.
There is a need to exert such pressure on Martin Hašek to be disarmed in all political functions and to leave the Member's mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so disappearing.
Martin Hašek is surprised by the promise he has given, but everyone and politics must especially be aware of the consequences of this promise and very considering what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babiš has a material one, but it is a question whether it is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, he's not sorry, he's moving away.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you did not just lie, here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and carries his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you'll be seen as a non-avoidable weakness, whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, be a missing person or a life jacket.
It may seem to you that he's unfair when I only address you, but you're the leader, and they're just the wrong sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to get your ears down for a while, regroup your powers, sit down that shame and then attack again, but that's how the guerrillas behave or the extortions are.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, alpha male, so act like that.
Take responsibility and leave the politics.
The Court of First Instance blocked the regulations concerning the detention and search procedure for police officers in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes in the program to stop and search for persons in the police department in New York, and the judge called off the case.
The second US federal appeals court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision on the appeal that the city had given.
The judge in August decided that the city had infringed the Constitution by carrying out its program of stopping and questioning people.
The town of her conclusions and its amending regulation came up, including a decision to assign supervision to the police department, to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments required for the appeal.
The Court of Appeal has said that the judge must be revoked from the case because she has entered into a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that, as a judge, she did not act as a judge, according to the requirement to avoid the appearance of subsidies, in part due to a series of interviews with the media and public statement, which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge has decided that police officials have infringed tens of thousands of people's civil rights when they were wrong to focus on black people and Hispanics in their programme of stopping and searching people.
It has provided independent supervision to monitor the main changes including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and to arrange for the launch of a pilot programme to test the body-led cameras in certain areas where the most frequent stopping takes place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of the people whose cases were rejected after the police investigation.
The oral justification for the appeal of the city is ever scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there has been stopping and searching people for about a number of decades, but the tours recorded under the management of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have been dramatically increasing to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases they were black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were among minorities, had filed an action brought about by a group action case.
The supporters of the change to the police department’s arrest and search programme claim that changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department and may affect how other police departments use these procedures.
The Oponents claim that the changes will reduce police morals, but not crime, and that money is being wasted, but they will not solve a larger problem when the police congregation is under pressure after the last decade of the fall of its number by several thousand people.
The judge noted that she did not end up in the field of detention and search for persons who are constitutional but reformed the way in which police visits in NY introduced them.
Fivein shopping centers face low attendance
This results from the data from the real estate advisory companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague, Bohních opens up to the public shopping center Krakow, will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
In the Czech Republic, there are now 90 large shopping centers.
Inconsistent performance concerns about 20 percent of mid-sized and large-centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large center for locality and bad markets, which is too much painter or complicated and inconspicuous arrangement of passages, or a dead center," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five commercial centers face low attendance.
The main reasons include, inter alia, poor transport accessibility, low income categories of local residents or market precision at the place.
Some projects were opened almost fully occupied, but their results were primarily restless.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like changing their shopping habits.
The new business center must try harder to attract its customers on a new brand on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The availability of shopping centers according to Sotak is generally stable, even with some centers rising because the tenants were willing to take off rent and hire certain units in the crisis.
"But it is true that recently some projects have opened up, which are not fully occupied and the average occupation is reduced (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)" added Soták.
Trade centres opened in the last two years are pro-marketed according to Sylvia Samadi very slowly.
A place on the market for new projects, however, exists.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for building a project that serves the people of Prague 6.
On the market there is certainly space for the construction of smaller local projects, called 'convinence centres', focused on the purchase and service of daily needs for the population living in the immediate surroundings," said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both small 'service' centres and large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.
"Mies like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees the space for the prepared business center in the winning square, and according to him he sees clear potential of Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí.
"Intensively, the expansion of retail parks is developing, enabling businessmen to cover and expand to smaller cities with favourable rent and operating costs, the area is also in some locations for smaller local or local shopping centres, and their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of Prior houses which benefit from a good location," she added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross rental areas.
The quarter of all these shopping centres is located in Prague.
Between the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, results from Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is under the EU average, compared to those of Britain and France is worth about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check his tip
A former newspaper editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of "buying on the phone, tracking and confronting" to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship to which the Minister of Interior Charles Clarke was to be involved.
Deputy Andrew Edis in the trial Old Bailey said that News of the World caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special counseling” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but in court, it sounded like Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
“The National Attorney suggests that Mr Coulson, now editor NotW, is not a person who stands outside and hopes to catch people outside, but a person who likes to push stories to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: breaking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in a third method.
Obviously he knows about the other one, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does she know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The love couple that Clarke is involved in for the first time were captured by the NotW News Report Department, when the sources he sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, this is with Charles."
The recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projekty".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weather were watching Mrs Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005 in which he said: “I have received a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and which Charles and I would love to talk about.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as for other important personalities, including former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
In Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he himself saw himself with the defendant Rebek Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied the association with other persons for the purpose of getting on their phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to getting on the phone.
The NSA's detection increases the social paranoia of monitoring by the State
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German home intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American Oversight Watch, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbanks.
The German media claims that BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action launched an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' business secrets for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from co-workers, began to expose his valuable collection of surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether to believe the words of the Director.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency carried out spying in the Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with which American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved a general paranoia on state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came up with the discovery that Angela Merkel's cell phone was perhaps bugged for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly potential targets as well as leading entrepreneurs.
Snow highlighted the intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I'd say it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"The German must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now presents the same great risk as China.
However, in all the documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence so far that the United States has passed commercial secrets to foreign companies by their own company.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks some IT and Internet skills and said that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about that.
The German Parliament is called on to say that we should make German Google.
I just can close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is touched, from coal to car and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
The scope and technical development of US spy agencies exposed to Snowden for some companies who have so far believed that China is, however, shocking.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have widely realized that the data stored in the US fall under the jurisdiction and therefore are potentially countervailable.
According to a survey carried out by Cloud Security Alliance about 10 percent of non-American members after the US Prism release for data mining, plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who hasn’t been here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always been happening.
"This is a fundamental theme for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do espionage on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not wish to brag about the countermeasures they have made so that they do not give an advantage to the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has been recalled for a long time that taking a free USB memory disk at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unclear.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of Audi Car Board, says for many years it is common practice to collect before meeting the Board of Mobile Phones so that it is not possible to use them as listening devices.
BfV’s German office advises the executives to consider whether not to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign journeys because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
The prepaid mobile phones shall then be discarded.
However, there is fear that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be against hackerism and monitoring vulnerable.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“The small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized approach,” warns BfV in its report.
The US warns its own company against economic spies from other countries.
According to Washington, U.S. documents of the National Intelligence Estima were presented in February by France next to Russia and Israel, secondly, perpetrators who are involved in hacking activities for economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
A member of the German risk-free company has concluded that in terms of economic espionage, “the worst are the French.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “The servants know very well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe that he was murdered
Parents of an underage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a wet combat spirit at his high school gym, believed that their son was murdered, told the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the town of Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a spiritually balanced tribunes at the high school he went to.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowdes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but that's not what the family of 17-year-olds refuses to do.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” said FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They believe that this contradicts logic, physical laws, as well as common sense,” Crump said.
They think he's supposed to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to their body bags," he said.
The D.A. Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions were left unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a consequence of a crime?
Moore said it was a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll watch the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for the current investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of the "pulse suffocation".
But according to Moore, another cause of death has been reported.
“There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, enough evidence to warrant a criminal offence or a violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and its execution.
The deputy sheriff's office from Lowndes County was not available immediately on Thursday for any comment.
The judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to have all the surveillance videos available that the investigators have examined.
Young parents hope that the video footage will contain a trace leading to the discovery of their son's death.
CDC centre issued a directive on allergy in children for schools
At the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a set of directives has been published to help in the case of children's allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age who suffer from allergy to food is rising.
One of 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directive contains information for schools about how the teachers’ congregation and staff should be aware of children’s allergies to food and how they react if they occur.
Schools are also recommended to have adrenaline available – the most commonly used automatically injector of EpiPen – to be able to respond to potentially dangerous hypersensitivity to life.
State law enforcement authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also lists the typical symptoms that appear in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child can say, "It's like someone's fucking in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "I know my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “unidentified sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise third sex in children born with unequivocal sexual systems.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned only to male or female sex.
The new law from parents does not require any sex to be mentioned for such children, and allows them to mention sex as “unidentified” or “non-specific” on their birth lists.
The purpose of the law is to stop pushing on parents to make their child's decision to carry out an operation for the purpose of determining sex and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersexual person, according to the BBC, after many years, said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'll be left with a fissure set up by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the group about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, a covert term for those who have atypical chromososomes, sex glands (war or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not quite understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine them instead of waiting and monitoring the child's psychological and physical development until the operation is carried out, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, specializing in gender problems, said that the new German law “is looking like a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
Sex detection can be performed without surgery and then can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of a child’s sexuality is not very accurate.
No one can answer why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as distinct from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as either one of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomals and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the field of work, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark in official documents male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “violent” person in June when she won a judicial appeal to keep her status as “unidential” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports will be in addition to M (man) and F (woman) and the third marking, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, reports on France 24 are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition for the removal of "sex theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also defined against the German law and wrote: “With the world being drawn to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning on two other pillars of civilization.”
One new mother from Maryland also said to Baby zone that she would prefer to see for the children to share their sex at birth.
“Security itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she expressed herself to the website on parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, both male and female children called hermaphrodite, according to the handsome Greek, who had two sexes.
And for about ten years, the medical community thought that sex was something like a taboo that could be erased and converted.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexual jurisdiction is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
A persistent theory about how to treat children with unequivocal sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is a pious one.
He created a new concept of "principal jurisdiction" and argued that social causes and influences of the environment – as parents raised their child – were active in paediatric genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theory became disputed.
To the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged due to the wrong circumcision, he recommended that their children be completely castrated, removed even his testicles and raised as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but it was different,” said Drescher.
When the boy was 15, he got himself re-operated on a boy and married a woman.
In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors use this model today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "inconsistencies with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromososomes, but an unequivocal sexual setting.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that, as a man, he could never live “a restable life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed by external organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
At 12 years, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent to plastic vagina.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing sufficient amount of testosterone to properly develop its sexual system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to the man, took the doses of testosterone and had the breast removed,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalise the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Legal Group for informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law “serves and Stigmats”.
“A number of activists are concerned that the German law will achieve that they will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose “indeterminate” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage an intervention.
We believe it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally knows, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because “he allows adults to choose to be included in third sex”.
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that shouldn't be seduced by a child at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, the chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder, and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "divided powers" both to parents and to children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called insensitive syndrome on androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, they evolved in Katie's female features.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a womb or ovaries.
She is now married to a 29-year-old Katie, and she works as an intern in children's psychiatric studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or substitute motherhood.
“The Law gives parents some space to avoid rushing their decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and to think about it, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
In this regard everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing child and you enjoy it.
You don't have to rush operations that are irreversible.
"It brings the possibility to include both children and children in the decision making and the anxiety that parents associate because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex is more identified – and that is a great thing.
It gives the children the power to make their own decisions.
The monkey swallowed the entire house with gas: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
The tension was increasing, the fear was coming.
A man began to threaten to set fire on the entire house.
All the police patrols in the area, as well as the Mladá Boleslav fire force, and the unit of the voluntary firemen were on the scene.
There was also a police negotiating officer who tried to excuse his irrational behavior.
A man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So the intervention unit must have infiltrated the house, which damaged the men and reached out.
The aggressor then ended up being tested at a young-oboleslav hospital where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
In the end, the firehouses flooded with a gas station with a sorbent, which they settled later.
Moreover, all pets were also saved from the house.
A man didn't go to a cop, so a squad went to see him.
Message: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden as Hillary Clinton
The closest adviser to President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton for the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the unexpected campaign book 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Doable down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times magazine received a copy of the incoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the President’s top co-workers organized intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the abolition of Biden would help bring Obama’s pale hope of re-electance.
According to the national-policy author for Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely the former White Office of Bill Daley's office, to measure what effect the former Foreign Minister Clinton should have on moving to the post of vice president.
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within Chicago's campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few presidents nearest advisers – including Daley, former head of Obama's Jim Messina campaign and former chief advisers at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Dable down” claims that Dalea was a representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “Obom’s chances would not significantly increase”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, she confirmed that the administration had really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
“I studied a number of things intensely, and this was one of them,” he said for Dalea’s letter.
You must not forget that at that time, the president had terrible prospects, so we thought, "Kristepan, what should we do?"
While Daley was characterized by research as a “a matter of care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-elected campaign had invested a minor investment to find out whether this move in elections would be paid.
"In the campaign, such money is not spent on election and qualitative research, unless something really is serious," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team considered this exchange.
Martin said to CNN that Daley was asking if his boss knew about this potential combination of cards.
While Daley said that he did not think that the President thought that he was aware of potential changes, the former Head of the Office admitted that he was “possibly” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Dable down” definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the extortion research of the Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a light-lighting palm.
He came up with an idea when he read a professional treatise about jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes world-classification.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer language – increases the pH in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream shines when he reacts with the heat of your mouth, and that's why the more you watch, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lick me I'm delicious," says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're in the beginning, so for 200 GBP you'll get about 2 g of this substance."
The white woman we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up, your protein increases pH and ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing her over the last few months and it seems like a great idea for Halloween's celebration because it's caused by this fantastic bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the medfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
So every copy costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unusual taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the light cream caused by ice crystals that make ice cream, but I'm counting on that we find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
With my sister, we could eat candy, stay up long and show ourselves to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a sketch.
For two years in my apartment, candy didn't show up, and this year probably won't be different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the state retail federation (NRF) this year, the majority of Americans will celebrate Halloween – in fact 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, $2.9 billion is expected to be worth 1.2 billion to costumes.
This year, fashion is the last shot of sexy dead objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can also be like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as man is concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet the men of Daft Punk will reach our channels this year in Instagram.
According to Google, zombie, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year, we put our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my look.
In fact, Americans according to NRF spend $330 million this year on animal lovers costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
This is about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is an amazing report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the U.S. Department of Trade, are about to go over our neighborhood.
In fact, we will buy during Halloween, and believe not to trust, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet according to the National Sugar Association around Halloween, they sell almost 16 thousand tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never listened to.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the wall," "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock" (The House of Shock).
In fact, there are 1,200 scary houses officially dedicated in the United States, which, according to the American Scary Houses, profit from 500 million dollars, and this includes the amazing pictures on which you are quenching fears and which your friend will give on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person who likes to take a look at them and writes a comment as “hesy face”.
And finally, something little about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and cutting the pumpkin archery is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of the baby in the pumpkin began only last year's Pinterest application, so most of us grew up cutting the bars instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. U. population census, Americans spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins.
A pumpkin suit with a slender flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where a 245 thousand tons of pumpkin grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
Reported series of Land Rovers racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as communication devices.
The choice is improved brakes, service package ensuring access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the races coming to Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an excellent way to world class races.
We are glad that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that they will prepare competitions for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of Defender Challenge's car – it will be a really exciting competition.
In February, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day and also the opportunity to compete in desert races in the north of Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have an early election.
President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early elections.
The week after the last interview for News.cz said that there is no other exit, and every government was raised from the vote last Friday, and Saturday is an impossible blindman.
"This can't last long," Karel Schwarzenberg said, "the term of life of the beginning term is estimated in two years.
Next time, the voters are barely going to choose completely differently, they disagree, "I think it's going to be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters as this year in the next elections (by approximately 300 000 votes came before 2010.
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be lost.
The turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, following the secret Irish meeting of the party, declared that he would remain in the direction of social democracy, or Michal Hašek, commented on Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party, as little boys, are going to the head of the state, to allow them to turn on the side."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I've never seen anything so unexpectedly done in my life," said President TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (which he encountered in the fight for the presidential function) suffered: "The head of the state is clear: He wants to take on the party."
The first laws have already been presented by TOP 09.
What was the biggest election surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Far Register of Contracts, which had discussed the House's committees before the elections but had fallen under the table with early elections.
President TOP 09 in an interview for News.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, the TOP 09 seems to want to put forward similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO Martin Komárek movement accused TOP 09 in the electoral struggle that the idea of introducing a register of contracts "cut out" of the ANO movement program.
TOP 09 has now used the head start - she simply paved the proposal that had already been followed into the second House reading.
Fire squads have come to save a lost puppy who's been stuck 15 meters above the ground for a dangerous eczema in a stone
The duck Spanish Ruby ran away from a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who was trapped in a stone saw him walk out the dog.
Firemans sledged on a rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
It was banished by fire troops who came to free it after somehow stuck themselves in a dangerous eviction in a stone of 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old Spanish Ruby escaped from a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and three days himself lived until he was released from a stone on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (24) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappi stone at Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, he was looking for his lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, a meticulous doggyman of stuck Ruby saw an eviction in a rockstone 15 meters above the ground.
The technical rescue team from the Clelkeaton fire station was in place and ate down to free Ruby, using it to pick up the animal transport bag on the rock.
Chief of Technical Emergency Team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move a blubber while he was rescue – he was totally frozen.
He's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's incredible that someone saw a dog.
Peter Lau's technical rescue team expert said: “The Ruby was very lucky during his escape. ”
There was a chance he would be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet to check-in, and, besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was worried when I looked at the rescue operation."
Above all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firemen have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, all of us were just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there.”
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During the interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" of 2004 singing accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he went after her.
And she added: “That was a long time ago, and now she is very kind to me. ”
In a statement from Thursday, Jagger’s (70) representative said that categorically he refuses that he would ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's mixed up with someone else."
Perry was one of the visiting singers (song singers) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted first this week.
George Kervan: Split Europe gives the Scots choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's shaft.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – it did not translate into the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend much time by adapting their official laws to them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continued non-compliance for Brussels would be a cheap deduction for anything the Scottish really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that he became an excavation. The Novinar duck that "independence means passport control", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, one interesting idea is hidden in this bearded story.
Why should Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why change London's crom for this Brussels, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
On the contrary, Europe has gained the influence of the parties dedicated to the EU's resistance or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of Alternativa for Germany, founded this year, came as if it were out of nowhere, and nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, resulting in the Bundestag essentially the "excellent" of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil, he was always opposed to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The credibility dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank together with the convictions of the cable put on the national economy by lying to the common currency has brought many people into the view that Europe's project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that the national government is in charge of high budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members from exchange rates favourable to the German exporters – and German politicians want to keep it.
Without the possibility of devalvazing domestic currencies, South Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to reduce revenue and public expenditure – which calls on Germany.
The current problem with the budget and currency is a deeper cause of European small performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels, the code for support by French and German companies for consumer costs applies to the European industry twice as much as electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage in the cost area as we have seen in the case of Grafgemouth.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not reverse the collapse of the European petrochemical industry with a cheap shale oil from the USA.
The result is a compulsive rebellion, especially in France, once excited EU supporters.
After the war, the elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
Berlin, however, no longer needs political legitimacy as an ID and established its own economic policy in Europe and left its own consumed economy to its fate.
Result: The Right Wing Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and has pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front is now with 24% of votes the most popular side in France – early warning for British Labourers that they cannot judge that fission of the right is automatically shown on the left.
How does Le Pene use his newly acquired popularity between the white working class?
The next year's European elections would like to use it to create an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are going well in these elections, which is likely to be the first time such a block can dominate the European Parliament’s history.
In doing so, I feel that, in a timely fashion, the growing European feeling and attitude against the common currency will be joined and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free within the meaning of "Europeans (suvere) of the nations", has already given priority to General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and close itself to the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left with the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be areas (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – in this there is also the possibility to announce Berlin and Brussels, when we are meant to be.
I assume Scotland would have done well in a relaxed Europe arrangement, provided it has kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar minding countries would be easier in the unfaithful Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The Government of SNP in Scotland is – a buyer – the most successful political movement that does not implement the austerity measures in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition attitude towards cuts planned by the Labourian Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only in order to take economic measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Formerly advanced
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their Belarusian peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming
It is not demonstrated that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the starters of an earlier puberty could be an epidemic of obesity.
The puberty trend isn't that obvious in the boys.
The former rapporteur, CNN Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should the mother be scared when her daughter starts her breast growth and rage at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children’s Doctors in Florida this week, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents aren’t usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, shame and underpants, appear earlier in girls.
However, over the last 40 years, there has been only a small shift at the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age of 12.5 years is now compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
"When they develop their breasts, they will hear at least two or three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (An essential handbook for managing this common problem)
The most reliable test of puberty going on is time.
It is discussed what activates a real start of puberty, but if the breast growth is accompanied by a growth sparrow before 8 years of age, the girl is considered to be ‘early advanced’.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which will be carefully monitored by children’s doctors.
A faster growth can be a reason for the endocrimologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: early bone ageing, which can eventually lead to a halt in adulthood and growth.
Recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment depend on the child’s age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
As for the deployment of drugs, Kaplowitz is careful, but acknowledges that “repression of puberty can reduce the problems with the behavior of girls and its feelings that are different from their peers”.
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their dementia.
“They worry that she may get pregnant or how she will manage hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a dementia in 10 years.
Even though there were signs, and we talked about the menstruation, she was not ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no related set of evidence that hormones are found in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or the sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – achieve puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that obesity epidemic is the most serious reason.
In 2001 he helped to conduct a study in girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which combines body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
Explainions are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although it is not as obvious as it is with girls at a low age, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is in the girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and debilitating rage is common even in infants and backpacks.
"We must be careful with regard to how we identify the actual introduction of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their child doctor how to speak to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to the child before you assume it,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
The girls that develop earlier need to ensure that even if it happens early, this process is a common part of life.
Nada Konvalinková in the role of pub.
Has he got a new job?
The actress Nada Konvalinková (22) appeared behind the chip in the role of pub, and she really did it.
Is the popular Czech actress planning a change of profession and going to business in the pub?
Nada Konvalinková appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I've done it right away.
Even the boss offered to keep me busy, and I could feed my beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay at what I do today, with acting," she gave up a smile with Konvalinková, who was a guest for the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," she gave her taste to an actress.
A long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nová appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and in this new life, I can't drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to do," added an actor.
Aircraft manufacturers are crying about the width of seats, there are large contracts at stake
Among the leading aircraft producers, there was a dispute about the width of seats in the second class for long distance flights, which this month led to a bitter exchange of views on Dubai's air show.
The scope of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-term flights for the economic class – not just the one that the airlines would normally have preceded – but whose allocated space is the key to claims for efficiency in recent aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called on industrial standards this week, which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete for the biggest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is distributed – especially if 9 or 10 seats are next to each other – is the basis for economic performance claims on the proposals of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that an improved model "777X" will bring 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will bring up 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out after 9.
Giant aeroplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now ahead of a air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X gets overweight with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the launch of a new advertising war when the financials showed a picture showing three people stuck in a restaurant with the title “Do you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-range flights in seats that are more narrow than in regional turbovrtult aircraft,” said Airbus John Leahy’s sales manager.
People are bigger, as food supplies change, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
From the early 70s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern remote air transport, to the turn of the century, the average American mass of the U.S. Health Ministry increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years.
According to American health statistics, an average American in the 21st century has 100 cm belt.
Airbus claims that his rival is keeping the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have carried out a study that suggests that the seat expansion of 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
The Boeing dimensions of Airbus seats rejects and says that it is not within the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines will deliver charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more things than just on the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things that they believe must be done to be successful,” said Kent Craver’s expert on cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate their profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers there is a major room for elbows, but it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute, the race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least 700 billion dollars in catalogue prices is enough to avoid jazzes of the weight of the American and European exports.
As stated in July, the Reuters Agency, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest proposals for two-engine long-range aircraft than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance claim Boeing depends in part on comparing the design of 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seventh concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to push more seats, and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, who is leading to the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with that many passengers are for a thicker distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Fourty-five inches wide seat for passengers would be great, but the reality is that from the business point of view Airbus is motivated by the threat of model 777,” said the expert on the interior of the cab Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing don't provide seats, but they offer the airline a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Scested aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band to check their competitive arrangements.
While it is chasing comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Donedna Airbus stressed the need for a larger cab adjustment so that he offered larger seats for some of his planes in the alleys.
Experts say that, without the support of a single producer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards remains unheard, but it can discourage the sale of 777X.
The number of HIV infected was over 1,000 in Prague.
In the Czech Republic, the number of infecteds is growing every year.
In 2002, for example, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121 and 180 were already in 2010.
Last year it was infected 212 and it was a record number.
"About the fact that the number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavátý, which has led the Prague Light House for Patients for Years.
According to him, from January to September, there were 165 patients in the country, with HIV this year, which was 176 for the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Mediterranean there were 206 infected.
The diagnosis was heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezski or 116 from Ústecky.
At least infected come from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected in the past by blood transfusions.
Such a case, however, has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in over quarter of the century.
Six children were also born with HIV, and they were transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in the film Gravity are, but it's watched, it's beautiful, says experts
A fantastic film from space Gravitation for some time after the premiere sold the cinema in the Czech Republic.
In October, he was seen by the Union of film distributors of nearly 150 000 viewers and made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positive.
However, there are certain irregularities in it.
Server Lidovka.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Star director and planetary Brno): I like the scientific-feantastic films that I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
Film Gravity does not specify, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I've had too much of it.
You may notice the hair of Sandra Bullock, which seems to be unsustainable in a state of lawlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Stations are moving on a lot of different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers determine an unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of fire in a state of trouble.
They don't think the Skafandras would have suffered that kind of wound either.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into conflict with different objects and suits without much trouble.
The criticism has not been spared or a history cover.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth's orbit, according to some discussing, is unrealistic.
Besides, he wonders why the doctor was sent to space to correct the technique.
People also argue about lan's "nerional" behavior on the forums.
She says she's acting like she's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (star and planetary director hl. m. Prague): I have seen him only on a wide canvas yet clearly I can say, I have been charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And with such a story, the author has the right not to be strictly realistic.
"More than you mentioned incompatibilities, I was touched by how three times the space station with a degraded level of technique (the last Chinese) is shown."
"The Chinese will, after the end of the decade, probably look better than in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (the director of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in not breaking the laws of physics, and so naturally oriented viewers will appreciate that the moment of momentum, said by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including thin peels of atmosphere and polar radiation, close to the polar areas.
I'm sure they'll find irregularities in a more detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction for the circulation of various space trash on orbits in some scenes appears to be reversed than should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences): Some things have adapted the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and to the sky calling a sin against logic or natural laws, I have not noticed in the film and compared to other films of similar focus it is seen that the creators have depended on the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense it's worth calling the fact that Hubbl's space telescope is running around in a different orbit than the ISS.
As a result, there is a very different common speed and rescue operations would therefore not actually be able to take place in the way shown in the film.
In addition, at the moment of the Kowalsky department (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not see that the whole ISS would roll over, and therefore there is no clear origin of the forces acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they no longer dispute.
A new nicotine vaccine can take pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take pleasure in smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weil Cornell Medical Faculty in New York says that the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all methods available today on the market, but they have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to create an anticancer antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to generate the smooth flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine intervention.
During the tests of vaccination with the mouse, which was added to nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that have not been vaccinated, "weaked," researchers said, a sign that nicotine got in their brains.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they showed up as expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because it converts liver cells to a plant for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, and it would prevent the addiction to nicotine.
However, it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will have no benefit from it, and that will help them to get rid of this habit,” he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denys that it would affect Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the state committee for the surveillance of corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal rental at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeida, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government of controlled property.
On Friday, an independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) extended its search for whether Mr Obeid was lobbying in several state ministers to hire him at the Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in the tender after his completion in August 2005.
The Committee now examines the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeida's hidden interests in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by former Deputy Head of Mr Tripodi, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pressured the leases to go to public competition.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, rents were renewed for companies in Circular Quay, which brought Obeidov $2.5 million annually, without the need to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 until November 2009, was originally a fan of public competition.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeida, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted in ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodim and Mr Steve Dunn, the head of the port department who came to the resort after he worked under Mr Obeid in the fishing department.
"He was the subject of interviews during these phone calls to develop commercial rental policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible agent
Israel's military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Lazikija on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible administrator of Fox News Station.
This responsible agent specifically did not say what target it was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press Press Press Press reports the aim of the SA-125 Russian production missiles.
At least twice before this year Israel launched an air attack on the shipment of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke so that it could be agreed, while the chairman of Štěch was murmuring nespravy.
Heytman Chovan was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and is the symbol of the N.S.S.D. poverty.
The other gentlemen have mainly shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a basic and inexplicable, Vice-President Zaralek has made the most difficult conversation on TV.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than the ČSSD to propose the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdošková, the only one should not have an initial hendikep and I think it would have done its standard performance.
It's such a good solution that hardly one of the leaders will back him up.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was going on, and to continue without breaking the side.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without fear, build a minority government with only a blessing from the President of Babylon and without human beings, but with the Human Health Minister Hovorka, who is actually a believer social democratic.
This mini-minimum government would have great stability as it would enforce the proper referendum law and thus commit to support the president of the Okamura Dawn.
The Prime Minister of Babylon would finally agree with the progress of taxes, for it is sharp and will see that it is impossible without it.
People wouldn't bring any trouble, because Hovorka is the best bearer of what they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the ANO, even here would find a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to enter a risky government participation, but provide support, too, well.
Let's get some courage to Alice Gajdůsek!
Foreign visa-authors may undergo a “righteousness” test
With the government’s intention to extend police interventions, it considers a test of “righteousness” for foreign visa workers with a visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied in the framework of the criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fulfil unqualified positions or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labourist Member Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australian neighbors.
The 'Australans' statement to the “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very uncomfortable remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market," she said today for the Australian-Indic Institute.
Historically, it meant that the Belarusian labour force should be protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region had noticed the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article deals with 12 measures that were previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, who was dealing with officials for smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and others to consider.
Where the criteria for ‘rightfulness’ are accepted, the visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nominations are justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal connection with the holder or the relevant person of the sponsor’.
After previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also require the number of visa holders to be justified.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died suspected of a heart attack after he arrived at the asylum ship on Christmas islands this week.
A man's nine-year-old scared son traveled to Australia with him and after his father's death, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities and men were rushing to the hospital in Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as the first stage begins in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "to join the Great Britain together".
The Scottish Minister for Transport Keith Brown said he was co-operation with the British Government on this plan "excessed".
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completing Stage two, he will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated costs of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out further railway capacity and the possibility to improve travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better link Great Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that brings this is huge.
Without that, we are facing the crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will also be better connected across the UK through the Great, thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “The announcement today is a good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael called on him to " unequivocally" to support the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “High-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland an irresistible economic advantage, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.”
So we are thrilled to work with the British Government to explore the possibilities to bring high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bring all the benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government plans anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers in the next year and to joint decisions on further steps.
In conjunction with Bárta, inspection and analysis of the anti-corruption police have been arrested.
Information about arresting Vita Bárty began to spread on Thursday night when the report brought the server First Correction.cz.
The IMF DNES found that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Councils (GIBS), its people were supposed to arrest Bárt in the centre of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons.
The inspection addresses cases where there are police officers amongst the accused, but its competence also applies to civilian persons.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption officers is the head of the analysts and informatics of Jan Petržilek.
He worked for a security information service in the past.
The spokesperson of the anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehei has refused to comment on the fact that the media has to turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesperson’s inspection Radka Sandor but did not want to say anything about the case, she gave a reference to the City Prosecutor’s office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesperson of the representative of Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also from this non-concrete reaction, it can be revealed that the event took place, but it is in a covert mode that is not allowed to say anything specific.
This is also true of Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba.
He told the media that Bartu was representing "and in this matter," but given that it was classified information, Bart could not confirm or deny the arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bárt's arrest might be related to the former police president Petr Lessy.
Bárta and former VV Chairman Radek John, who was headed by the Ministry of Interior, were promoted to this function.
The dispute that set itself on fire between the expremier Peter Nečas and the VV even had to deal with the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this relationship to my person has taken place.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, Radek John, the true chief of the party, was then Bárt.
Bárta has now run for the election of the Úsvit movement, the MP's mandate has escaped him only immediately - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Tomio Okamura Dawn declared that he had no idea what this was about.
"Vit Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn direct democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced from Bárty Okamura, who before the elections said he gave Barret space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the eclectors.
Vit Bárta came to court in 2012 with his former associate from VV Jaroslav Škarka.
Rules on the use of electronic aircraft equipment will remain in Australia for the period of validity of this Regulation.
Travellers from Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones during startup and landing even regardless of the changes in the US to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Air Administration (FAA) has provided US companies with space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during the critical phase of the flight if the devices remain in the "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the predominant part of the flight, but many people are concerned that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but they have indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the short term.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it examined this notification but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions to obtain from crew members.
Virginia, which had already spoken to the CASA about the extension of the use of its vi-fi on-board entertainment system, has been amended, but has announced that the regulatory authority will be subject to its decision.
“We would welcome the CASA to conduct an analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless onboard fun), improve customer experience,” said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that, for the time being, it will stick to the current regulations.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
FAA prescriptions apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to thoroughly review the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will differ from the company to depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as the revision of manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passengers' information.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude,” said FAA.
In rare cases, the crew shall order passengers to shut down during the landing.
The group also recommended that the device be stored safely under the seat or in the storage space above the head during the take-off and the seat.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, there are plants in Singapore in bloom
In a shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings so that she can pay her daughter a school.
"We just bought a house with our husband and put all my money on it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across the areas in South-East Asia – where household debt increases – it is indeed that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, became a third factory on the ladder in Singapore this week.
The withdrawal of jewels is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as secure bank loans.
Stoprs in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above 15.4% of the rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, stopers have the advantage of not requiring the verification of the person (payment history) or of the receipt document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Therefore, with the pressure on families because of the rising cost of living and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a depleted monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-sized income are turning to the plant to deal with worsening financial situations.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted an increasing use of household credit mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for Asian bank credit.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the 80 percent of GDP ladder, which is an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
The economists also feared the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which only came from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the date showed the continuing weak exports and the weakening of consumer demand.
"The important thing is that, with increasing costs, people from medium to low [private scales] will try to complement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Won, economist in the Maltese bank CIMB.
Historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are proud to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change for cash their family jewels.
About 70 per cent of the items in the 200 city buildings are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get him back next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded up to 20% increase in the number of customers using its establishment in recent months.
Growth in the stored sector is so great that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbor Malaysia – where he has four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Jo Lee Chingová.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD, which it received this week at the Singapore Exchange.
While some of the discount creditors are under the fire of criticism due to high interest, Mrs. Jo says that the deposit offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not increase the debt directly.
“Containers stop objects that are already owned and that of personal property does not increase the debt of the household,” he says.
In the company, the assets are becoming more and more accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Besides, there's not just people in financial distress among those who use the plant.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold rods or Rolex watch, so they can reach up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are out of all sorts of ways.
“There are rich individuals who need to borrow for a short time because of their courageous business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Saving package worth $325 million for tasman health
The Federal Government insists that the rescue package worth $325 million for the peaceful health in Tasmania contains hard conditions to ensure that the government does not lose its funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Austral Union is making "sustainable measures" to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing island population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which, as we believe, will solve the specific problems that the state is facing,” said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains 31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey curtain operations, will help to remove debt.
The money is also available to the Hobart and Launceston clinics, better post-operative care, healthcare professionals training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
“These investments are responding to ideas that the leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmman health system,” said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister pointed out that the Tasmán government must require a strict reporting and materiality regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union, and report monthly on where additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Today Mr Wilkie said that $325 million will not be useless, “unless a real reform will follow, in order to lay the foundation for a more sustainable public health system in Tasmania.”
Yet, he praised the government for its response to his request for rapid assistance, which he first raised in the negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can expel public health from critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional procedures selected will significantly undo recent cuts.
The spokesperson of the federal opposition to health care, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a "cash."
"The reason why I'm here is that the Labourian Government has taken out 430 million dollars from our medical system," said TV for ABC.
You can't have a government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that's paying $300 million, and make it look like it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that neither one dollar from the rescue package will be issued on a higher red tape.
Guillaume Niloux adapted to Denise Diderota's new novel, which brings an exceptional film expedition and a seasoning, but it is also more boring than it should be.
They grow up in the 1960s in France and tell a mortified story about Suzanne, a young noblely sent by his family to the convent.
When he wakes up, he is experiencing extremely cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother, and for others he becomes an object of sexual passion.
The movie never goes to lust or sleepiness, and that's his problem.
The ceremony of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience a torture similar to wearing a thirsty shirt.
Skiareals want to discount families with children
Syria destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, said on Thursday, the Committee on Global Control for Chemical Weapons, while a sharp conflict broke out in the north of the country, near one of the places where toxic substances are placed, according to assumptions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also claimed that more than 120 000 inhabitants had been killed since the beginning of civil war.
Notification by the Chemical Weapons Organisation came in the day before 1 November,
the term that this organization established in Haag to destroy or prevent the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and mechanical equipment for the mixing of chemicals in order to create toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this principle of initial destruction is a major milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Harnessing equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including the hypnotic and nerve gas of sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday the fights in Safira, which experts are talking about as the headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage plant, the Syrian human rights observer, based in Britain.
The group of activists, which, through the network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
Of this, 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 soldiers from Lebanon's Hizbollah.
There should also be 2,202 government runners and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organisation estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops have fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaida for weeks.
The observation on Thursday indicated that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The battles undermined the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors, who, at their mission, have to deal with tight deadlines in the middle of the continuing civil war of Syria.
In a statement from the OPCW office, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team is now “a satisfied that he checked – and watched destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/fill”.
He added that "There are currently no other monitoring activities planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they finished their first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 seats declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites were "exempted and ... item(s) of the chemical weapons programme that it contained has been moved to two other designated sites which had been checked".
It was immediately unclear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places that the inspectors of the OPCW could not visit.
Syria agreed to the plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I am worshiping the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission as this organization has ever had," said the director of the observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment issued by the OPCW office.
Now, in his third year, he stands against himself in the Civil War primarily the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawit sect, will stretch the Shiite Islam.
As far as further developments are concerned, the head of the Watch Tower Rami Abdul Rahmán said that at the center there was a strong explosion inside the air defence device in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikija.
He said the cause of the explosion wasn't known.
Anger over a sentence brought over by a bomber of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 persons killed in the bomb attack on Bali in 2002 responded to the judgment brought about by the last of the engineers who were built before justice, and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on escape as one of the most wanted persons in south-eastern Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for putting together an explosive device used in a bombing attack.
In 15 years, he could be released on parole.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other points of prosecution related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, even though it could insist that a man with the nickname “Demoliation Man” (barrow) could have received the death penalty because of her reputation as an excavation expert.
This decision reinvigorated the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old Jane and Jenny in the destructive attack of Patek and others ten years ago.
She said with tears in her eyes that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built before the execution squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sara Club was compared to the ground when the strong load placed outside the parked van was fired shortly after 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber fired a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and when he was kept alive three times to the doctors he died.
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamia responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Mullas and Imama Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive is just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds more, it's not that bad.
Patek was in court last of the bombers in Bali.
The arrest has been avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011, Abbottabad was captured in the Pakistani town, where less than four months later the U.S. forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaeda Usama bin Laden.
During the FBI court, in his testimony, the intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect the connection between terrorist groups from South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He did not volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until now, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused to others.
Verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of an attack, which will be later this year, which will belong to the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological decorations on aircraft (but must not call their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices from gate to gate – in addition to calling from mobile phones – read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of unexpected new rules issued by the Federal Air Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers are not expected to change immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate how many aircraft meet the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for onboard crews and the Directive to store facilities in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
There are Delta and JetBlue among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"As a matter of fact, we can improve the enhanced use of electronic equipment very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as they close the door of the plane.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 3 kilometres, and the captain won't issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane falls to land, and do not shut them down until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during their take-off, landing and driving operations have indicated FAA.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been adapted to allow passengers to use the Wifi at a higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stevards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies – this will be a success," Glading said.
To be honest, we're tired of looking like "watchers."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometres of altitude, said the Agency.
The passenger will be notified to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices to the air system.
So there's still no words with friendly, online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as he was well known, fired from an American Airlines plane because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like laptops will still have to be saved for fear that someone might get hurt if they'd fly around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not define FAA, but the US Federal Committee for Telecommunications.
The FAA may cancel the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the State Committee on Transport Security, CBS News National Security Expert, said mobile phones were still considered to be a risk.
“Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause disturbance in the transmission towers,” Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee set up by the FAA management to examine this problem, proposed last month that the Government allow a wider use of electronic equipment.
The FAA has been undermining pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
The critic, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democrat of Missouri, claims that there is no legitimate reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that up to a third of passengers also forgets to turn off their devices or ignores them.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started to carry FM radio, technical additions of those times.
New airlines are much more exposed to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but they are also constructed, and approved by the FAA management to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at altitudes.
The plans for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The large majority of airlines should be adapted to the greater use of electronic equipment under the new rules, said Huert.
Current electronic devices generally radiate much less intensive radio transmission than in previous generation facilities.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimum transmissions when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who push to release restrictions on the use of these facilities by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company imposed their transport aircraft with Kindle electronic readers and carried out a trial flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Air Passenger Association said that he is convinced that the interference from these devices is real even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have said that there are only gruesome reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause air systems interference, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow passengers to switch off their equipment during flying by means of low visibility.
The travel industry has welcomed these changes, and according to them, a reasonable procedure for public passengers, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was aired from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One baptism was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after the Scottish company SPCA treated him in a rescue centre until he was healed.
Colin Seddon’s operating center said: “This one was likely to emigrate from North Europe when he caught a strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently, he's out of power and haven't been found on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was not able to fly again, so we were contacted by applications for help.”
At a time when he was baptized, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready for business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to join businesses and define what changes in the EU would like to see British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have introduced the largest and most complex surveys in which the leading British entrepreneurs asked about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of various sizes and from various sectors and regions.
The survey results will be a lot of surprises.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on the countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than cutting into a long and strenuous process of reforming European secret institutions.
When we asked their views on the specific political areas – from monopolic regulations to the laws on products – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulation are now overestimating the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement has expressed even 40 percent of large enterprises, i.e. traditionally the most pro-European society.
Finally, our survey by managers revealed this most eloquent knowledge, while the clear majority want Britain to seek to change the contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding that companies of different sizes and major business groups identified shows that the business sector is pushing for a "intentional change" to transfer the influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – to achieve changes in the contract and better agreements for Britain can result in up to 16% in voting in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister of the Government should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to improve the conditions of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this amendment will mean a significant shift from the current balance of power towards Britain.
A better agreement for the UK is perhaps and given how the euro area is going on its way for a closer economic and fiscal union, even more and more necessarily.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the results of our survey show, this means a refocus on trade and a major change in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: Spiping has gone too far!
According to AFP, the chief of the U.S. diplomat John Kerry in a videoconference between Washington and London came from spying on the United States.
However, according to the Minister, he served to reverse terrorist attacks.
"First confession from Washington" according to AFP, it sounded in the middle of a steep polemic on both sides of the Atlantic due to a scandalous revelation about the mass monitoring of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also became American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, like President Barack Obama has done, some of these events have gone too far and we make sure it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he was primarily defending the practice of the present.
The information collection is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of arrests, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings explode, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time about the assumptions," stressed Kerry.
He admitted, however, that the collection of information "in some cases came disproportionately far".
The affair around America's intelligence, allegedly following hundreds of million phone calls, broke in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans also followed the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Europe’s leaders did not hide extortion, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement that would affect or reduce the monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says a new gas era starts in Bulgaria
The opening of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
“We are seeing the gap today: the construction began on the Bulgarian South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Streams should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed forever.
Once the project is launched in 2015, the Bulgarian consumers will get gas from South Stream gas at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction is to begin in other countries in direction by the end of this year.
Gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2,2 trillion crystal gas alloys.
Hezbollah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
There's a decisive battle waiting.
The Lebanon movement of Hizbollah has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the Horny area of Kalalalun.
According to the further clarifications of Israel’s reports at Wednesday’s raids to two places in Western Syria, he destroyed the missiles designed to be Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shian organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the movement of arms to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
The reports of Wednesday Israel’s raids on weapons storage in Western Syria are being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but American sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian Dampress.com website, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea have hit the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Jajabel south of Latakija.
Al-Arabija reporting stations claim that two warehouses were hit, in which missiles were ready to move to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were missiles of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizbollah missiles and Syrian Air Forces teaches the members of the Hizballáhu section with missiles.
SA-8 is an obsolete rocket that has the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're located on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to mobility and small dimensions.
They're equipped with a radar, which, however, turns off after firing the missile, so it's hard to target them.
Latakija lies in the western Syria, in the area covered by the ruling alvanites.
This is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the past in fear in Western Syria.
They claim that it helps protect the Syrian Shiite community that the avalanche belongs to.
Now 15,000 of his warriors are supposed to be ready to help get the military back to Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah there, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is to be remanded according to the source of al-Arabi for the recent attack of the opposition at the Syrian Brigadier's headquarters, abú Fadla Abbás, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels in Kusajru just went to Kalamun.
Recently, most citizens in the Czech Republic seemed to wish for early elections.
Corruption, disbursement of money for over-the-counter purchases and public contracts, tax increases, and government scandals, have, last but not least, been reported.
According to the results of the elections, it can be argued that most citizens have complied with this situation.
That they didn't really mind and the state that was here (theft and debt of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not make their vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total by 4 394 028 in fact supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all the rightful voters.
Which is an overpoleal majority.
When I add 1 016 829 ČSSD votes to the above parties, then the old order (because all of these parties participated in the "divorction" and debt of this State), then in fact 64.23% of the rightful voters agreed with this condition.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty people to rob and extortion this state.
Or do you think that ČSSD members who participated in this were right laws?
Is he even helping us?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) were charged with prosecutions against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Board for Child Abuse has learned that, before the charges against children have been brought against the child bred by Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
But before the Commission it was said that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association indicated that in their organization they had never solved a case of sexual abuse of the child.
The executive director, Phillip Hare, was asked when one of the employees of the YMCA association was accused of abuses related to child pornography, and another, when the gym at Caringbah of the YMCA association in 1991, was convicted of sexual abuse of the children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furnness, the commission's consultant, he knew about the first case, but not the second one.
He accepted that the initial statement of YMCA was also unclear when it indicated that the organisation of the YMCA had carried out external audits which assessed this organisation as a prior advocate of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the organisation of the YMCA has been informed that the audit of the Ministry of Education and the company from August this year received the second lowest of four possible evaluations.
Mr. Hare, who began to work with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership had failed from his own direction down the road when Mr. Lord had accepted without ensuring that the personnel were aware of the obligation to report a violation of the children's safety rules.
In the past year, Lord was sentenced to 12 boys who he committed in the two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He's been trapped for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting a safety breach to Mr. Lord's children.
The staff provided evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including that Lord was with children alone, privately guarded, allowed them to sit in his lap, telling them he liked them, and had them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was subordinate to Lord's training for children's safety because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head for the services of children in the YMCA association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to talk about something.”
The Director-General said he didn't accept evidence of personnel that they didn't seem to know if they should contact their superiors and perform.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord prevented their judgment and therefore did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that the council of the YMCA association in New South Wales had given its opinion that the lesson from the “ Jonathan Lord case” to the organization lies in the fact that the staff “no report” and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the agreements on the maintenance of silence shortly after the charges appeared made the general manager for the services of children in the YMCA Liam Whitley organization.
He said that the aim was to avoid any disruption of evidence, but it was “excessly hot” and wrong-made.
The expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smalbtone of Griffith University, told the commission that YMCA in New South Wales, was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious recruitment problems, verifications, processing, training and management of personnel.
The hearing was delayed on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he'd take a chance to return to the Prime Minister's office, but he admitted that his return was unlikely.
In the night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the 59-year-old politician, he expressed his views on the different areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leading position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and his comments on foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador of the Bízkovod Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the Prime Minister's office, his answer to London's Evening Standard was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it seems difficult to do so, so..."
While a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to present horses to fight for the price of the Horse of the Year, everyone was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet going to school and only a few months ago he made the first steps, this little boy and his animal pet, the Shetland poet Toffee, smoothly cursed three rounds to finally win the prize and left behind 30 walking adults.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised at the annual competition by the Sunnybank riding centre in Rudry village near Cardiff for appearance, behavior and style.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, put his ram into a happy angle, and let his two-year-old Toffemenmenmen be around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest degree of insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given in March to his third birthday and since then with this Shetland ponie daily practice.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together."
They didn't have great hopes, but they finally left with gold cup and bouquets.
It was only the second time Toffe competed, and when he won, we were excited.
They all considered him phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take pictures of him.
The boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who demonstrated horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere, and they all encouraged and climaxed. ”
He ran the sand through the entire length of the arena and even though he worked so small, he gave great performance.
Fenton is obsessed by animals – loves horses, tractors and a farm and got two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition, and I'm sure he'll be fine.
The talker of the annual show-up contest said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
He's a great team.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed up on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the team work is between the ponie and the guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best.
I'm sure Fenton helped even the adorable clothes, he really fell in with him.
Too many surveillance papers are supposed to be investigated.
The Chinese newspaper, which was asked to release the reporter charged with this speech, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The newspaper New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about the company partly owned by the State.
The administrator said that the newspaper New Express will now perform a "full repair".
The regulation for "trust" came from state administration for press and publications, radio, film and television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express of the Yangchengian Group of Evening News issued several false reports on Zoomion’s mentioned company.
“The New Express Gazette was unorganized,” said the administrator in his statement.
He said that he had to decide "to make Chen Yongzhou an administrative sentence in the form of a cancellation of a journalistic licence".
In addition, “he ordered the Yangchengian Group of Evening News to perform an overall repair of the New Express letter, and recommended that they examine the responsible responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the direction of the New Express letter.”
Mr. Chen wrote a few articles for New Express that involved financial irregularities in a company called Zoomlion's construction equipment.
After being detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release and claimed to be his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then showed up on state television and admitted that he had published false stories for payment.
“In this case, I caused the damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said at the CCTV State Intelligence Station.
I did it mainly because I was playing with money and glory.
I realize I acted badly.
After an apology, Mr. Chen published a letter of New Express on the front page of the apology, in which he said he failed when he did not make sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, several highly monitored suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of the Law this year, which forbids the authorities to force anyone to charge themselves.
A tunnel was found for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel with dimensions approximately one times one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they've ever discovered.
Tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of vague warehouses, where freight wagons can be easily hidden before the drugs are loaded.
The authorities said that the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
With the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine in court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of condemnation, they face sentences of freedom from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, the smugglers in Arizona penetrate large draining channels.
Tunnel has been the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered in October after the marihuany harvest in central Mexico, which, before the drug cartels, raises the problem of getting their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres, equipped with rails, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and Centres are linking management.
They will offer, for example, a joint offer.
The new integrated newsroom of Economics in Prague, Karlín.
Economia has taken another step to transform the Centre holding into her media home.
From Friday, Economics and Centre have a joint management.
"The unity of the organizational structure and the personnel of the Union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into the common media home," comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Board of Economics and the appointed Director-General Kamil Čermák.
Čermak, who will be in charge of single management, will complete the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil, a new joint trade director, was appointed as joint director, who is under the authority of both Zuzana Tilčerová.
Štěpán Burd became the new chief of information technology.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, who is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
A newly established function of the Marketing Director was entrusted to Adéla Pitts.
The unit of corporate communication itself is now under the control of Vír Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers leads Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure, among other things, enables us to come to the market with a joint offer of advertised products, to better link the content of all titles issued and, last but not least, significantly improve the company's business management," Čermák added.
The company Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a purchase agreement for Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
The portfolio of the Centre Holdings consists of servers News.cz, Women.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail bases under the brands of Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najstero or portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is a publisher of Business News, IHNED.cz news server, weekends Respekt and Economics, as well as B2B titles printed and printed.
Among the Czech publishers, the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles for the long term.
This June, publishership moved to new modern premises in Prague, Karlín.
CME targets television business.
They'll release nearly a quarter of people.
The media group CME will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to send out thousands of people.
The sector only wants to focus on its main business, television broadcasts.
A group that owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia employs approximately 4,500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much savings will be touched by the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic television one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature, and we can't really comment," said the director of communication Novy Josef Koukolíkek.
According to the information provided by MF DNES, the Czech Republic's significant release will not be avoided, but this should have a close impact on CME's personnel status in Romania and other countries.
Both the new chiefs of New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after Adrian Sarbu's long-time director during the Wednesday conference call with analysts, spoke about the fact that they wanted to limit all activities that are directly unrelated to television business.
Therefore, it is quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing its own programmes, film and production activities.
In the industrial premises of the ČKD in Prague burned down a cooling tower in the night
In the industrial premises of the ČKD in Prague, the large storage tank burned, according to the fires apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire was driven by firemen on Thursday 11 o'clock this morning," said the spokesman of Prague firemen Pavlín Adamc.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding area according to measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damage and causes of the fire are unknown so far.
About five dozen firemen arrived on Kolben Street.
"One of the fires of a large storage tank, probably a cooling tower," said Adamc.
"There is no functional hydrant net in the area, so we are calling through the transport line from cisteren," she added.
According to the tn.cz server, the hacking of a misfunctioning hydrant network complicated, therefore the firemen had to adjust the water from another.
Fire Force Commander has declared a second degree of fire alarm.
It's a total of four, fourth in most serious situations.
They also went to the site to verify the peace of dangerous substances that could have gotten into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of harmfuls which would exceed the hygiene standards," said the spokesperson of the firemen.
The British police delivered Assange a notice of release
The British police today announced the release of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge in the Ecuadorn embassy in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that 40-year-old Australan had told him that he wanted him to come to the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be threatened by arrest.
Assange, under the British Law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court of Justice lifted his appeal against the issue this month, and thus facing the issue of a sexual offense charge in Sweden.
Since he was afraid that Stockholm would release him to the United States on June 19th, he sought asylum on Ecuador’s embassy in London.
Scotland Yard “said a notice of the release of a 40-year-old man who asks to come to the police station on the day and hour they were designated to him” said the spokesperson.
Assange continues to violate bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notice of issue.
Assange is afraid he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face the charges of espionage because on WikiLeaks' website he published 250 000 U.S. diplomatic documents.
Driver received a £1,000 fine for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink located between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 Road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a cup of drink between her thighs.
At Colchester Howi's police court, he confessed to charges that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points came to his account as a result of which he received a six-month ban on management.
It was also ordered to pay a cost of £90 and an advance for the accused £100.
As a result of taxes on owners of foreign real estate, London's bubble is a Prague bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally set out a tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but awaits Mr Osborn's final decision, which introduced a charge of 7 % for the real estate transfer to buildings in excess of 2 million pounds and annual buyers who own the property within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the payment for the transfer of real estate in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached £708 million in the tax year 2012/13, beyond the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “With regard to the increase in the transfer of real estate at home of high value and the presentation of related legislation, which is intended to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is not taxed much regardless of the effect of the obsolete system of tax on the head."
He added that ‘this step could have caused certain foreign investors to sell their properties in London, or that existing owners were going to sell’.
The first property – the upper 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price – in a rich zone that dates from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11,8 % for last year.
The prices in Wednesday London continue to show a year from the year of continuous growth of 5.6%, but they were depleted by a flourishing ‘home market’ on which, according to the survey, Savills experienced a southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5 %) increase.
Scientists have shed more light on how the tail movements related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs drill more right (from the point of view of the dog) while nervous dogs have tails mostly left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can notice and respond to these fine differences in the movement of the tail.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at Trent University said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different links to suggestions that stimulate positive or negative emotions. ”
The same thing we tried to look at in other species.
He added that as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get further information about how dogs react to the unsustainable drilling of tails of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analysed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long until we understand why their tail goes on one side at a time, and another by another.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have been showing dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or in the form of silhouette – to get rid of any confusing suggestions, and we have also been able to improve the movement of the tail and show it more right or left.”
When animals saw a different unimaginable dog moving the tail to the right (from the sight of the dog drilling the tail), it remained perfectly calm.
But when she recorded tail production mostly left to left (a sign from the look of a dog drilling the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals were acting uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think dogs would communicate knowingly through these movements.
Rather, it considers that dogs have learned from the experience they must and may not be careful about.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail one direction is repeatedly connected with friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond to this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dogs, vets and trainers to understand their animals’ emotions better.
A dog expert John Bradshaw, a high school teacher at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study to investigate whether the left and right side of the dogs was important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their head off on the left when they watched an aggressive dog, and on the right when they looked at a happy dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “With a dog’s robot, the dogs were more likely to be able to find their tails to the left than to the right, when they were rather uncertain – exactly the opposite of the Italian study. ”
The difference may be given according to him by dogs in these different studies of animals in film or dog robots did not entirely appear to be dogs.
He explained that she could help study on how dogs react to actual dogs.
"Although there are reasonable evidence in the case of many mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still needed to clarify – and dogs are not an exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to notice their behavior, it may not be long before we understand why their tails are going on one side and another on the other.
Arctic Monkeys, due to Alex Turner's illness, moved a concert at Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with inflammation of the larynx.
The Sheffield group was supposed to perform on Friday at the Hydro City complex.
The disease of Alex Turner's lead singer but forced her to move the performance.
The announcement of the group came after it was similarly forced to postpone the Thursday performance at the LG arena in Birmingham.
In his official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group states: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance at the LG arena in Birmingham, and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys Group must postpone a performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday on 1 November.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with inflammation of the larynx, and unfortunately he will not be able to step out."
This will take place in the LG arena in Birmingham on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.

Pope František calls the first Cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis, on 22 February, first named the new Cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are those who vote for the Pope, so Francis will set up his first group of men who will eventually help to choose his successor.
Now it's 201 Cardinals.
But as soon as the Cardinal reaches the age of 80, the Pope’s election can no longer take part – the group is reduced to 120 elected Cardinals.
In the statement announced by Lt. Federico Lombardi, spokesperson of Vatican, he said that before the solemn promotion of the new Cardinals, the assembly of current Cardinals, known as the Consistration, will take place.
“Papež Frantisek decided to give his decision to call the February congregation in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the list Catholic Voices said that the number of elected Cardinals will probably fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually names as many Cardinals as needed to increase to 120, and as many Cardinals as he wanted over the age of 80.
The Consistituency next year will be significant because it will be the first to be elected by France in March of this year, said Valero.
At this point, there are some orientations on Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of Cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of Cardinals since František established the Cardinals' Council, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, which he has given the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“The modern Francis selected these eight Cardinals to help him,” said Valero.
He said it was possible that these Cardinals of the Pope would ask for counsel.
However, in this situation we were not before – it is completely new.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places, but František is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he is calling. ”
GM downloads some new light trucks in the US for repairing seat-backs
According to a fifth notice from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19 000 of its new (2014) light trucks from Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the failure with manual loading of the back.
For some of these vehicles, the system of loading of the front seats of the defect may have a mechanism.
As a result, seat restraints are not in accordance with the federal standards of vehicle safety for head restraints.
The announcement on the road safety website of the state of transport safety (NHTSA) says that "if the vehicle from the rear gets hit, the head restraint does not need to protect passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury".
The models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM introduced the supply to the market in June and for this leading American car, it is the most important to place the vehicle on the market from the restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the vans about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notification to owners due to the 16-day government failure, which weakened car sales in October.
The sales of supply of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the models of 2014 increased over the first 10 months of this year to about 20 percent, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 models of Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models.
The shares in the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to 37.47 USD.

I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year at the Faculty of Medicine, I would be encouraged and restored to hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patient reports tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired by millions of people and speeches took away your breath.
The elections ended with a rough balance and television intelligence forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were so happy, and my parents kept the papers they got.
A young visionary team headed into the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
Obama had 82 percent of the aid when added to the Office in 2008.
And I'm closing this book.
Go to the moment is a rough awakening, like talking from sleep.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of the wasted opportunities.
In the years after I put my first election ticket, there really was a change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the law on the available care of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics “for nothing to ask, nothing to say” after the death of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that party obstructions have returned so much to move our nation forward: among others it is immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations where I defended Obama's administration in front of my colleagues and my friends, I, as regards the explanations that they can provide, have reached an absolute limit.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The construction of the Republicans cannot explain the consent of listening to foreign leaders, nor the raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it follows those who wrong the government’s conduct.
They cannot be held responsible for execution of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without a proper court of law, nor for limiting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They cannot be justified by the findings of the report, which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... of the Nixon administration”.
And they can't even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this could have been expected.
Whether I was 18 years old to know that government power could be contrary to political campaigns that preceded her.
Apparently, the free function has no predictable course, and our public interviews will form a opposition political party and an emergency, such as Newton's massacre.
However, all the examples I set out above seem to be largely the result of my own administration decision.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted both again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confused and unbroken alternative and seemed to be unable to strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes that we once heard of.
Nevertheless, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support dropped below 45% this week – through this book is becoming more and more difficult.
He's making me remember that series of promises that's been made.
This week, I read in my book on Obama's primary career in Pennsylvania, and he suffered a rough defeat with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave programme
Military and Member Clive Palmer says that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with interest over the parental leave programme, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Báňský magnate, which leads the dispute due to the payment of the tax cut from coal worth $6 million, made this claim when he tried to appear from the table the question of whether it is in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which will play a major role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit from the policy in question.
"He has entered into a great conflict of interest as regards a paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting a parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the fairfax chair in the Sunshine Coast district due to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an examination of the electoral results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget's daughters.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the electoral rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and have the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the votes.
The point is that the results can be lost if they don't like anyone?
These days, and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The electoral committee studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political agenda also applies to the Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new work "very seriously".
Public authorities are public service.
“We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society in this critical period,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists find out he's washing your hands for you and NATURAL.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two had a task to solve an unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, after failure to wash their hands, was more optimistic than the ones where her hands did not wash.
Also, the group "washed hands" did better than the other one in the next test.
Yet, those who washed their hands felt worse in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of a third group whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the test show according to psychologists that physical purity removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, there is a decrease in motivation, testing must be much more focused in further tests.
If we were to transfer the results of research to Bohemia, we would probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the WC, it does not wash its hands only one percent of the Chech and Czechs, but it is already 5th on the road to the city transport.
Most of them lie in hygiene after work in the garden or in the workshop, where their hands wash 85 percent of people.
The absorption of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovenians, however much it is necessary to wash your hands after hand is given to a stranger.
In this situation, hands wash 28.8 percent of Bohemia and 40.3 percent of the Slovenians.
The research showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the scene, I'm afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little bit better," comments Klaudia Komárková's skin examination.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons known for the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) is suspended by two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspected monetary-market machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities on investigations of the world's largest financial market, where they change the owners of 5.3 trillion dollars every day.
The mention of two traders would be the first staff of the RBS suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is referred to a scandal with the manipulation of the LIBOR rate (londian interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment, but confirmed that it had received information from the authorities this month.
“Our unscrupulous search in this matter continues, and we fully cooperate with FCA and our other authorities,” said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people who have close to this event said that RBS handed over records of e-mails and quick messages to the British Financial Authority and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010, and is expected to have been released from his current position as President of European Foreign Trade in Foreign Exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, President of cash trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Head of Monetary Trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders was charged with any violation.
Mr. Usher's group for sending quick messages was owned by bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS submitted that, after the Swiss control body Finma announced that he investigated suspected machinery on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it took steps against one of its employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss anti-monopolies office of Weko, FCA, the Department of Justice in the USA and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – examines the claim that these bankers have agreed to move the monetary market.
In addition, the people of the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse launched an internal investigation or received an information request from the competent authorities.
Banks have been clearing up years with old rapid reports and e-mails to find some kind of misdemeanors.
The investigation reports alarmed businessmen in the area, which was one of the biggest engines to generate profits in the closures of the investment banks in recent years, but which was disturbed by the fact that the small insurgency of the currency reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they claimed that it is essentially impossible to manipulate with a large and high liquidity market with foreign currency, but high positions of traders say that it does not necessarily need to be true.
The high-profile trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign exchange of liquidity spread between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that this week she released from her department for trading in a trader who caused a loss of almost USD 6 million in the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
The doctors in Prague have registered over 1,000 people with HIV.
From the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests have confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropole.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,63 were infected in the Czech Republic.
In 396 Immunity disorder, it's already stuck.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic is growing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121.
In 2009 the examination revealed 156 new diseases and 180 in 2010.
However, the previous numbers fell to 153, last year was recordable.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"About the fact that the number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," says the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavátý, who has been leading the house of light to patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and in 47 last year, said the Hlavátý.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
Most infected was in Prague.
Whoever really wants to get to know a town should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the national center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal his bed.
Many people "read the graves."
They slowly roam the cemetery and obtain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people here live, what kind of nationalities such as faith, how big and coherent families belong in what age they die in, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were for them.
In what way they express their social status as they have taste.
And from the grave condition, they will find out how they care for their dead bodies.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Law
The Supreme Court in the United States has decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama administration.
By a vote 5:4 the Court decided that an individual regulation on the protection of patients and the available care, which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 otherwise threatens to pay fines, does not resist constitutionally on the basis of government tax jurisdiction.
The President of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of receiving sickness insurance, in the contrary, is not forced and contrary to the Constitution.
In order to block this law, 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have submitted a complaint.
During the 2012 prime minister, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
The words "Mugabe is a round donkey" are no longer at risk of prison, the law has repealed
Until now, the Zambobnads had to pay good attention to how the public talk about the ninety-year-old Mugab, who has been in charge of the country since the early 1980s, has been standing in her forehead since the end of 1987.
Pursuant to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, 100 dollars or one year of freedom has been threatened by the President's Office for misrepresentation.
"The National Representatives should not fertilize people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government has appealed against the court's decision, the British BBC has informed.
Against the law, many of the damaged Zimbabwans, including Tendai Dang, who were arrested by the police two years ago for the alleged execution of the president in a fight with a police officer in a bar.
In May he ended up in prison with a opposition activist frequenting in the public by Mugabe's "culse donkey".
In August, the prosecutor later accused a man of 60 years old because of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court also declared anti-legislative law restricting media freedom.
"The father cannot punish people whose statement later turns out to be untruthful," said the Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malal.
Until now, the Zimbabwean law has made it possible for a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalizes someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to speak freely," Malala added.
Notwithstanding the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country for over 33 years, it has adopted in March Zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum a new constitution with wider civil freedoms.
A small step towards the dictatorship of one man of the country came in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the Prime Minister's chair.
Earth, however, continues to suffer from an economic crisis and, until 2008, the world’s highest inflation, which has exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely repealed the national currency.
Today, only currencies of other countries apply to Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy goes to Mugabe's inconvenient agricultural reform.
In 2000 he divided the land of white farmers between his supporters and war vets.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience in keeping with the Pharisees.
Central banks maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks made it their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," said Julian Callow, the main international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"Although all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, Chief economist BH Secretities.
Central bankers strengthen the bond that began to occur in 2007, when the international credit market went down for the first time.
The central bank agreements have enabled access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its US economy support programme, which could eliminate the price of money in the global market even higher.
The Swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of the second currency.
It can be understood as a share of one currency and the borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European bank.
The EU has agreed on bank supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport does not have personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz website.
But then I didn't finish it, because someone was sitting at the branch office who couldn't complete the registration from the internet.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration fell through, then I moved, and that's why I changed my address and my identity card number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I could not, because I have another OP number, address, and that I could just not finish it, and that I should ask for data removal and make a new registration.
So I did that, and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I am asking for the removal of all my personal data from the database under the applicable Personal Data Protection Act.
The big day, she wrote technical support for me to complete my registration at the branch office.
That started with the marathon e-mails for technical support, where after 4. Ukrainians 25.10 they wrote that they erased personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could make a new registration, and here again the problems started to me first wrote that my username was already occupied (the understanding was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end it also eliminated this).
So I used another user's name and it came out to me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something that claims to be erased) so I contacted the technical support again.
On my question, how do they describe it to me that they actually erased personal data 25.10. and that I send an e-mail with that mistake?
This is what I did (on the last day of about 15 hours) and today they wrote down for me that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why it's not because I used the same name and date of birth.
What's the point is, I've been in touch with technical support for a week, and I'm still dealing with them, and I can't do it.
And what if the truth of what it claims (as if it is not) could not register no one with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22, I actually registered myself, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fancy e-mail and a phone number and the world wonders, there was a page that sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register to the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and data just didn't remove it as he claims.
So I've told this technical support again that they just lie (be intentionally and or don't know what they're saying) because what they're saying isn't true.
I added several screens that the registration problem was already 31.10 ago, so "false" registration doesn't simply affect this.
Tipsport gave me a special statement - I'm sorry, but by re-registering you, we can't verify your claims.
And he ended the communication.
Respektiv repeats over and over again the same sentence that registration refers to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and did not actually run.
So if I summarize, Tipsport not only did he not delete the data he claims, but he still lies when he says otherwise.
What's worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things were made a little bit moving, and from Technical Support, an e-mail came that things were being handed over to check and I will be informed (after a week of detection and guessing and alerting the same mistake).
In the subway, music is played on the Bridge
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) started the Music project in the subway.
The first vestibule, where during the operation of the subway continues to play reproduced instrumental music, is Bridge line A at the exit of Wenceslas Square.
Testing's going to take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double, band and three singers
Textist Michal Horáček brought to the Hall of Kolinian City Social Home not only his completely new 2CD Czech calendar, but above all in the show between us singers Lenka Novou, František Sagrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by excellent Orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the opening intru and acting etuda about late music gradually invited Michal Horáček to the stage all three singers, himself came with a candle in his hand and remembered the last time they played in Cologne and the theatre and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Jinak in Cologne produced two kinds of cards with which I came into contact," he reminded.
He also reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do tour of the Order or Dúbřivence at Bratislava," he argued about other presidents' natives.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage, and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music.
The calendar was done by Josef Mánes, who put him on an eagle, about ice hockey, but at that time had no idea how we were meeting in these squares and chanting who didn't jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one of the Czech calendar songs, but we're not playing here tonight," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a lot of suitable Sleep for him from this board on the day, singing at night and accompanying her at the guitar.
Otherwise, if he wasn't singing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vacalists together sang a bit of a take-off into the heart, sitting in a corner of the heart, which immediately blew up the auditorium.
"I am glad that the song caught you, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapku, I recognize in the introduction of František Sagrada, in the original from Richard Muller, awarded by a huge aployment, Hana Heger again reminded the composition of Dad liked Lida Baar and the Horášková explanation about the communist ban and replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába again reminded the composition of Sebastián, Sígrado then sang a wonderful song from Prague music by Jarda Svoboda, the sad familyman and former Kolíňák.
This was already the conclusion, the applause in standings and additions in the form of optimistic compositions We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more addition ready at the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer up anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire reader was behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his book, and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested parties took a picture.
Berdycha will be completed by Štěpánek Rosol and Hájek
At Davis' finals Cup against Serbia, he no-noting captain of the Czech tennis team Jaroslav Navrátil was the fourth quarter of Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech trophie representatives defend, but they go on the field to play the opponents in the Belarusian arena, where the match takes place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The finals are the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground that it's gonna be wild and we have to always focus on our performances."
"We will go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, a striker of winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American comedian in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf of Peri.
The Israelis just showed what Syria's supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary lobster, threats, and millions of statements sent out planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without letting them taste the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event, and they are no longer speaking into it.
The exact opposite of confused and large, the acts of Obama's Syrian policy.
And the calmest thing about the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't let the media get confused by their claims that the 'Syrian base' or 'Hezbalah delivery' has been bombed.
I recently wrote here that while the help of the U.S. secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia continues to supply Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakija became the target of Israel's air raid.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And notice that Israel once again bombed Assad’s regime, not the rebel, although it would be contrary to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has 2 members of the sleeping unit, possibly Delta force.
It was not known until now that they were marked during the attack on the American consulate in Bengáza.
It is known the heroic death of the two former SEALs, who fought the CIA's premises in the city, I think it was the members of the CIA's secret office, which was formed by former soldiers.
For a long time, they speculated what SEALs did at the consulate or even somewhere located by the CIA.
It's more clear now.
In any case, information is that the CIA has, in Libya, its office protected by machineheads (almostly, both members of the SEALs perished after an intervention by a minomet), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is information about the two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. police station in Tripoli, and as soon as they got a report on the Bengáz attack, they volunteered to engage and, along with five private contractors, they fired off the way to the CIA in Bengáza.
Obama’s administration is pleased that during the attack, the command was not officially imposed and all and that it was just hesitated to do.
Commander of Command, he'll probably release these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not at one time, but the permanent U.S. comms, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing like that has been officially admitted, and even now it's only about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US, even though half-circumcised, is trying to wipe out terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place I want to write about is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost sung Iranian air force for prosecuting American drones.
However, it is almost known how Americans protect their drones effectively.
Of course, if we happen to be able to show up our drone in the airspace, there's nothing we can do about it.
However, if Iran's drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in an international sea area, when it might have been the first sharp deployment of an American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
That guy drove the Phantom to optically verify his weapon, without a hangover, or he just noticed him on the radar, and then suddenly, when he showed up at his place and invited an Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to him without repelling.
There's nothing to be surprised about where the Phantom is an American production aircraft, but he remembers a war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzen still can win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in recent years, the defender or backup officer Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the representation after a year.
He also manages shooting, moves his activity, he's got a ticket kick in the heat game.
Viktoria took a single point from these two duels in the last two rounds against Slavia and the Temperatures after victory, but in the end, she took one of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team in a fight with the Jablone will break the unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat the Pablo at home," Frantisek Rajtoral promises.
Mankind is carefully preparing for a tough game with the Severoches, who play the offensive football.
Everything goes to play with Jablonce, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw much from the video choice of the game opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday night," attracts Czech fan representative for the Doosan Arena Tribune.
The last matches did not come out as she would, but the word of the defenseman Victoria's word is rejecting.
That's how football goes, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be okay," says the defender of the Westers.
The Victoria Man will rely again on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them a prize," says Rajtoral.
Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really one step at all, but a big jump - a jump for a few years back, and that's until memory, until my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like not to worry about and just come out of school and clean up dishes and do your homework.
Even though these "responsibilitys" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing a bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a drink.
Then on Helena's show and her boys, we're going to have to put on a three-legged table for our grandmother's birthday.
And then after several warnings to wash the dishes, to expel, in winter to carry wood into duck stones and tasks to do after dark under a lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the task of writing a loved ones addressed to school love).
In the morning, I would like to eat a homemade jame (from a real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the content of which is not even a qualm) and drink the tea from the dried herbs that my mom and I were so happy to gather.
I also remember those magic nights when the graves were quiet in the room when we recorded radio songs on tape that were loudly filmed in an old tape recorder after my mom.
And then on the pencil, we replayed those tapes, and they kept going around one same song, our favorite song, and they were drinking with a syphony to do that.
Or we called through the table using the backpacks that were tied to each other by a string - and since we've already heard better from the phone, it was necessary to clean our ears, then the ear was a serka + wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live out of it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPads, no iPads, not even cell phones or laptops or branded clothes.
The dressing was passed from generation to generation and the best "roast" in the wardrobe was a battery T-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
The electronics were enough to satisfy the mentioned mamma's tape recorder, and so was Walkman, who we shared with our sister, and who, by the way, we used just as much as a train on a school trip.
We were more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I already said to go out.
When I was a little bit older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents saved him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't get warm for a long time.
My little sister used to pry into him, said he was so good at sticking those tapes, so she tried to see if he'd rub even the scrotum.
Unfortunately, he was asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, this incident has until today, poor man, on dad's plate all the time.
She says when Lenka was little, she used to rip into the video, and she thought she'd play her recipe and not lose it, which is why she can't make it.
I remember the way we've all been able to communicate with each other, to talk without a cell phone, computer.
My sister and I talked to our grandmother's granddaughter next year and we'll meet her at Grandma's next summer, so that's how it pays.
We're together.
Promise someone you'll see next year!
I also remember the winter when we were running outside with the village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill at a church in a bag of crammed hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we were talking to our sister before every dinner with a notorically known sentence: "Let your hands be washed!"
Yes, that also applies today, but I'm sure you don't have a tap attached to soap in the lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" by beer with Jarda from the village, we sat on the floor with Mom, leaning on the feet of the duck stove, opened the door, and watched the flames and listened to the cracking wood that was made of the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we have on the social network, we knew how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various cottages, texts.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew far more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at the albums, where they are carefully glued by black corners of black and white pictures.
And if I didn't happen to know how old I was then, the back of the picture is always written for a year.
I'm looking at the fact that even though we didn't have much of the cut-offs according to the pot, and we had two numbers on our cousin's pants, no one ever laughed at us, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back to reality about the step forward.
By 2013, and I will wait for what modern times will come up, for example, once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are for a young teen generation now, at least somewhere, "one years behind monkeys" and I think they're missing a lot of money, that they're not going to live.
I wish they had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents that were lost by Nortel on Thursday, filed an action against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was translated during the auction in Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar concept, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, was sued in the US District Court of Texas by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and another four companies for patent violations.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine the terms sought on the Internet with the advertising in question, gives an action, which is the core of Google’s search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately affected.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android’s operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and ultimately offered up to $4.4 billion.
After the fight for patents Nortel was defeated by Rockstar, he won Google for $12.5 billion by Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by Motorola's patent group.
"In spite of failure to obtain patents which are the subject of the dispute, Google patents violated and continues to violate," says the plaintiff.
Rockstar is seeking an increased compensation for damage from Google because, according to it, there is a breach of the patent by Google intentionally, as the plaintiff claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
At first, she had a smile, the one she kept putting on a show as a defense of a friendly neighborhood.
She was very relieved because it was a mask that she decided not to postpone in public.
He was honest at home only on days when his grandmother was, and she was holding grandkids or Adík around her.
And of course, when her sons were on the phone.
You remembered a lesson from endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really good at it.
So she doesn't have to fuck up her nearest.
Then he went into the corner.
Like a masquerade disguise.
The November, not even another month can't make that miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt refers to the office of the first elected President
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day is just hard to end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “New Egypt” when he was named to the office as the first free elected president of this country, after Husní Mubárak, who was appointed 16 months earlier.
At his entry into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the State from the climax of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore an oath to 18 judges dedicated to black plates in a mansion built with views of the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for better tomorrows, the new Egypt and the Second Republic,” said Mursí at the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60 - year - old engineer, educated in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been, for most 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization, the target of the violent attacks of individual governments.
As soon as Mursí arrived in a small car column after 11 o'clock, hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met outside the court building to celebrate the President, and unlike the presidential manifestations of Mubárak's period, transport was only temporarily stopped so that the colon could pass through usually a busy road connecting the city center with suburbs in the south.
The personal prestigious Mursi, mocked as a nearismatic "red tire" of Muslim fraternity, has grown rapidly from his victory and his fifth speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who want to lead the rebellion to the authoritarian Mubárak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursí, dedicated to a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wood-inclusive chamber where he swore an oath.
Later, Mursí traveled to Cairo, where he was supposed to present an inaugural speech.
While he was standing alert, he got an official welcome from a military band that played a national anthem.
This was the military commander of the field Marshal Husajn Tantáví.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal of “armament and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a bast of Islamic student movement.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on the Tahrír Square on Friday, in a place where the revolution was born, which ended up with the authoritarian government of Mubárak last year, and promised to take over the presidential powers taken by his office by the military council which took over from the outposted leader.
But by agreeing with the formation of an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as it is used, the will of the army, indicating that the fight for power will continue.
Mursí's speech on the Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in ghettos to ease tension
Police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend up to half their burials here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from the surroundings.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts.
According to him, the country would have helped to improve the situation mainly "a well-defined social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to analysis, there were 300 poor houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was fucking usury.
According to experts of problem locations, hundreds have arrived in the meantime.
Relations between their residents and others are increasing.
In several places, anti-Romane marches took place.
The extremists were added to the neighborhood as well.
According to the interior, police are demanding in areas with ghettos security and order to maintain.
The basic condition is that "the consistent application of equal enforcement approaches".
It is said, however, that without detailed knowledge of the place and people, it is not possible to achieve this.
A specialist would go to a funeral in ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
He'd be keeping an eye on order in a problem location.
He would also know locals, so he could solve problems or violations better.
"Thanks to the bounded trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of infringements," said the intra.
Specialists in ghettos would get extras, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is around EUR 600,000 (i.e. around CZK 15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, 85 percent of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being drawn up.
The project is due until 2016.
The authors inspired themselves with the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money will be spent on these members of the police after the project has been completed annually.
According to the draft proposal, first the police will attend their internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should pass through this training each year.
They'll be the best candidates to come from.
Special education should also be developed for police officers who will act in ghettos.
According to authors, social housing would help improve the situation.
It is said that it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea, there should be three categories of interiors.
Minimum standards would be met by hostels with exactly the rules laid down, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standard should be social flats that would be comparable to normal housing.
Purchasers would have to follow up with an integration plan to build social workers with them.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send their children to school, requalify themselves and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would have gone to a higher standard of housing.
The free housing system should operate according to the interior for at least 30 years until the next generation "in a pro-integrated environment" grows.
The social housing model is designed by resorts for local development and work.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drobek: Uhlerský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Carbonic hill is an obvious hill 3 km southeast of Brunthal.
Together with several others, there is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník in the time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last erupts were here at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, on the top of the Uhlerský Hill, the visibly white is reflected in the Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Secondary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The man who stood next to the church did not behave.
Shortly after the church was finished, the alley from the four rows of the video was planted, about 1 km long.
The crossroad to the Uhlřiřské hill is the third version, the original stood here after 1916, the second from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
On 15 stops there are wooden plastics that made the local art carving artist František Niemiel.
He used different types of wood in the area of Low Jeseník.
Similarly, the undercarriages from the mines of the local area form an interesting geological exhibition.
For each stop, the name of the sponsor is also indicated.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Although data from radiometric measurements are slightly different, the last era here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He's younger than the Great Roudný (old than 3.3 million years old) and older than Venus volcano (aged 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born into explosions.
In addition, it produced a significant amount of volcanic ash along with the rocks of the rock from the substrate, which have become redished with brown paint.
At the end of this phase, it ran out onto the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous jaw up to 13 meters powerful.
The second erupt cast red, brown red, and places to blackTuffs.
Their layer is power up to 50 meters, and part of it is accessible in the bourgeois wall.
In the tuffes, there are striking volcanic pumps of up to 1 metre, and the second era was ended by the outpouring of the lion.
At the end of the volcano activity, avalanche leaked out, which today consists of up to 50 m thick layer of slag jaw.
The juices in which a volcanic ash is used are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name of the stratovine.
The original volcanic cone was subject to a gradual erosion.
But he was threatened by the heavy rock in a bed on the south side.
The most intense mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Fats were added to concrete, which was later lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The challenge was achieved by the pressure of experts and the public to stop this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the mines, which quickly radiate, fall apart and fall down at the slope of the mountain.
Lom's missing so fast.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, it is a warm, south-oriented slope ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
The preparation is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is not new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
On the U.S. top you will get on a green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Slezské Kočova.
Automobiles can use an unpaid parking lot at the start of the video alley, where even a short learning trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent more of her life in an active villa with garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa quarters in Orechovec.
The original owners of the house, of course, got it back in the restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small distance.
Ivana therefore quickly sought a replacement for herself and her older mother.
From the friends got a tip on an apartment of 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the view from the fourth floor on an extensive forest park and the dam pushed me to the other side," remembers Ivan's first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year commission.
"There are more than 13 years of living here today and not only because of gradual reconstruction I wouldn't change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter were then moved from a hundred-meter apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and progressive arrangements lasted for almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but it had to make necessary adjustments, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner tossed the core, but the owner was most concerned with the unpractically-resolved and uselessly large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms resulted in a multifunctional living space.
The architects used to define individual zones and to split the castorton room, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to remove in the living room after a few years.
This apartment has changed to 2+ kk, but the room has gained air force and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivan's bathroom didn't know how to handle it.
For years, I've been collecting magazines about living and searching for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I addressed the young architect Kamila Doudir on the recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," said Ivana.
Thanks to the remodeling of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available halls.
The architect connected the space of the toilet and the bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one slide, saving the place.
The bathroom is timeless and is also wheelchair-free enough.
The high-quality covers imitating sandstones, in the shower there is an extra comfortable seat, a bidet shower at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudir continued.
As the dream was built, it was a quick but crucial change in the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeník.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping into the space, which was created by a combination of two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical separation, the purchase of semi-precious or Japanese walls.
"This would in the end violate the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
We managed to originally separate the sleeping and the living area.
It was enough to turn two sofas back on each other, and between them to build a small locker on the feathers.
The dining area defines the shades of floors and paints.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high quality marble, the sliding door brought back a wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, cover the sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor from antiallergy marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous one from the laminate: soft and loose surface without spray and better sound insulation.
The system of clippings and views from the guttercarton highlighted by the color is a demonstration of how it can be worked with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like oranges, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The basking with the motif of the blooming magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which undermined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, into the space under the window sills.
It's all in range, the lights are comfortable remote-controlled.
The new contrast with the older ones works perfectly in the oversized interior, for example with dozens of years of old crystal mirror and high quality artistic objects Ivana collects her entire life.
Last one came the kitchen.
The blocks were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a little bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and moved their location.
The furniture in a simple design is made on a custom, white area softens a slightly pearly surface.
In a small space, the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher have come in thanks to the creative solution.
In view of the small kitchen, a whole-coloured wall over the work desk was restored.
The unique graphite with digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition to maintaining perfectly.
Ivana chose the magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems satisfied here too.
There was a small bath in the original bathroom and a washbasin, the new owner chose the neutral shade of the cover.
The big shower corner has a ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment in which the functions and facilities would be in harmony.
We are materially and colourfully united and tried to make his elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition was a barrier-free solution with minimum obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and reachability of objects of daily needs," adds Kamila Doudirová.
The Supreme Court has decided: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has decided that former Prime Minister Petra Nečas can also be prosecuted for any criminal acts he could commit before the House of Deployment in August.
It was protected by a procedural immunity that relates to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS members Ivan Fuksi, Mark Šnajdra and Petra Tluchora, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until last November, Peter Knötig said the spokesperson of the Supreme Court.
The Court of First Instance rejected the proposal from the State representative of Iva Ištvan, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with the Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the approval of laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts can continue to be prosecuted.
Also, the anti-corruption officer was arrested with you, Mr. Bart.
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him also in a case of alleged corruption of VV Members, also did not want to express himself too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client and this matter, but I cannot comment on this in view of the protection of classified facts."
According to information of the Rights of the case, the General Inspection of the Security Councils (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that Bart was allowed to buy classified information from the police.
According to the server, the first repair.cz case may have been related to the case of former President Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Bárt was allegedly sought.
However, last information on the rights shows that the detention of Vita Bárty with Petr Lessy is not related.
The spokesperson of the presidium, Eva Kropáčová, refused to comment on the fact that the case is being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesperson of the Municipal Prosecutor in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
In this case, the plaintiff Bártov is in charge of the matter, and, from its words, it is not directly indicated that the file or criminal proceedings are being carried out in the covert regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vita Bárty Kateřina Classic in the morning before their residence in Klárov, Prague.
She just put the bags in her car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bártov was arrested by the leader of the St. Tosvit Tomio Okamura movement.
According to his words, he has no idea what's going on in bail.
"Vit Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn direct democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
In recent early elections to Sněmovna in the Plzeňský Region, Vit Bárt was unable to run for the movement of Úsvit direct democracy Tomia Okamura, known for his corrupt bail in the execution of public affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with deferral for 30 months.
Then the judgment was changed, and Bart was dismissed by the prosecution.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have pride, lust, and enthusiasm
For Prospala, family was always in the first place, which is why she wants to be fully subordinated in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's gonna extend his career, or he's gonna end up with a hockey game.
"I want to perform the role of my dad and my husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who's still waiting for the offer in vain.
Even though he's an eloquent worker who'll never get away with anything.
Despite leaving his heart on ice every time, and he can take down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player in the past season of Columbia.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," reports determined.
Perhaps he will wait, allegedly New York Rangers, who have failed to enter the season and have two wounded resistances - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
What does it look like when you come to Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have something on my paper, it's no use to deal with it.
I know an article came out in New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been delivered that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where it's about to get into a situation where that contract really comes in.
When the player gets hurt, or it doesn't work, and the manchaft doesn't work.
There are a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get this contract.
But in New York, that's what happens, isn't it?
The wounded is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The other thing is, you always need two sides for it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
That's unfortunately the reality that I have to live in.
You're leaving for America on Friday, you're expecting something to go down?
I've had those expectations since July 5, when the NHL opened up a free player market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you have a programme planned?
It is given by being a father and a husband, and it's everything that's going on.
I'm no hockey player right now. I don't have a deal and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do my dad's and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sunday, yours has two hockey matches, that's my whole family's holiday for me, if we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time wheelchairs?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
Even this could happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I've had a lot of fun.
One day it's going to get to a stage like this, that all goals, victories, and gifts won't replace what you've got at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Have your job as much as you want.
I've had a job that was the most beautiful thing I've ever met besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, first place - except for family - is also a sport success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
That's what family lives are for.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - mine and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd love for them to continue this trend.
Because what we're gonna say is, in America, there's options everywhere.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you're planning on staying in America forever?
We'll practice it as we have been.
This means that in summer we will be in Bohemia in Hluboká and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've had great luck in my life.
It can be said that I went across the street, it cost a lot of power and abstinence, and it took a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose with a woman where we live.
There are a lot of people around the world who want to choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long are you going to have the will to work, train hard and wait for the offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have at NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay.
There's no plan.
So you can say you're gonna wait for this season to work out, and then you're gonna decide what next?
I'm in the middle of the day.
Recently, the director-general of ČEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of the Temelín power plant was postponed at the end of 2014 and 2015.
He justified it by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and by agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the Government.
With these reasons, ČEZ is attempting to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, qualified managers should give recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind them.
I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to agree that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go directly to the government to create any at all.
The President of ANO admitted that in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.

Police evacuated for shooting a part of Los Angeles airport
International airport in Los Angeles fired in the morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport because of that, reportedly it was a terminal three.
Agent Reuters, with appeal to California's media, claims the law enforcement men shot a gun with a gun.
Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said there was a shootout in which two or three members of the Security Administration were injured.
How many people have been injured and if there are victims but are still not obvious.
Fireman's talking about an event with more wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israel's military planes bombed the military base near the port of Latakija on Thursday.
With the appeal to the U.S. government's name, it was announced by CNN.
The Israeli press reported an explosion in the alleged missile warehouse widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli army spokesperson on the question of the CNN refused to comment on the raid.
"We're not speaking to foreign media reports," she said.
According to the US government’s air force, Israel’s view was that they could be transported to Hizballah’s militant Lebanese movement.
AP with appeal to another US security agent informed that the target of Israel’s attack on the Syrian territory was Russian missiles SA-125.
The second channel of Israel’s television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the area of attack, but according to the DPA agency, have shown the battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Nova.
In addition, they were told to see the batteries of the SA-3 rocket, including the command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
The missiles recorded show that Israel’s television is 35 kilometers [35 km] long and could carry a 70 kg weight head.
Israel has already bombed at least twice this year the supply of missiles inside Syria, said CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would affect any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Does Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company updated the estimate of the annual profit and expects record profits from recreation in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel agency is now expecting its annual basic profit before tax to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent 12 to 17 percent increase in relation to the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight percent profit in the first half, and the second half began to grow mainly in Australian and British travel outside the business trip.
"On today's date, our 10 profitable countries are and several are heading towards record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is where Australia and Great Britain belong, which is traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Business with recreational activities has increased during the second half of Australia, which compensates slightly for the weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain Flight Centre was well in recreational areas, while business clients spent less.
The American trade recovered after the loss during the season’s weaker half and is expected to bring a year’s profit for the third time.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to St Petersburg
Ecological activists detained since September in Russia due to protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
Today, AFP reported on this to the international environmental organisation of Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of her activists from the piratery have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after a non-violent action against oil platform in the Arctic, were transported from the repair facility in Murmansk to the penitentiary in St Petersburg," said the organization in the statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are not clear; according to DPA, it was a planned transfer.
Ecology authorities first accused them of piracy, for which, in the event of condemnation, they threatened to be in prison for up to 15 years.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would replace a milder disorder for which a lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years is being put to rest.
But in today's statement, Greenpeace pointed out that the authorities' charges of piracy have not yet been withdrawn, as they promised.
That means the detention is now charged with two crimes.
The powerful investigation committee announced last week that the charges of piracy will be replaced by a charge of fraud.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not withdrawn.
Instead, a new accusation was raised against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace's statement.
In the middle of September, the Russians kept three dozens of Greenpeace movement members from 18 countries on the oil platform.
The ecologists were on a ship named Arctic Sunrise, who sailed under a Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, which although they have appealed against, the court has rejected them all.
They complain about conditions of imprisonment.
According to AFP, the Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the new prison conditions will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he warned.
She asked Dutch King Willem-Aleksandra to help her, one of Faiz Oulahsen's arrested activists.
In a hand written letter that today published a letter by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called for him to discuss their situation during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that the Málika has a large share in the recovery of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said in part also to fights in the neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the English literature hours, at least one Shakespeare game, the 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914 will have to be studied.
The test will also include a “covered text” in order to encourage deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a graduation exam from their tongue, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should tomorrow issue new curriculums for English and mathematics – the first items to be completed by radical change.
For other essential subjects, the changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, who oversees the exams, reveals changes in the structure of the exams, together with a new recognition system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our trial system to regain confidence in society” and that it is necessary to insist that the prominence test be“ more demanding, ambitious and tougher”.
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics is averaged 143 hours per year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition sources have said that an extensive graduation exam from mathematics – together with greater emphasis on this subject in the resulting ladders – they will probably encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The teaching plan will focus more on real world “problems”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD isn't me
Before the elections, the long-swing dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence of the inside of the Ostravska ČSSD was set on fire.
It all worked out when Mayor Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned to court for the non-democratic assembly of candidates.
Even though the cauzy activists did not want to express themselves too much to the party before the elections, they would not harm the party even more.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
So, as soon as Monday evening, head of the obstravska ČSSD called on Mayor Ostrava to step out, and he will probably push even to lose his function.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in disputes, and whoever's on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Dennik.
How do you see the election result?
The ČSSD has definitely counted with a much better result.
Did she get hurt by the fact that there were disputes inside the media before the elections?
I imagine social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it's consistent with the state in which ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
I think I've been going through ODS for a while, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, powerful people who had previously expected to find their prebends at ODS, have moved to people in ČSSD and influenced them.
It is then related to the fact that police are walking around the Ostraska Magistrate offices and collecting computers.
This shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who would want the good of everyone else, but many of them are primarily thinking about their own well-being.
ČSSD is divided into two immemorial camps in Prague as it is seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
It's been a long time, though.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a forefront of what was happening now in Prague.
Haškov's wing gradually cast positions so that after the elections it can cause a situation that weakens Sobotkov's wing.
One is in politics in a situation where compromises sometimes need to be reached.
But everyone has some internal border, where the compromises no longer go, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaralk that I would try to get on a regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkov's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
But it's got a lead on the Hashev wing.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Sobotka's story is, I think, a person who always talks mainly about the ČSSD program and to some extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the views of the parties.
I think Michal Hašek has now put an end to his political career in Prague.
How did you know that the ČSSD security management did not approve of you for the candidate?
The political parties are based on a competition that puts itself in place by their members.
This competition should be based on programme visions and on the ability of these people to fulfill these visions.
But, of course, there are also people who do not have the powers or vision in this competition, but the political party is an elevator for them for money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people begin to get to the front because they break the rules without scrimping, they break the sides.
In my opinion, they do their best to the political parties of the mafia, and I believe that they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
This problem is more important to me than to take account of whether Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the views.
Is that why you applied before the elections to the court for preliminary action against the form of a candidate in the Moravskoslez region?
The current interim executive committee in Ostrava strengthens its power by the fact that organisations that do not comply with it can cancel, set up new organisations for purpose, gradually reject uncomfortable members of the party.
For example, they also wanted to exclude Richard Bednarík from the representative's club, but he filed an action against it, and they preferred to cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that, although it is the last possibility to be able to comply with the views of the parties, it is the only way that those other methods and the control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to work.
The attempt to lead the observatory ČSSD in front of Member Adam Rykalou is to call you off the Mayor's position.
It's a public secret that this post has the focus of Mayor Poruby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those voices they hold up their power on the side.
When I get back to the past, all that could have happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Basel stadium was an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged to mark me as a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that has strategically great value for it.
So, how do you see this going with your behavior in the primer's function?
The Periodic Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our ongoing behaviour in the ČSSD.
But I think it's as if a thief screams, "Take a thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in the Ostrava social democracy who is initiating and promoting, sometimes against the members of the party, the emergence of so many development things, such as an industrial zone or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any differently than I'm preventing others to go through the places they want.
Will you fight against these efforts?
Because if this Republic is to work well, then it has to work well for political parties.
I can hardly believe that any side will be able to drive the state effectively when it can't drive even by itself.
So I don't think I'd be leaving ČSSD now because I think that whoever's causing this side cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me out.
Olomouc opens in the historical centre of the public rink
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spalý said that the preparatory work at the rink was launched on 26 October and from the center is in operation aggregate for ice production.
The ice layer is already strong seven inches and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The bathroom has a area of 375 square meters, the platform took 358 square meters.
The Bruslers and the passers will also have two poachers.
"We extended the floor area, increased the space before the stand and almost the whole area of the subway is covered so that the skaters can easily move," he described Burn.
Olomouc Street is already reminiscing Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall in Horní náměstí.
The repair of the Lower Square has been completed for years, so the ice area could have returned to its original location.
For the first time, people were able to fight directly before the Council in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will start a month before Christmas.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlínsk will renegotiate the regional court
The Regional Court has dismissed the charges of 25-year-old Slovák and twenty-five-year-old Bohemia for lack of evidence.
The men have denied the blame.
They're in danger of 15 to 20 years of prison or an exceptional punishment.
The spokesperson, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the Court of First Instance had withdrawn the regional decision and returned the matter to him again.
The reasons the judge had led to this have refused to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, seventy-year-olds were attacked by a man in his house.
Senior died of a tragic death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beat him, and kicked him all over the body and metal, apparently a gas gun, and put about three dozens of wounds in the head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he found at the site.
The youths reportedly took about 3000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14 thousand crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, in addition to indirect evidence against the defendant’s smell marks, the expert assessed as not fully identified in the meaning of legal guidelines.
Both the smell marks from the crime scene and other things were in more than ten cases consistent with the defendants, but the police initially treated them as material and not smell marks.
Plus, there was some doubt in handling them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants without doubt has not been demonstrated.
The court, however, recognised that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he'd apparently fallen and hurt himself.
Even the emergency services doctor has not alerted violent deaths.
Criminals contacted some of the days after a few of them, some of the Olomonic doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the postmortem.
The police couldn't work with all the leads from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants found on the scene.
Young Slovák lived on the Uherskohrady.
He is now serving a penalty of 8.5 years, which last year confirmed to him by the powerful Olympic Supreme Court.
The man, according to him, was the head of an organized group of six youngsters, who had a robbery robbery against goldmaking.
The armpits became in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Younger of the accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts with the reconstruction of the herd
In early November, Znojmo will start reconstruction of the football stage.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who were doing the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the urban stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages so that it meets the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close by the week of String of autumn
The saxophone great man and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the following dot next Wednesday at the 18th edition of the autumn String Festival.
Shorter will be released on November 6 in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia, led by Martin Kumžák, will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter adjustments for symphonic orchestra the composition of Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also shows that the Prague concert in the Falls will launch his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world more than 60 years ago.
The reading of the interpreters he worked with is from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Jon Mitchell, to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Viennese liner Joe Zowil, with whom in legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they used the direction of a new fusion style.
For the past 13 years, Wayne Shorter Quarter has been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quarter.
Some postparty after the festival will still be Spotlight's club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to Andrey Triany's charismatic singers, the national audience will present the Manchester Trio Go Penguin with its jazz-based electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the Profound Bass electro-jazz form inspired by dance styles.
Women say that UEFA is forbidden to publish penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, Chairman of the Board of Judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has ceased to publish penalties for the judges.
It prohibits UEFA's rules, which she said in her interview for the Lawlist.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be threatened.
Damková also refused to party to Plzna footballers in her function.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the Commission are taken from Prague, for example.
So in the event of a vote I may lose 1:6," said Damková in response to criticism, which started after Plzeň played twice as much penalts as other league teams recently.
Thus, although the FAČR has ceased to publish punishments for the referee in recent months, Damková assures that the droughts are paying for their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, he would have limited the delegates, whatever the game was," Damek said.
The reason why punishments are not published is a ban on the European football union.
"EUFA's disclosure of such information forbids and violates the criminal offence seriously."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I got two very strong warnings that if we don't stop it, they're going to be severe sanctions," Damek said.
Other countries respect ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continued, the Commission said that it would lose money from the UEFA to the education and development of judges.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not complete the program on the education of referees," Damek added.
Bárty's arrest is related to Janoušk and Béem: Is it behind the escape of the wires?
The President of the Public Affairs of Vita Bárt arrested the police on Thursday.
Along with him he was arrested by the Head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics of the Anticorruption Police Jan Petržilek.
The detention is related to the listeners of Roman Janouš and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
News.cz server has confirmed the Czech Press Office's trusted source.
The phone calls received by Janusek and Béma last March, published by the newspaper Young Front Today, both men calling each other "Mazanek" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušk's influence on the city's steps under Bem's leadership.
The daily stated that in 2007 the security information service (BIS) was provided by the security agency (ABL) two years later.
That's when Bárt owned it.
Server News.cz pointed out that the detained criminalist Petržilek was working before he joined the anti-corruption police just for BIS.
At the same time as they were published, Petržilek moved to the anti-corruption department.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said the prosecutor Michal Moravský of the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm even that he was monitoring bail.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies from ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies from 10 have been preparing intensively for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and Trade Corporation Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company’s representatives asked said that the issues involved with the two key codes in their company were not addressed at all.
This comes from the investigation of Ambrus & Dark Deloitte Legal law office, which found out the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the upcoming date of effectiveness of the two key codes, only at the last minute a number of managers are beginning to realize what their companies can have a significant impact on business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, be affected by all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The industry has lived in a long time in uncertainty as to whether or not the revolutionary changes will eventually occur.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to move to new law for their companies without complications," comments Ambrus & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of 61 percent of companies engaged in the new legislation, 26 percent indicated that their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of companies from this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, each fifth company has not yet dealt with, yet has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent of the opinion and the issue cannot be assessed.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they haven't dealt with re-codification issues yet.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the closing of new contracts (21 percent), following solutions of business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the real estate catastra and in liability (by 10 percent).
One of the most important new texts of the entire recode is to unite the contract only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both civil and commercial law will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become more transparent for both citizens and business.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new design will offer a lot of news with emphasis on the greater freedom to organise relations," said the lawyer Ambrutz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddane.
In connection with the corporate law, nearly a quarter of the company considers it the most important topic to increase the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
They follow the themes of the changes in the call and the process of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening up duties and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, in particular in a situation where companies are at risk of falling or falling into it.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board of directors and members of companies do not deal with the care of a proper economy and do not reverse the threatening collapse of society, they may lose their benefits for the performance of the function in the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier style develop as a live language
My task is to maintain a tradition while leading our brand to modern things, not to remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview for HN its position Pierre Rainero, the director of style in Cartier.
This French luxury house was established in 1847.
It goes through the mud, the river and the jungle and provides free medical attention
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical attention at villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team save nearly every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN hero award.
You can vote for him or for any of the 10 main candidates in the 2013 CNN Heroes Prize.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle has been watching his father again and again falling into unconsciousness and driving to hospitals that have not been equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
He first treated only with a broken hand, but then there developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there created hematomas who had caused problems for his entire life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had money for that.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to a crowded clinic and hospitals where he received such a treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not.
There's a lot of patients in there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparisons, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if doctors can visit, many people can't afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the spending on health care in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers performed free 700 operations last year.
He became a medical surgeon in a central hospital in Yaunde himself.
And he founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical attention.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people in the supply, attach to the roofs of medical needs and travel through a rough terrain to the villages that need help.
They're not always lucky.
Sometimes the vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing, and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical treatment for free is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unscrupulous energy – is very willing to join in the local cheers.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwell.
They come to the village from a distance of 60 kilometres, and that walk.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many treat with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gifted glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that requires school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing simple operations under local narcissism.
The surgery is usually done in the school building, in the city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating rooms and hygiene equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers work in early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose its motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of camera doctors and foreign students of medicine – carried out 700 operations for free last year and realizes that their assistance can mean a lot for local residents.
One man said that after the procedure, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and working surgeons at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private health clinics around Yaunde at night.
He says that this second job is financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and nursing services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle's mission, this is a great practice they would not get at home.
“Doctor Bwelle and we washed our hands thoroughly and removed blood stains, or we kept the tools,” says O’Malley.
It's like a medical student in the second year in America that you'll never live.
Students usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often come with their medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive at Yaunde, food, transportation and study, Bwelle provides them.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwell, the constant agony is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise that he gave his father is something that brings great joy to him.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwell.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at ASCOVIME's website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát restored his position as Main Sisters for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of the nurses, whose number exceeds 100,000 in the Czech Republic.
"I consider it essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalised in order to have a nurse's representative within the structure of the Office, a representative to whom Martin Holcát, Minister of Health, may always address if necessary.
I appreciate the work of my sister, and I think the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
It is necessary not only for high professional professionalism, but also for human access and personal convictions to carry out this profession.
"Rade and all responsibility, I'll try to enforce those steps that can improve the position of the nurses."
"We have excellent and clever sisters in our health care, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who, through their approach to patients, do not help us to perform their calling with all empathy and help us improve the image of our sister in public," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed main nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated that she wanted to deal with the various aspects of the position of the medical nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educated people, other non-health professions and doctors.
"I don't necessarily want to separate the professions of doctors and sisters, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, having all my competences and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a completed work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the work of a sister, I see these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, simplification of health care and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative acts of the sisters make it unnecessary for them to take time that they might and should give to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Further areas to which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, looking for better mutual cooperation in the team and managing healthcare providers, adapting competence and working issues, such as respecting the labour law or not overloading the sister's sisters with insufficient numbers at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steaks, which are not documented on a specific case where the rules could be infringed.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of the maintenance of anonymity such a complaint and the specific case of having the competent authorities checked," concluded Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Central Medical School in Health Care (in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the Researcher's Study Program – pedagogy (in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the Head of the Department of Health and Other Non-Scientific Affairs and Recognition of Qualifications in the Education and Science Department.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at her bed at the internal department, she continued to serve as a teacher at the Central Medical School, where she was also 8 years of the Statutory Assistant Director.
From 2004 to 2009 she acted as head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several specialist textbooks for nursery and articles in professional journals, dedicated to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't get caught up in hate ♪
The Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After years of reading, he lived, but did not write, he published VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new novel by Wind, dark, present.
That it is not a close union, the number of pages comparable to its most famous work by Housian (Perrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn't shut up with hate.
Seeing around all the time new and new clones of this human foolish littleness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't even talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lusts, inexhaustible souls and opalized ideologists who try to sell their 'product with the expression of little sales whores'.
At the beginning of the century, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juror friends, weirdoes, and hidden formations.
I've missed it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burn out of my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books at the light of the night.
You're talking about a feeling of death, hate.
There was some kind of fracture in the past that influenced you, or you're just getting older, like all of us?
Evil was a long time ago, about ten years ago.
That's when it didn't have a name.
Well, that's what I've been living for.
There's still a quiet boy somewhere inside.
I see another lonely little bitch, everybody in their own little bag of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I'm participating in this vast, thousands of years of life system movement on this planet - the disintegrating of the incomprehensible future.
This enormous, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the temptation-omyl creates another and another generation of beings that create some superhuman, artistic intelligence in billions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self-deceased, or better said dialogue that leads right and left half the brain, sometimes sails to a level and forms into a book.
Like a period of peace, it is covered by quiet metastases of wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I don't do anything, then one day I'll be quiet.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays them down in layers that are stored in darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Neokortex, gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient airtight of the brain tree.
He speaks to the hairless beasts, asks the snakes, looking for an answer in the flight birds, raising his sight to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
Finally, the brain is asking the world.
relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all memories, experiences and experiences that man has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its discerning, cognitive process, being exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unscrupulous effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload disorders arise.
Analogically - as if you "slip" PC, from the program of speech emulator and translators from foreign languages, you would get wet first in the operational environment, such as Windows, and after several failed restarts ended up in a dark green surrounding Bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on a motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who haven't understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psychospirity crisis.
You mention her often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In so far the functional mechanisms of our thinking, compassion and behavior - there is a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche, "So long he looked into the abyss when the abyss looked into him."
The risk of - a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "death" and new quality comes in.
And why am I interested in that personally?
I will answer the illustration.
Once one fell into twilights and topped, ran days, months and years, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a diver.
I hope some of the words written by me once helped Hrabal's texts.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one you can't say anything meaningful about, one called it consciousness, the next super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader participates directly in the process of word formulation and sentence."
From the early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nem, running in the dark streets.
In the end, following all of this branching of the authors and their messages, it reads, "The sun of the bright worlds of other Karl Hynka Mácha".
And when the book is outside?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
In retro-reflection, who gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, after years, they accidentally contact me in the street and thank me for helping them with my book in their hard life decision.
The books are in fact "life" or better said "worlds".
They're coded in letters, they're carrying experience, the history of the regions of the language.
Any time we can wake them up to life when we let their sentences flow to their brains.
It's actually, in its own way, something forbidden by divine - to awaken other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is placed in a enchant - according to the old demonological books, we're getting into witchcraft.
After the book was released, as it happens, there's a chain of author's reading waiting.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to get back into it with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather tell you today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people all over the place.
Their basic character - they're inconceivable, they don't pay attention to each other, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel alone with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec there was a living (and I hope that there is still one knit bookseller (the name is called a random July), a happy friend and a good girl bull.
At one drink, he introduced me to individual articles of readers of my book Housian.
I looked in their eyes, and then I was shown to be a large, read copy of my book.
In despair, I'd put down a deciphered liver and cry briefly.
We all stood there in the milk, snooped and drunk with the milking of tears.
Then that young blond bowl didn't stand up, and he jumped his head out of the window into a snowy curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the nightland and the slaughtering of a happy rage of sensitive, painful souls of landscapers and steaks of fallen patriots - went out and moved like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text of Wind, dark, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian woman in the mouth of the people: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
It's a dog. It's a gray chest.
Horrible, horrific, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell a long time ago, and we have been drawing - what role on this country we will play.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you gonna let that influx again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamened, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depths and in such a width that completely exceeds our horizon - and so we are doing exactly in the intensity of our programmed assignment.
We are remunerated by the flow of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to burn, we die in defense and get new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we'll show compassion.
That's the only time we have a right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious, and the precious sails made from the dirty pocket catch the influx of the bottled wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After the critique wave, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of notices of notices of notices from the Republican providers in recent days, the president has accused the US public of deceptive.
Obama slipped away from his original promise yesterday.
“The large majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the media’s “discipline” about the answers, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care programme at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act for Access.
"I tell these Americans to be honest: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Act on Available Care, said that the launch of the internet market had gone "wrongly" since October.
"I am disappointed and upset like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sebelius, a subject he caught on the microphone yesterday, said to the consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who concerned whether or not she had to participate in Obama's care program itself.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Act on Available Care did not voluntarily give up a government-sponsored insurance, and he did not purchase a programme through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which millionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed and according to various sources from the agency and behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the auction starts, for the LTE network, before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG Group.
The one with the brand Sakzka Telecommunications released a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And that's to a general surprise, until then, the taste of the company was not talked to the telecommunications company.
But Sashko's running a very experienced telecommunication masquerade Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the director of Slovak T-Mobil and last time was the head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The jacket's playing a couple of cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to run a virtual with Vodafon.
And it gives logic.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
That may not be liked under normal circumstances, but according to the information provided by the Business News, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between competition operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If this will succeed on the LTE network (as a novice can auction a specially designed spectrum), so Vodafone will not need to leave at all in the auction, or he will not mind the extraction of only a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone and Sazka can share the network.
Vodafone lets Sakko go to his 2G/3G network (respecting the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network fast.
The stake between this will begin to build a expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money provided would then spend Vodafone on a hard internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would purchase Czech and Slovak O2 (Sloven branch is the daughter of the Czech Republic) to receive immediately a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big pier waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, LTE would have already won Kellner for O2 and very probably in synergies with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that the networks would share.
The auction could finally end with a success, but probably not enough with high amounts, which are looking forward to the state budget.
And since next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárka.
Or two Titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be around without signatures?
President Zeman's era has progressed into a legendary stage with an ashtray, and so it is not hard to listen to complaints that collect evidence of the reincarnation of the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Hardík has not been documented, let alone to sign.
True, led by editors.
However, the cases described do not give an answer to the question of where such a favor is taken by some journalists to the zemans - whether it is a reaction to direct order or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of immpatic integrity.
And since we are assuming general destruction, it is not possible to forgive the question of whether the changes in the ratios in television do not seek any other, least inclusive power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is, those who say that there is no attempt to intervene politicians in developed countries.
The truth is, however, that does not mean that there are no complaints against public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the other hand, they criticise primarily what they consider to be a tendency which is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't matured into this civilization stage, and this situation isn't there.
But it may also be in a country that thinks it is the most common in the world, black and white stories about bad police and good journalists spend more comfortable than complicated descriptions of an inconspicuous situation in which many imperfect human beings are affected.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the edge of the forces
It is almost a rule that in key countries the head of the state was not in such a form as to enable it to fulfil its duties.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived a little differently at the end of his presidential period and events around Munich.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after the symbolic resistance, the air force could fly abroad, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight against their legitimacy in place.
And most importantly, it shouldn't be a hangover nation till today.
Beneš was not a U.S. statesman, and in Munich he was still in shape, but during the war, he was already out of the hill and in February 48 he behaved according to it.
To be better off about it, he could've left for exile for the third time, and he could've broken down the legitimacy of the communists and their knocks.
It's a shame to talk about Hech.
He was elected to be "Mr. President not in a position to decide".
But he had to, even though he had to make a big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office, it probably wasn't.
In the last days of March 1939, Franz Moravec said what should be done to ensure that the occupation he knew for the day was not so smooth and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government didn't do anything, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human wreckage of Gottwald had his airships executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Louis Svoboda has definitely prevented participation in normalization and had to settle it, completely senile.
That Husák was helpless and sick depressed old man events in November 89 had made it easier, but that's the only thing.
Havel was lucky not to meet him at the office for the last few years, and he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pension, but many of his activities indicate that mental processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's what we've got.
The head of the state and the commander of the armed forces look like they're looking, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no risk of external threats to the Republic right now.
Or maybe it's in danger, just not so visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (in historical terms) well that the President is not entirely at strength.
It's not normal.
Couldn't we be choosing the President in this country again once again someone acceptable and acceptable?
Faraway planets, black and white movies or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw out an icebyle.
In the concept of his quartet, which on 6 November in the great hall of Prague Lucerny will end this year's String of autumn festival, everything is related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's jazz saxophones are the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they're experiencing right now.
They approach music as completely improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, of course, is a fresh eighty-year-old Shorter – an extraordinary composer, wearer of nine Grammy, former fellow player Miles Davis, and today probably the biggest living jazz saxophonist - is not happy to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that the best thing is to be surprised by life.
"Though a lot of people are planning everything, and then they're disappointed when things get different," says Shorter.
How the insects from Thailand lifted the sales of the Paris bar
Maybe you're snooping around the insect, and you don't know you can eat it for half a kilo of a year.
For example, grounded in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you have a unique experience also taken care of.
He included the insect offering first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of Le Festin Nu bar.
Bar, for whose name it was inspired by the book William Burroughs Náhý lunch, you would find in fashion 18th district near Montmartru a generously visited tourist destination.
With fresh avocados, baked with red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, the guests are newly allowed to taste not only different larvas, herbs or water bugs, but also snorts.
Carefully and specially packed vans (to avoid damage to the insect’s wings, to their legs or to damage the eyes) to Daviron send all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris-based pioneering bar states a few reasons why we should consume insects.
The first is ecological benefits because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (which is financed, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"The insect is an excellent source of protein and the omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the Reuters station.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant pleasure, the sense of sin and the atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just making a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably be overthinking how they consume a bug decorated with a dog, but the response of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects is very positive according to the owner.
Even the skeptics will finally taste it, even if they begin with the smallest bites and when they finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Businessmen in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech Construction has been facing a continuous decrease in the volume of contracts and not the State's interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The release of the new green savings was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
There is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, will provide considerable amounts for heating, but also for the chances of construction companies and building materials producers.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2700 new jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are important, and this is also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the union of entrepreneurs in construction in the Czech Republic does not strongly agree with the Government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps, which would allow the continuation of the programme to be further put forward in order to put forward further challenges within its framework.
Pravao, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president buried and ended up in crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motholic hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed, and left for a castle in Lánech.
What's his condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that the American spy "was gone too far"
John Kerry indicated that the U.S. defense attitude regarding his surveillance programs and, in an unprecedented confession, said that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far”.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he was responsible with Barack Obama for the fact that, in view of the angry revelation of the NSA's spying activity, which appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowden, they acted as a "autopilot".
Public information caused diplomatic storms between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video-connection at the open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that were out of the frailness of the works because this possibility was, referring to World War II, difficult periods of Cold War and then of course September 11.”
So he became the first highly built member of the U.S. government to admit that the American spying crossed the border, but stressed that none of the rights were violated.
He said, “In some cases, it has gone too far.”
And the President is determined to try to explain it to people and to make it clear, and he is already doing a thorough examination, so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA was seeking good and that its tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world where people are willing to set themselves off. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
What if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the aircraft from falling, the buildings didn't explode and the people were not executed because we can learn about these plans forward.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate of European Affairs said that American legislators are preparing for Europe to respond to foreign concerns related to alleged US spying, and convinced Europeans that there is a need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other people and that he is worried about their threats to stopping participation in counter-terrorism organizations because they are disillusioned by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is indeed important for Europe to remain on one ship with us, taking into account joint efforts to combat terrorism, in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate's sub-optimal foreign relations for European affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism regardless of their rage over NSA programs.
News in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, disrupted relations with some American allies, although the Head of the Agency said this week that they were inconspicuous and reflected the misunderstandings of metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted the documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA followed the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others to 34 world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper of the Allied Consequence was defending as necessary and said it was a common matter of both sides.
In the middle of the convulsions Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary journey to take place this year, and he hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators who intend to engage are to be published in the coming days.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the journey was to help correct relationships, he added that “the well-defined measures will be prepared”.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that have been using themselves for years.
"As we adjust our monitoring programs to better protect European rights, they must also realize that we are not the only ones who carry out spying here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is heading this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to immortality, which has already triggered an American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as an American tracking activity.
Australanka appealed against a stay in Thai prison
One-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket island, when falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, called against a verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused of being arrested by the Earth court on Phuket Island of a false charge when the Thai police said that the taxi driver and two other men who had held her were attacked in the morning on Sunday 10 June.
However, the recordings from the industrial TV later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police have had interviews with Bamford two days before she realized she made up an accident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a prison in a repair facility with a low security guard at Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She's the daughter of the former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera.
Tunks said that Sunday Telegraph said that the whole family had “excessive fears” about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"Evidously this is a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 bags.
Australia reports that, in the meantime, she spent a holiday in the recreational area of Krabi in the south of Thailand.
Legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford represented a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a court proceedings which would increase her sentence and lead to a placement in prison for adults.
However, following the recent murder of the Australian travel agency Michelle Smith, in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a fucked-up picture for tourists, which may have just been behind an liberating verdict.
I'm just kidding, my brother's goal?
He got a puck in his defense zone and no one caught him anymore.
Plus, the leak turned into a quick forhend stick.
Jaromír Jágr scored this way against Tampa at night on Wednesday, on Thursday night 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After looking at this video with my agent Petr Svoboda, the director of the Czech Dragons called him and asked him if I should be interested in making a commercial for their most modern train Pendolino!" wrote on the introduction with Jágr.
I hear we're typically very similar.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit night practice so I can't make it any faster.
"I fear that the Minister of Defense might then be able to hear from him and would like to do an ad on the jet!" he added to the smiley.
New Jersey added a second victory in a row.
"In particular, you noticed - Mary Rottre's treatment works," Jágr closed.
Place of office of the candle-sealing pancake
October elections rather than winners have brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. the EAGC), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and ultimately also because of their inner breakdown.
The politicians served us instead of the holiday candles on the weekend of the election stew.
Andrej Babiš's movement, which promised the voters to change the current political style of governance, became a kickout.
The disillusionment of the electoral result and the dissolution in the winning party is a political (of) will of President Miloš Zeman, irrespective of the wishes of the voters who publicly supported President Zeman, they did not even vote in the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president lost a strategic lead in front of other politicians because of an unpleasant event, there are several other ways to get him back - such as choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting a prime chair in my eyes are being relinquished, the entrepreneurs of Andreju Babiš are coming closer.
While the election development is still a mile short and smoothly formed stable government, compared to the electoral scenario of the ČSSD government supported by the communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only a better report.
Due to the loud resistance of ANO to join together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (total 111 Members).
Due to its decomposition in ČSSD, which has become an in read and weak parter in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite hoarding for ČSSD.
The Minorial Government of ČSSD, composed of "non-Seconds" in the Castle, probably will not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by unsatisfed ambitions of many Social Democrats that can lead sooner or later on to another generation on the side.
So I ask myself, "We will not succeed in the next early elections by our own way?"
Another election would already be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
The ČSSD plans to introduce sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of government banks have been hoped to be under the table.
On the contrary, the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, on promotion of business, on alternate fiscal policy (governmental deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, on the reduction of the lower VAT rate for the goods selected.
The third areas occur most in view of social policy and the size of the state.
The ANO now has the top, so the programme so far the most likely coalition ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning rather to the right.
Which from my point of view is a better result than a left-wing tax programme on everything that is still moving in the economy.
