Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The apparent weakening of both sides of the existing large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought, according to the first preliminary results, an early parliamentary election in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered severe losses where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is really shaking.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korean captain Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of the votes remains, however, against the last 2006 elections, spending 5,5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse was ÖVP, which loses 25.6 percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in the Austrian post-war history and especially for the people who have launched the early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP came out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in preference to the SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions, speculation about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and former vice-president, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers consider that this might happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Parties.
Such developments would probably facilitate the way towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral result, i.e. to restore the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) they received a preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ 11 percent of votes - but the social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the people agreed to the populist (then it was still uniform in 2005 from BZÖ) to the common government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
Evidently, Haider was betting on this development, which already stated that he was prepared to cooperate with any party and presupposes a return to Vienna's national policy.
The party of the Greens came to Parliament, but it was slightly lost and fell between Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly crossed the four percent line and failed to reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of unlawful collection of bugs could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said that in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherdji.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, there would have been some cooling," he noted after the meeting, which took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said that it may be difficult to interfere in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed and punished by a fine, the central government may act with the local government in Dargilling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison would be best according to Mukherdji to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then request bail and wait for the sentence for freedom, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself in the negotiations.
"It recommends a appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the defendant with "competent legal support" said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided to them by the Indian party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining best relationships with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," said Schwarzenberg.
The Czech Republic attaches great importance to Czech entomologists’ problems, as the Czech entomologists said, in front of its partner.
"We really consider it a deep mistake of being trapped and accused of these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian party a promise to deal with things has been avoided by the Minister.
"I have received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
The Czech Republic judges the fight for the seabed
There will be an electronic wall map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the ocean's blues.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it an adjacent seabed.
The area is big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuso, who belongs to the 30-member team of staff of the UN division on the affairs of the oceans and marine law.
His boss, director of division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, interprets him and adds sometimes.
There's a working emancipation and enthusiasm in here.
The sea bottom has not yet been covered by the famous world, rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, ore and other mineral ingredients, but also unknown living organisms that have the key to developing cancer medicine.
Area greater than land
Today, the coastal states have begun to apply for a new sub-sea area.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Monte Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of so-called continental walk, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it shall be entitled solely to all sources of the Continental Creature.
"In general, behind the continental walk, the part of the seabed has its own floor, and it lays its foundation, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It goes beyond the coastline, often beyond the border of the two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulk.
The request submitted by the countries to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the Continental Creature must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many cost-effective surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three other countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The World Voice has recently recorded a success in Australia, which, as the first, has spread its submarine held significantly.
But it also acquired New Zealand's seabed area, which the Commission granted him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in reconnaissance.
The profit that will be spent on the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, priceless.
Other Member States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified "the treaty of Monte Bay".
Where the continental walkout ends, the oceanbed area begins with a convention declared "a common heritage of mankind".
There is no state here anymore.
The right of mining in this area shall be granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"The seabed, but there is no Klondajk," says the director Mikulk in excess, saying that his "unitive areas are legally defined and contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
They are shared with other countries of the eastern block in the framework of the Common Organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was awarded in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors of several other countries, the status of the so-called "primary investor".
It is entitled to benefit in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaiian islands and Kiribati.
The investor of the explored area is much larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a long time gone, it's like a submarine Tater replica.
"It is there to benefit from a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer from Indakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Robert Sandev division brings one such action.
It reminds a small potato or, in a little fantasy, a fairy-tale sham that, according to legends, brought back Gold.
Germany’s special deployment units were in the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has asked the hostages to help in the crisis from Germany - experts have arrived.
When the situation occurred, special units were prepared, however, did not take place.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of 11 in Egypt of European tourists are gradually being taken.
According to the Department of Defence data, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the Ministry's statement, both the Federal Army experts and the German antiterrorist groups of GSG9, the Federal Police Air Force, the Federal Criminal Bureau, and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Services (Technisches Hilfswerk).
According to another message from Monday afternoon, both ministers did not need to be heard by the German forces, because the kidnappers had let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
According to the German Government, the aid offered by Egypt has been accepted as aid forces for the on-the-spot shares.
"Unfortunately," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and eight Egyptian guides to the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear at the last moment, as well as details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
They're already saved safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of release.
There is no information available in Berlin yet when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild" all five tourists should also take off with special forces one of the Airbus German air force and reach Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of America's Congress has usually put in a rescue package for financial markets worth $700 billion.
Index Dow Jones fell badly.
In proportion to 206 to 227 votes, the US House rejected the government rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and both sides' frontal policies, a program that should ease chaos on financial markets was not found most.
Dramatic events have been desperate to convince the supporters of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote, to give his consent, even though, as he expressed himself, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones Index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concerns that the state rescue package might fall.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index increased to fall again after the announcement of failure of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbines on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is to be approved.
Travel agents record rising numbers of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, during the next month's tour reservation, a significant turnover in winter seasons increased by even more than 30 percent in comparison to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains unfamiliar.
For the winter season reservation, travel agents recorded an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of last year, as the German travel union (Deutscher Reiserband, DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market survey, increased number of reservations are available for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the October DRV, the turnover was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The GfK numbers are the basis for these results, which evaluates the data on reservations from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interacts with the overall market.
To this end, the tour reservation that took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, road to the United States is mainly requested, said the DRV.
In these travels, the reserve increase is about one-third.
In addition, Germany has particularly requested the objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as domestic waters.
First of all organized tours are on course, said President of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure on energy and food, there is a cost of "for a customer with a reduced capacity than for individually organised holidays".
Laepple explained that money may, among other things, save consumers by using a discount for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so, compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will be recorded again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An additional repetitive pop, beer of tulle and prominent in crotch from well-known designers.
For the first time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Cronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she wears a cut to a degree.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is made of scondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes away from the beer meadow, and we're already being thrown by photographers, and the memory cards are hbitically filled - that flatters me, for I'm on Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can be friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort was rather limited.
But right after he arrived at Theresa knows everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone's wearing women's cut or leather pants; no one's looking sick or embarrassedly concerned - everything's normal.
The special views at the stand with bananas in chocolate just harvest my apron.
One Munich warns me that I mistook her, "On the left you're free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, married, widowed in the back."
Secretly, I'll throw the butter from the back left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much, and they're wearing simple stuffed hats with the words "It's wire to get dressed!" and they're cramming on the surrounding naked asses.
The young man with these flashing tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and Oktoberfest is here for the first time.
He seems "gorgeous", with an extended "oh".
That's what he tells me after he's had a drink.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage baskets.
So Bob is one of the accused "Wildbieslers" in Bavaria, as he says to people who are free to urinate in public.
The rest of the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., they're running around the area where Oktoberfest is held, by unfamiliar nurses who have to take care of the fearful drunks.
Medicalians always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors of beer meadows: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the sail of this protrusion coffin is not visible.
"It's the ones that can't go on," he calls me in response to my question by one of the medics and disappears in the crowd.
The police published the name of the victim's accident
A name of a three-year-old woman who died in the hospital after her car hit her in Essex.
The Shenfield Road accident in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road there.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, one-a-a-a-a-a-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of a carefree ride.
He's already released on the police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, European powers have longed for a deep footing in the Turkish lockdown.
On the east bank of Bospor, maybe only 20 steps in Asia are one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Rotterdam and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
Then you'll be told by the tourist guide.
The building sits round at the end of the platform with towers on each corner, at the sight of the unrecognition from some provincial German town hall.
Stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as a person gets inside a caged register, he can no longer doubt the size of a company whose westest gate was.
The stand in August 1908 opened a German consortium of Anatolia-Bagdad Corporations.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, aimed at the ambition of controlling the Middle East by means of this railway, which was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond to the territory that is today Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular forces.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by frozen borders of cold war, is gone
The British and colonial forces proceeded from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Bad news came also for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, he destroyed the storm train's elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it's sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually rocking, and history has been around it.
However, today, this gate to Anatolia and to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The governing party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I had a train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I should have met one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, the Turkish Member of Suat Kiniklioglu.
Next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a codecircular ride along the tracks that reminded the ancient rhythms of the famous documentary Night mail, I arrived at the Turkish metropole, designed as a new city for the secular state, who wants to turn his back on its Ommanian past.
However, the ACP and its well-known Islamic roots represent the shift of the paradigmat of Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicions in the west, especially in Washington.
Taxnik brought me to the capital of the ACP state, ultra-blue stone and metal building, deliberately built on the emerging suburbs, surrounded by half-extension business houses and trade shops to power where middle managers in trade suits - men and women - meet to do early morning shops.
Suat Kiniclioglu could be a central policy from almost every other European political party.
Sako, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its lockdown.
Today, they have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But I'm sure there will be a moment," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "he didn't wish that decision had to come to such a decision."
After that, he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here was said almost oblivion: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are as much for the benefit of Europe and the United States as for Turkey.
With Turkey aboard it seems that Europe as a whole can, as a metaphorically, travel on these tracks east to Asia and in the Middle East.
Back to the station, Hydarpasa, after another larger night, I thought of those two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who were watching this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting for the ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called "the helpless man of Europe".
So it appears that at least then there was no doubt that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorial lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes in : As a Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (neklog, September 11th) was responsible for Guildford's Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
As part of the periodic musical plan, he founded a year for this excellent congregation of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but at the time when Proteus was last singing in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape converter) represented the willingness and the ability of the congregation to go to any music that was submitted to him - either the madrigal or Messiaen, alone or with the whole orchestra.
Music adaptability created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of the single man and enthusiasm for music which remained completely immutable throughout the time.
How often Tod just told us to "let music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His tactic technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it wasn't even dictatorial, it wasn't May.
Whoever the musical standard was anywhere, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be attached to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted Guildford Philharominck from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "god on the world one or two dusty pikes".
We'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's notes by Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at Nottingham University, and at that time he finished the dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff crossed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" exhibition because his documentary black and white photos are amazing.
I was driven by simpleness and a powerful charge with which viewers act, and consideration and respect for photographs.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Reno can catch magic moments."
Honda will attack her bestseller for the second time.
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation of Jazz models.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had considerable space, now it offers even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are connected, which increase driving comfort and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this single-space car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is less famous in Europe, on other markets it became a phenomenon sale.
This is a case of Japan, a country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Since Honda Jazz was placed on the market in Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase new Jazz sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates of 100,000 cars, which would increase by 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch management expects to sell 2,000 units a year.
The arrival of new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decrease in sales in Spain.
The car running so de facto expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase, the increase in sales increased its Spanish market share to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % from last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact size with a length of 4.37 metres from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 pieces per year.
As regards the markets, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States according to the Japanese producer, while the remaining percentage divides the old continent and Japan.
The opening of Honda Insight’s sale is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation of Jazz, all dimensions were increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and a centre of axle up to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
Expansion of the dimensions has also resulted in the expansion of the internal space.
However, this advantage was achieved by using a new platform, but by placing the fuel tank in the middle of the car that was already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of luggage space - which has a double-bed system - increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage space for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in version with engine 1.4, since the volume of luggage space with Honda Jazz 1.2 makes 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of a glassy panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seat.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 on the first Jazz model.
In the second generation, Honda Jazz is new and new.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time with a high torque in full engine speed.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litre has 90 horses power at 6000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This motor - which has 78 horses in the previous generation - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses output has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and a emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents precipitation
To progress in the development of technologies protecting accidents, Nissan was inspired in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes on a bee flying pattern, so it prevents precipitation.
This is the Bio-metic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Mark Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four zones of the Nissan Security shield.
Robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation on the cars of this brand.
During the flight each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the composite bee eyes that are able to see in all directions a larger angle than 300 degrees, which enables bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, engineers suggested what they called laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are located within a distance of up to two meters in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the microprocessor which immediately converts it to the warning of the collision.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robots will imitate bee movements and immediately change the direction of wheel turning to the right or even greater angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
The robot, unlike the bee, cannot move upwards and down, or digonally, its movement limits only to two dimensions and towards which it is possible to spin its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities like bees.
Nissan therefore, in addition to acceleration and slowdown, also used a rotation function in order to prevent collisions.
"The establishment needs to process information for only a few seconds and be preserved according to these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't even talk about gigs or megas in our memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies immediate prevention of precipitation, technology in which Nissan predicts the use in serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead drivers to the goal and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear of taking a mortgage
It should be recognised that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has enough capital to give an injection, neither ingenuity nor ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at a bank with doubtful solarity, they created a popular-trained game of "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "The Hotel of Bad Loans"... or a mixed hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionists look deceptive to ask for credit once, twice and three times.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even though not too detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a public space.
And what happens when the game is over?
A dream room appears inside the hotel.
At least something, because he's buying the house, you better not talk about...
Morgan Stanley's opening up his MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley's banking house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that will spend nine billion dollars to get 21% of his capital.
The week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a uniform price of $255, which represents a total amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of securities by 31 August.
The MUFG bank invests more than six billion dollars to get the convergence securities that will provide 10% of its income and whose currency price is 31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the whole operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and got to 23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the Statute of a banking holding company," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new Statute last week, which is to allow him to differ his activities, but it also puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its linkage with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the greatest essay from Wall Street to take a much more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan has just announced that it will sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"We thought a week ago," explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation will be composed exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to limit the risks to the minimum and also cover themselves."
Based on weighted average prices, MUFG will pay by 7 % less than their book value for Morgan Stanley’s securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in share profit by about 20%.
The agreement presupposes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to ordinary shares for a year if the latter are to be traded at a price of 50 % over the exchange price, i.e. for about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his cash.
However, the spokesperson refused to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15 % of Tier One's credit rating ratio, i.e. one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that he reduced his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group because its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payments associated with debt have increased rapidly.
These costs had the opposite developments on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs announced, the only other "livinger" from the big Wall Street investment bank to the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's ransom, which was the only one that she chose 15 billion dollars from Berkshire Hathaway, a group of Warren Buffy.
Rafael Correa Monday at Quita.
Reinstitute the Republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project Venezuelce Hugo Chávez, Bolivice Eva Moralese and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed one presented to the vote, following the pattern of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of the voters, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum 'yes'.
"No" according to these results reached 28%, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the voting leaves were empty.
In order to be adopted by the Constitution, he had to win half votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the east of the electoral rooms and the calculation of the non-governmental organization foretold a clear victory on Sunday 'yes', with them situated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, last night from Monday, demanded victory of his draft Constitution.
"The end won the entire line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadors in the guerrillas of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south of Quita.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chinese counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the United States Organisation (OEA), took place in peace, covered the text of 444 building points of "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by replacing it with the "planning of development" of countries mainly from oil mining by foreign companies and from the currency sent by its migrants.
The proposal by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four years' mandates and will be able to dissolv the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and be subject to a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops is also calculated, which will end the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of Ecuador base as the starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian command took the attack of the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-member escorts, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert ten days, were alive on Monday and were taken to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, in Chad, the Egyptian command freed them.
The handle arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft on the Al-Maza military base, just adjacent to the International Airport in Cairo.
They were transferred immediately without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the marginal residence district of Cairo, to be subject to medical examination.
"It is entirely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garran on the airway.
Since its capture on September 19th during safari in a vehicle with drive of all four wheels at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages were dragged from one hide to the other 35 by unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the Aegypous Agency, safari organizers.
A representative of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 Special Forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, had set off on the trail during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source that he wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "blesk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian comedians.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of Italian special forces.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to professionalism and the effectiveness of people from our secret services, of special forces," said he without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
In the previous evening, the Sudan army declared that the patrol stopped a vehicle with drive of all four wheels on board by the kidnappers, with six killed including the Czech commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, a movement for the liberation of Sudan - Unita (SLA-U), which immediately rejected that movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture resorts
The debate on the financing of culture is filled with newspaper headlines and is the topic of the ongoing electoral campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise up to launder poor sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memoryable places that are starving?
Which politics would be wise to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, as in Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoted three and a half million euros to the restoration of the just castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbours that the protection of the cultural heritage of Americans is a part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in activeness.
In Québek, in the Federation of the Society for the history of Québek, at least 40,000 volunteers combined up to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy of history, conservation of private archives and protection of archeological remains for a few minors.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which are driven by hopeless protests when promoters and executives release their bulldozers into old stones and forgotten cemeterys.
When will we finally meet the stands for history and monuments?
Governments of Benelux national part of Fortis bank
The states of Benelux will help the Belgian-Hungarian Bank Fortis, which was the first one in Europe to get into trouble because of the growing impact of the US mortgage market crisis, partly by permanentisation: three countries will support a monetary and insurance institution, which also has a share in Hungary, part of EUR 11,2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed on this weekend with the President of the European Central Bank and European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis bank is the first in the euro area, which, in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, spread in waves for more than a year, has been put into a major crisis, and the decisions made in this matter could be considered as precedents.
In the sense of a decision born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
A bank with absolute certainty will sell part of its equity shares, in particular - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis bank shares started to fall rapidly last week, in the second half of the week there were serious signs of crisis in the constitution.
But the analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's valuable papers fell only 12 percent on Friday, 14-year-old minimum.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
However, given the current stock prices, the overall market value of the group is around €14 billion, according to business leaders, this is unrealistic.
The management of the company is also blamed for the downturn of Fortis's share of uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the U.S. plan of $700 billion package.
On Monday, shares had already increased slightly.
The new Director-General Filip Dierckx was appointed to the bank for Friday.
The monetary institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with more serious offers.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about them, they will not lose their money.
The bank's clients haven't had panic yet, and the branches have not been taken by an attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and also bought several leasing companies.
Cucurbit leaves
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on data from people on drug purchases, often reject the possibility of closing the insurance contract with the tenderer.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of data on prescription of medicines in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in someone's hands independent, otherwise we're entrusting the canary of the fox," he quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to follow the prescriptions.
The insurance company shall make the insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health condition of the tenderers and, if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance shall not close or close it.
Previously, they sent the medical examinations concerned and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper process: on the basis of the pharmacies customer's identification number, it's easy to find out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself leads, what he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high blood fats, which immediately puts him in a category at a higher risk.
There are currently several versions of the programme in circulation, some also determine the risk coefficient, which means that the insurance company has almost no work in addition to papering, although there are little difficulties.
The disadvantages include that leckter medicines can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, used against migraines or heat muscles, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-improvement factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the first named difficulties are not.
Special companies have been established for the purpose of requesting and processing data, which, before they receive the necessary information from the pharmacies, will ask the patient for permission.
To do this, the authorities are already forced, even though they have not punished them for their own negligence.
Some of the companies have been working on the results of laboratory tests recently, which combine with data on the treatment used, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, while at the same time controlling their use will become more complex.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health care providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which will provide authorities with the power to control even businesses specialising in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: it has therefore developed its programme so that data transfer is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the authorisation concerned can hardly deny, otherwise the insurance companies will not close the contract.
So hens are somewhat exposed to foxy good will.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this topic was also accompanied by other, mostly global problems, also the agenda for the ninth meeting at the highest level.
Today, the French-Indian Summit will also take place, which will mainly focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more opportunity to speak to international affairs, but Member States have not yet managed to find common denominators on the promotion of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the United Nations Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, and President José Manuel Barroso, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that the trade turnover will double up to five years, or that it will increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion, it is not an overly ambitious target.
In this respect, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally aligned, so the green was taken into the future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is among the EU's nine partners.
The Summit has also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism - both sides in all its forms condemned and called for an accelerated UN conference.
They also wanted to end the round of business negotiations with Dauhah, although both have a great share of his present failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that by 2020, it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent.
India also agreed, as with the 50 percent reduction in global agreement and production of greenhouse gas at the climate conference next year, as well as the fact that at the next year's climate conference.
Both parties would also like to prevent food prices rising and support the call of an international conference to resolve the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is joining the French capital today, where he is planning to close a trade on peaceful use of nuclear energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the French companies will receive EUR 20 billion of commissions to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the Agency reports, the Agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international exchange meeting.
The International French Book Fair expects more than 7 000 exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171.790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorable guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural festival in Italy: Italy will actually participate in institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square meters of exhibition area.
He will follow the meeting with the press at Room Structure Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospects regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in relation to overall Italian production is still decreasing, especially due to literature for children and adults.
Found plane Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while he was flying the desert in Nevada.
Trolls were discovered on one mountain plane at an altitude of 3 000 meters, in the area of Mommoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the aeroplane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, sent out the doubts that were still left: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly the one in which Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
So the Sheriff explained that neither human remains were found on the plane nor in the surrounding area.
63-year-old millionaire is considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the recognition of the wreckage, an investigation team that finally identified the plane: it was precisely Bellanc's 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal items were found with one pair close to their residence in Mommoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fossett, both released by Illinois's federal air management, money in cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossetta was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The military has won a place in history, thanks to a long collection of primes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, the world flew around on a plane without landing.
Among his many records include the flight at an altitude of 15.445 meters, above the Andes, even with a copy.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "complicated" Jeep of the Star House, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the virek news into this sector.
Thanks to his unconventional processing, an unexpected and unconventional communication will be accompanied by the placing on the market by Suv Glk and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17th October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of a new vehicle, will launch an unofficial communication method also thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The design of maximum posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins with a performance of a car in a stereoscopic vision and with special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll feel like the car's coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Ellium8 technology, the new Glk will be lit in various eyes in all its little ones, in order to reintroduce in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype area of car communication by this advertising.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hooligans are.
Trivenet, they're risking the Daspo.
Who is the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years, and which, in fact, has never done excessive problems.
She's never even met a fan of an opponent.
The group's orientation is right.
Founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Terstu e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which cities of origin are present: they have removed them on Saturday night so that they are not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc made it available to Italian fans 144 match tickets: all by name, i.e. easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one to visit the stage.
Four blue fans, who had previous offenses from the stadium, were rejected by ticket and banned match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then taking action: In this case, Daspo can be given for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or identified during the riot.
International Daspo forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they just don't go into one stadium anymore.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: this means that more than 100 fifty will join others.
"We must put out this fire right now and not justify those who act in this way," confirm from Viminal.
So, "openly open, mainly because of the national game in the middle of the Leč."
Just in Puglia, there's a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday, Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Choir Leader-Wolved and strained arms during Mamel's anthem, and in Bulgaria, it's not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenica Mazzilli (represented in a very little happy way) who is a couple weeks director of Viminál Osservatoria (a place that had previously been Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a florist at Terst, where there is a core of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
True, as Mazzilli says, there is no crime in Bulgaria to celebrate the leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - supplys an Osservatorial single – crimes are attributable to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has stayed within limits, now let's look at what's happened and assess for the future.
But let's also talk about the nesting of Mamel anthem: it's not a crime, but if you'll allow it, it's an incompetence.
