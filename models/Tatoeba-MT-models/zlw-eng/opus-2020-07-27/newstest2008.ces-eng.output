Inflation in Europe has fallen for food
The fasting inflation target in the euro area is mainly due to the continuous growth in food prices.
The November price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was registered 3.1 percent, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, told Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, the UK and Canadian emissions banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing the increase in raw material prices and falling unemployment, leading to inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain inflation rates below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "defence" inflation, so that nothing needs to be done in this matter later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The inflation in the euro area has been frozen because of the rising prices of food and energy.
The term price of wheat increased by 88 percent, and the soy rate also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month there was already one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop to 1.9 in 2008 from 2.1% this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation remains approximately 3-4 months in the following months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallub sees the government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement has increased significantly to the beginning of December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists Gallub's institute so low - 13 percent support has never been measured.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the voters of the opposition - would constitute more than two-thirds (71 %) aid compared to the five-off support of the MSP.
According to a survey under the threshold for entry to Parliament, their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among the certain voters of the party are the supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view on the economy has worsened even in view of the previous minimum - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is bad enough.
Family values change in its material situation after spring and summer prospects now again pessimistically.
As far as next year is concerned, there is a greater proportion of the population with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the applicants were judged, most of all the previous surveys of Gallupa's institute that the Prime Minister was doing his work rather badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsany believes or very much believes 13 percent of the filed while Viktor Orbán's share is 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the President of the Fidesz 27 percent movement.
One of the indicators for political development is how much part of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without any changes to the government.
While after last October’s riots, the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable 35 percent, this share is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing solutions only in the discharge of the new elections.
In order to be interested in the referendum, it is evident that 60 percent of the applicants replied to the question concerning their possible participation that they would definitely come to the referendum and another 20 percent would say that they would probably come.
For comparison, the 'parliamentary elections organised this Sunday' would certainly be attended only 55 percent and the other 15 percent would consider their participation to be likely. The success of the referendum would be doubtful on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no 74, with a medical fees 79 and a stay fee of 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the area of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of a school, the fees for a doctor and the charges for a stay at the hospital would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five years later by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörsian Trade Triangle maintained last year, on average 16 percent of the price level increase, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Journal by Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság daily in the budaörsian business triangle this year increased by 16 percent on average, but in all hypermarkets, there was an increase of about 1,000 forints in the price.
Since the prices in food supermarkets were already leaving last year in December, in percentage due to the earlier high basis, they did not show such drastic healing.
However, for the consumer, it is certainly unfortunate that what they could buy for less than nine thousand forints last year will not now be able to do for ten thousand.
The daily consumption basket in examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumer basket cost 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the live fish remained almost last year's level, but they were very upset by the cruel breasts, nuts and poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Achachen we found a kilogram bread for as well as 139 forints.
Competition did not go to the price of the product below 200 forints.
In the same way, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-litre Coca Coly in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with an advance product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year he appeared according to the consumable basket of Napi Gazdaság Auchan's daily as expensive as possible, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság were raised by 15, whereas Tesco and Auchan were about 18 percent.
Compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket value was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and top 21 percent.
In forintech there was an increase on average of 1 480.
The average increase in prices last year was 1 206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last year.
This process of trade has disintegrated, business houses have clearly failed to decide how large price margins for each product are to be established as they have failed to predict the impact of a change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question, it may lose a significant profit due to the price margin of the adjusted circulation intensity.)
Due to VAT, last year the price of consumer basket Napi Gazdaság showed that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest difference was the price of all 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not occur, the most expensive basket has now cost more than 1 630 forints than last year and also the cheapest one to raise by 1 284 forints.
When compared with both Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption in hypermarkets has been undermined by more than 30 percent.
(This, inter alia, does not completely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 percent for several basic foods within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the daily economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which was expensive in the past year, showed, in view of the basis even in the worst case, price growth of less than 10 percent.
The flour providers seem to be taking a stronger position than the egg suppliers, the drastic price increases could be established in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a commercial gold triangle don't complain, they're still reporting for a good year.
According to our experience, most customers no longer care about the price at three of their visited shops.
They're buying all the quantum, the durable food's taken by pay.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the treasures, as the number of visitors increased rapidly.
However, as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, many international chains complain to research firms that the sales will also fall behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places they save themselves in disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infections caused mainly by inappropriate use of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overflowing of beds, overcapacity of personnel to stop diseases do not help, says Mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it also saves itself in disinfectants.
In recent years, an MRSA infection has been diagnosed at the St. John's traumatological department.
The antibiotics-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return to the MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his body so far one important operation could not be performed.
By December 10, 1, 094 of the hospital infections caused by multi-resistent disease agents, Karolina Böröczová, prime minister of the National Epidemiology Center, was reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Survey.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistent pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others do not know.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxacilin resistant to gold staphylococca.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of people in their nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. bovine inflammation, mandilla inflammation, skin infections, wounded infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive degree or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to bacteria antibiotics that are very resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly spread in non-compatible hospital conditions.
In particular, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently poor in patients with a weak body, low body weight, or in patients in years, it may cause serious hospital infections such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, similar infections are in hospitals to daily practice.
"Infection must not be confused with epidemics, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of an originator is not investigated."
It resists antibiotics
"We are insulating these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and in masks, and for their treatment we have the necessary antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulas.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sample collection is not in mode
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but the current ratios and conditions in domestic hospitals are not to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-responsible agents of disease, claimed Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection occurs in hospitals and homes for seniors, the hospitals admitted to control and insulating MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most cases are thus revealed if the patient suffers from a visual MRSA infection, the prime minister of the epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy needs to be sought to be targeted, or microbiological examinations should be carried out to avoid drug resistance, but the hospitals do not observe it in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare in the basic, and ambulant treatment of patients, as is the case with Karolina Böröczová.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is spread among patients most often through healthcare professionals.
Therefore, he plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by liquid infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of domestic hospitals.
On the contrary, rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be within a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also meet in hospitals that are in a negative material situation, saving themselves at disinfectants, the nurses are few and many patients, thereby increasing the chances of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures, similar infections, are respected, or further spread of the disease producer can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents enormous expenditure for health insurance companies and is therefore struggling everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a prevention programme for MRSA, and a reduction in its occurrence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the published data, shows MRSA infection in England's decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides for the prevention of the emergence of multiresistent pathogens (which also include MRSA), and also for hospital infections caused by these diseases, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert assessment in the case of Police Captain XXII, which caused a fatal accident, is done.
It can be ruled out that police captain XXII. of the district, who, on Tuesday, killed the pedestrians and who, in the meantime, resigned from his function, managed under the influence of alcohol or hallucinatory substances, informed the spokesman of the Chief State Council of Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of this case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of a first-rate investigation that had already concluded that an ex-cop had not used any alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
Back then, the director of Police Directorate XXII, crashed on Tuesday in Lajos Kosutha Street in XXII. He owns his own passenger car when he turned five-year-old man who entered into a road crossing outside the marked crossing.
(The latter is the fact that the walker passed outside the zebra, according to the rules of the road traffic, it is not easy to do so.)
After transporting to the hospital, the walker died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned from his office and asked for a transfer to the office, according to the police notice, because he was so shocked by the case.
In the case, he's investigating Budapest's State Prosecutor's investigation.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain cooperated with state representatives conducting investigations from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks worth EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy in Budapest signed the Minister of Finance Janos Veres and Martha Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budget financing for transport and the environment projects implemented by the Cohezian Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with a previously concluded loan contract of EUR 100 million, the signed contract now concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Similarly, the credit agreement of EUR 150 million serves to budget the financing of projects linked to education.
For these purposes, the EIB has approved EUR 300 million for Hungary, for the application of the remaining EUR 150 million may be later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which the budget will apply mainly to the Debrecinian University research and development project.
There was also a talk about the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The Parties agree that after Hungary has agreed with the EU the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract is to be modified.
This can occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed EUR 8,4 billion in total 113 projects.
The interest of loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without commitment commission shall be binding on the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is stunning - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a bit of a forgotten Balkan country.
What, where and who buys the most cheap yet, but the fast-nerving EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular Eastern European destination for real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and sea coast houses.
From the mountains are most in the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albina, Golden Sands, Sun Coast, ancient city Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the area of Kavarny and Balčik.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria's analysts, both Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will raise interest in investors and central parts of the country sooner or later, for example, and more and more interested in buying Russian cheap cities.
The capital city of Sofia is also a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf havens of Europe, and it will be next to the summer and winter seasons sought by the destination in another two years.
Predictive investors are already buying in large, for example, around Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain, and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present here, near the Black Sea and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the ski havens.
The foreign buyer has been divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Entrants are buying either a refurbished property worth EUR 50-100 thousand, or a barren old house for EUR 5-15 000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication, it is important for them to be close to the big city, business and usually to the local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria took part in December between the first 10 German recreational goals).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of rising values in the medium or long term.
Real estate management in the capital is continuously, as demand is becoming ever stronger.
While the lowest prices for reality in the European Union are in Bulgaria, over the last five years, 21 percent have grown annually.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than wage growth.
Hydrogen and Hungarian 6 percent
According to information from the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodora, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and after Wednesday’s official opening, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with the meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are talking about a Travel Map from Bali, which deals with efforts following the period of reduction of emissions as defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
At this point, they are being discussed in a turbulent debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to deal with precise figures now, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 due to 1990.
Another big question of the conference is whether the developed countries will come, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set up by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member management board, possibly within the framework of the UN World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungary 6 percent
The Minister for Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodora, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain leadership in its efforts to ensure global climate protection and help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the adoption of 'the agreement after 2012', and is prepared to commit to up to a 30% reduction in the event that the other developed regions of the world will also be able to accept responsibility and responsibilities.
Gábor Fodore pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were set at a reduction target of 5.2 percent, with the 15 EU Member States now committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87 flights, which our country will fulfil. - It is recalled in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a great deal in Bali, since an international agreement on long-term climate change policy should be adopted in two years, otherwise its entry into force would have shifted to 2012. In such a case, the ICC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize holder, would not immediately be bound by the new system of reducing emissions, to which the necessity in its latest report also referred to the International Scientific Council on Climate Change.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsia, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army carries out the recruitment on YouTube
British military forces publish on the server for sharing videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are popularizing themselves.
You first liked the British Air Force (RAF): the special units operating in Afghanistan here since March 2006 recorded videos from the Taliban events, notified the BBC.
Recordings, controlled by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command of the Air Force Control Operation in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
By this form, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have already been recorded on the Internet and over 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Allocation in Afghanistan
Air Force has published videos according to their original intention for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to become acquainted with the general public with the real purpose of the presence of armies abroad.
"The promotion published in this form, compared to traditional television recruitment advertising, has almost nothing to do with the BBC's defence expert Gordon Mackenzie," says Gordon Mackenzie, "but it does not necessarily carry a certain political message in itself, as the government has, in particular, confirmed the legitimateness of military action decided by the government."
The Americans have done the game
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being received on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers most often talk about losses, but they do not show bloodlike combat.
In addition, there have been many videos from the warships in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created in sharp deployment, but the British army has come to them now.
Americans do a little different recruitment - using shooting games called America's Army, which is free to download and where the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through more or less faithful simulation.
There's gonna be Christmas with a toll and a peacock at the Ministry.
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of Christmas party, he will hold a final meeting for his colleagues, to which the pagogues and coffee will be parted with 2007.
There will be a celebration with live music at some departments, elsewhere they will charm the officials of Christmas atmosphere with a tombol and a toast.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoying the power.
Public authorities are preparing for Christmas.
The most important minister's celebration this year will be organised by the Ministry of Defence, but he does not expect his employees to be there.
At Christmas orphans will receive gifts of children of fallen soldiers, family members of soldiers serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange receptions for journalists at night.
Resort focuses on the atmosphere of the end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the dome compared to other resorts.
The GKM evening is held in the center of Jövö Háza, for a total of 4 320,000 forints and of six hundred employees of the Ministry are expected approximately three hundred 50 guests.
Resort will stick to Christmas traditions at his celebration, but it will also take place at a different performance and it will also draw a tombola.
Christmas NFÜ stood at 4,700 000 forints and took place in the State Justice Council building (OIT) - concerts and dinners on the program.
The rental room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
One department of NFÜ seems to be invited to another Christmas celebration: there will be a firm ensuring the conduct of tensors, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented a theatre building called Vegszínház.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
There's no need for a suit
The OIT building did not only host the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which took place instead of Christmas on December 7th, St. Lucie's dance.
However, OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with a health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance as an escort to live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the dance, there were no mandatory night dress or suit.
The Puritan party is preparing for health and work and local self-repairs.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for staff for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth's co-workers are not even officially invited to the Christmas party, but at the final work meeting.
A hundred and 80 guests are expected to receive only coffee and a bag, so that only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply join with his colleagues in the Ministry of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion with 436 employees in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated 2,500 forints to the guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toast.
Since Janos Veres is minister, PM Christmas has been celebrating in a similar way every year.
But atmosphere of the party will be missed, the professionality will strengthen not only the Ministerial speech, but also the afternoon of the event.
Resort agriculture organizes a New Year's reception on 20 January, Ministry's Christmas is not over.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyadvá Castle in the City Sads, and according to the Ministry’s announcement, 1,000 forints per person are designed for 100 guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, which will only be invited by foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with minor hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture of Christmas parties don't work at all, she communicated the portal [origo] to the relevant press department.
The award of Christmas celebrations of the resort of the environment in the press department was not possible.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party at the US Museum.
Move to a giant strike
The League trade union association, and the General Union of Labour Councils (MOSZ) will create their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday, the public protest meeting is held, on Monday - on the day of final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be terminated.
The event will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport will almost stop, and within 13 hours the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association will meet together with the National Labour Councils with details jointly organized Monday strikes.
There will also be a stand-up committee LIGA - the Ministry, which will coordinate Monday's event.
On Saturday, the public protest assembly takes place, from Monday, the union joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that the deadline for the end of the strike has not been set, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If Parliament had not finally adopted the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will withdraw immediately.
However, if the legislation is voted off, the strike commissions will meet and decide on further action.
It is also possible, according to the Monday Parliament's meeting, that the Law on Health Insurance will vote until late nights or nights.
Due to the Monday beginning of the strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: the work on the railway will be stopped for an unlimited period, a part of the Budapest public transport and more than half of Volán will be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, it will also take place in many places in the country to close half of the road.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the call for strike, whose list is constantly updated on the site of the League.
Some organizations have held a strike for an indeterminate period, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungary’s (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSS) could not agree on adequate services, while more and more people travel on rail at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
From the start of operation, it will be held at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. in the morning at Budapest Airport, four-hour strike will be organised by the Department of Workers' Departments in the Energy Industry LIGA, to 2-, respectively, to the 2-8 hour stop of work called on the Department of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The relation of Hungarian doctors will be held alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSS), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SEF), is organised by a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements laid down by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for health insurance reform and submits a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new way of counting pensions will be implemented gradually from next year.
In order to ensure the possibility of being included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZS), falling under the League trade association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic and Transport concerning railway stations and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary’s guard increased the country’s risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarszagért movement in August this year, according to the Division of Risk Analysis (Rivk Analysis Division) of the Institute of Political Capital increased in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
The "risk awareness" of the company developed says: "In relation to the activities of Hungary's guard, the greatest political risk is that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Roman population of Hungary can occur in a short time also in violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to lead to the termination of such an action - adds a research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the largest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: "public discussion about the Roma issue has been passed over by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could face a political strategy on Roma-Maddar."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - judge the institute.
Moreover, the activity of the Hungarian Guards under the research institute was influenced by the great attention of both domestic and foreign media "to a large extent demonstrated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the country’s stability and democratic maturity."
The Institute recalls: a part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-practical groups, which has been becoming more and more and more public than ever since autumn 2006, it is that in Hungary it has been created now several organizations, which themselves are called "national domestic" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly speaking - and armed - the preparedness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of live disasters, assaulting the country, a breach of order), in addition to the incompetence of police, army, or state," she adds.
He also notes: this is all happening in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties to the civilian chapter.
Thus, emphasising civilization and the form of association in the case of these groups does not only serve to avoid legal registration, but also political strategies.
According to the analysis, Hungary's guard activity is also an increasing risk from the perspective of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, they point to Hungary's City in a number of neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranational political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Mayalian policy.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, Hungary’s garden is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so it has increased political risks for the region as a whole.
As it says, the Hungarian Guard activity is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation announced in August 2007 the ultrapractice of the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guard there is a mass Roma riot that broke out in one of the Sofian quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used the guard to set up an organization's goal is "national domesticated".
In the past 17 years, she believes that in Bulgaria there was a "cikan terror", but the state remained ineffective and indifferent, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has triggered a turbulent discussion by the Bulgarian public.
In addition, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signal some Bulgarian Roma organizations’ announcements that they will create their own city's resistance signs.
Since Hungary’s current activity has shown similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not ruled out that even Hungarian Roma react to a threat similar to that, by setting up their own domain, we can read on the risks identified by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhaš, the research director of the Institute of Political Capital: the risk analysis is one of the research institute activities.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds out something that might affect the change of risk, they inform the public as in this case the issue of risk warnings.
holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, the days are set out by law and it has already become a general practice that work days are moving around the holidays, which we are expected less during the next year.
In the European Union and America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
The working days are mostly linked to church holidays or to major historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work day - for the New Year so that people can rest after New Year.
During the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The 15th March celebration of the 1848 and 23rd October Revolution is the national holiday.
August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1, and November 2 we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Letnice and Christmas in our house.
Since our national, national or religious holidays, according to calendars rarely come for the weekend, it has become a practice to move on a working day in cases where we would be working only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends is, of course, that we remain at the workplace and school before Saturdays.
When the day that immediately precedes or follows it, we will process it, for years it has been working in a special decree by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employed workers, to public employees and persons in the public service.
However, companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or in view of their determination work also in working days.
This year's work order will be changed only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, the life will be stopped in the country almost as most people of days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will be "worked" or this will take advantage of a saved holiday.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall into the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar transforms around the holiday of work so that the workers can stay at home for four days taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, in order to replace Friday 2 May, the day of rest.
Next move related to the April 23rd: Saturday, 18th October will work instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of next year will be able to take place completely in the festival sign, because from December 24, they will have almost a nonstop holiday everywhere, even though New Year's Eve seems to be on Wednesday.
Six intimidating little things to upset your colleagues
E-mails that we will forget to send, the voice messages we will never receive, the innocent lies we will never notice again: all of this "strengthens" everyday in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these little troubles, or put on gloves and unclear situations that can make others angry, you're going to avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will notify you.
That you missed the bets for that?
In a better case, he regrets and will try to fix it, or he will call the marketing department and say that the message has forgotten to pass (this is less common solution).
Most often, the thing is solved by one apology.
Before being sorry, it is good to think about what you can do to your colleagues for awkward moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow anything that's not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than when you stretch for some writings, office needs or for your phone, and they're not there.
You remember last night, you put the necklace on the table, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered a pen on the table of any of your colleagues that you have considered lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they'll be rightfully angry with you, that they'll be bitten in their business.
Don't take the envelope or adhesive paper out of your office because it may be uncomfortable if you're out early, and you're going to need it right now.
The gossip about private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the spreading cages.
Who, who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't put your news on everyone's nose about private lives!
If any of them share their inner secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence, do not take it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
You're gonna report your absence for no reason?
If you call your office and call back on a severe headache, because you're not feeling well, or you're thinking that today you'd rather rest, thinking that your work, your hard work and work, which you have on a certain date, someone else will have to do for you.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that there may be something you have to stay at home for, please report that your colleagues and managers will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
stripping, humming, phone
Did you go to work where you're rudely pulled off by a co-worker?
Did you suddenly become a witness to a phone call that would be better off not hearing?
Do not disturb your co-workers by snoring, by singing, by loud conversation (of the head), or by sticking around, by constantly sticking together, by loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disturbing even when they're not being taken into a project (written, planning, organisation).
Are you accusing others of errors?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame for your oblivion of the other!
Don't call off any chaos in the office and the deaf colleagues!
Recognize if you've made mistakes and someone has paid for it, and repair the injury!
Ask them how you can make things right, fix the negligent!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Temperatures and parrots: comfortable clothes at home, but don't fit in the office!
Dressing for free time don't take on yourself, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to your office in common clothes - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
When you want to fit, you stop being interesting.
Interconnection in the usual morning patch.
The radio will hear a special melody: the sound of violin, which is connected to electronic effects.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous tone is added bass, then the female congregation joins as a real jewel.
There's a band called Wings of Love on the station, called "Wings of Love".
The home musical life has not long been spoiling us with high-quality electronic pops.
Suddenly, zappa looks quite different because you're listening to the new album of Zagaru.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from home digital underground, the overall image slowly changes, and although it is again in the garage rock fashion with its milking in the guitar, and home electropop shows that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Five and he also played in Yonderboi's band until the end - perhaps because two duds won't fit into one yard - he made his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pops, but began to reflect until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka's film "Szezon".
Its formation, which starts in smaller clubs, was recognized by the wider audience after the van2 magazine included their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important homeboards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic entity determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "on course", although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it belonged: she made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Intead can open new paths to them, although the name itself tries to create a result with the initial flights in Five-Costile.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zaságer.
The reference to the etheric, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of times - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle group, presented the premiere of the board in Millenaris.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing recently from morning to evening popular music, began to arrest us with the mixed tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("underround Divas").
So everything's okay.
Hvg.hu's portal came up with Balazs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, is there a question, how much remains what you're playing, a fringe music?
Balazs Zságer: The definition of marginal music does not mean anything to me.
I think there are two different caste light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only happen because of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from an honest inner need.
In this spirit there is also a position on how it is accepted, regardless of the language and the borders of the state.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, the light music has a larger tradition.
There's not only teenagers and 20 people go to concerts, but also older people.
They are much more monitoring the changes of light music that take place around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how much of your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more in concerts where there is already a mutual influence, but it is hidden only in the impossible changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you want to fit the audience, it is no longer interesting from now on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works sololy and built his career rather than us west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of the fact that sometimes our music tries to explain.
We're more of a team player who's counting on the musical presence of the other, leaving it to develop.
Of course, at first it was impossible to avoid our work being compared to the works of Yonderboie, for some of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station, the song Wings of Love took the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, are you consciously opened with wider layers?
B.Zs.: We should not have planned to write a hit that we would sell a board.
There's more in that song.
We thought of it as the album finale, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it -- what was the principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a church.
Then there came the idea of putting together this soloist local music scene with a good voice.
So he brought together this six-member congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judi Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikö Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - who was then converted into Underround Divas.
hvg.hu: That's what you thought about the song, or did the girls translate something on it?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in an instrument version, when the material on the board came together, we thought there would be something else needed for this song.
The sled accorded him to join the singing party.
And that day at night, I sang a tune that girls later learned.
The whole thing worked out almost for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember the recovery, but, of course, Diva needed to do it.
It wouldn't work that way with my voice.
hvg.hu: As on the board, so at the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so music just does not accompany their singing.
They also stood on stage in the back.
Is that intentionally?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood back was because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to split up solo roles is, on the contrary, deliberate.
Even this song is about us forgetting our ego, from where it is, where it belongs, and just to let the wings go, the wings of love rise.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, the rest felt.
hvg.hu: With which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, even with one, harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then he found his place in some puzzle.
What song from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changing the gigs, even by letting this album go.
It's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
A traitored broker risked billions of priceless money
Produral defraudant.
Thus marks its former employee, Jerome Kerviela, the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
She lost five billion euros because of him.
More likely Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, in addition, certainly not inability.
Unlike all major banking homes, he discerned the time of the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors who sent the police to him.
However, as it follows from Kerviel’s statement by the French media, such as Le Monde’s daily, he was a person who had profits of 1.6 billion in profits from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity felt early in the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with payment in the past, will have problems.
However, the impact on the entire economy should not have had this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profit increased to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits and adds that he definitely didn't leave anything for himself.
All over the interrogation, he admits he faked records so he wouldn't come across it.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though it began to interest the Eurex storm in his business.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank is satisfactory."
Where did he take the will to risk so much?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He entered Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $15,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with a $90 thousand annual salary.
Yet he knew he would never make as much money as anyone else.
"By the time I got my first interview in 2005, I knew they'd look after me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the launch, the first great success came.
Allianz earned half a billion euros during the bombings of London.
And that was a trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you go.
"It's like snowballs," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew about everything, or they knew more about it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to see it all over the weekend at half January.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became suspect for his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
The broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone looking into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday, of which the Czech Republic can receive €14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to traffic.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will run EUR 90.8 billion next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovation business.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
In the current drawing-up of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful countries in the newly adopted countries.
The twenty-year sentence for the ex-president of Nicaragua has been confirmed by the court
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year-old sentence for the former President of Arnold Aliman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (not less than CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison in his habitable place near the nikragujian metropolis.
If the head of this Middle American state comes back from 1997 to 2002, it is not clear from the AP agency at this point.
According to the President of the Board of Appeal, Ileany Pérezová will now care about prison officials whether they will let Alimán serve his sentence at home or he will go to jail.
The court proved four years ago that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and the nearest followers.
Some of this money then ended in the fund that Aleman founded on financing his election campaign in 2001.
So we've been approved by the budget
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What is this special budget?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government, and the majority accepted by the coalition, without the support of the opposition.
This one went through the ČSSD last year, because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD couldn't afford his absence.
Unlike the busy debate before the government vote on disbelief, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has traditionally been ignored, even though the most influential, passed the law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each ruling begins and ends with individual chapters and budget headings, whether they like it or not.
The budget is a substantial part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the power-based rivalry of the government with the opposition.
That's more grateful in the media, and that's why he has much more attention in the media.
Facing politicians is more interesting to the public than with sharp numbers.
State budgets in previous socially democratic governments suffered three negligences that this one is unable to solve for 2008 at once:
The first is a high proportion of the mandatory, so-called mandated expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits which last year prior to the elections a silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM.
The other one is the deficit management as a consequence of the debt of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of urban budgets and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively under control.
But the time bomb is the deficit of city and municipality budgets.
Many mayors, in addition to the money from taxes, fees and credits from the bank, have obtained additional resources to invest, are often free of mind to issue bonds that are disproportionately indebted to their city halls.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by selling shares of energy and other divorce networks that they received from the State from privatisation.
They no longer have that source.
If we stick to all the official facts and facts, we'll find that:
Our economy has been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, growth phases, and continues to boast of ČSSD.
That was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state owed more and more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on the previous government.
We are among the countries that are at least at risk of poverty, on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have completely wasted in recent years into giant proportions.
Although it managed to cancel some of the senseless populist expenditures, approved this year before the elections, unless, in the near future, the limits of retirement and pension reform are moved, then any policy in this country is really over, and whoever controls it will be mere administration.
With a small surplus, it can be said that governments will become officials, mechanically dividing up most of the money paid for pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, there cannot be a revolutionary budget this year, but it can only suspend the extortion of normal spending by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous government failed to succeed in the last ten years.
If we don't want to really happen that the government's politicians will become a mere officials, then we must be patient and wish this poor coalition government that realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and charges, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the crisis on the financial markets.
Thus, more than one hundred billion dollars will get into the monetary markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank is auctioning interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, America’s Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and for example, another 40 will then make it available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each State have agreed on this coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest problems in the economy, i.e. the growing shortage of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baughal wrote in his report from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 percent so to 50 percent," Baughan said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"The central banks must be really worried about what else might follow when they decided for this procedure," said the lead economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible effects on the global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to lend money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks still had concerns about mutual lending of money, even though central banks of the US, Canada and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that a step in central banks will contribute to the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall in the property market in the US.
Klaus: Ecology debates are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to damage developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again referred to the issue of global warming.
The crisis has now been brought to the end of the UN international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, but also a major difference between the rhetoric that accompany it and the reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured," Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out in the introduction of his book that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction about the fact that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I have met many times only with the caricatures of my opinions".
So now those who are interested can read his uninterrupted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but in his view he had enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to follow and assess professional reconciliation, has experience with statistics and is also a national economic operator.
The main conclusions of the book are that climate change constantly and its changes are normal, therefore, that there is no adequate view of all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and ineffective.
Furthermore, as a person with totalitarian experience, he considers it unacceptable to impose unprovoked views on others, which feels as dangerous to limit freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against 'A reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit'.
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago in Hayek Institute.
Driver failed to change 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to replace an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for exchange so that the authorities can issue a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year they would go to the road of hundreds of drivers without valid permission.
According to the authorities, they didn't change the ID mainly for those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a sharp decline in interest in driver replacement, the authorities in the metropolis are flooded with requests and interest in the exchange of licence this week.
Magistrate takes off about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour in the front.
In Prague, the driver's license hasn't changed about 140,000 drivers yet.
It takes 20 days to issue a new ID.
However, it may be requested to issue within a shorter period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to change the licence by the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver will be threatened by a fine as of January.
The province will pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can deal with a deal.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the penalty shall be increased to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, he may have received a fine from the town hall and the person who's not going anywhere.
In fact, it was estimated that 30,000 crowns could have been paid.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum of thousands of penalty.
According to the spokesperson, Karl Hanzelka's transport department, but tens of thousands of fines are not threatened by anyone.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a citizen's card that everyone has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving license.
Just take it or send it by e-mail to the competent municipal office.
At the end of the year, they will cease to pay the licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licence.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to replace.
The validity of the licences issued in 2001 to 2004, will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced punishment to detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of a criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to 13 and 10 years in prison.
With its definitive effect, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce their punishment by one year and another by two years.
Originally, the detectives in the Prague Department threatened to fight organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is impossible to appeal to today's decision, but it is possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this bail, but he is waiting for the first-state verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received punishments in the sum of more than 16 years.
That's all she can get.
In January, the Regional Court, in particular, recognised the participation in the robbery robbery of 19 people, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused prosecutions since the beginning of the investigation refused that this was a constructed rubber.
According to the Central Chamber, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, passed information to criminals from police sources, covered individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave 30 percent to Opava and Koňarzyka for it.
The prosecution is a criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially the robbery that victims often suffered from severe health harm, but also the abuse of the powers of the public agent and the illicit armaments.
The police discovered illegally crushed pistols, steel core missiles, laser target or gun.
Gang filed a robbery on tens of millions of crowns according to the charge.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this process, the courts have been legally recognised by the guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from the area of Berdych have yet to testify in another trial, some of them have not yet been present before the court.
The main series has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are staying in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their release to pursue the Czech Republic.
Children's exchange account: 12 million
A lawyer of damaged families Igor Veleb wants to pay 12 million crowns for the replacement of children at the hospital, plus legal charges.
For each mother of three million, for father after two million and for children after one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The lawyer of the hospital, Ondrejal, therefore, disagrees with Veleby's proposal.
"We refuse such a requirement, it is very high," said He.
"But in order to make an opinion of the counter, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has prepared.
We'll find out if it's worth a living thing.
However, we continue in the opinion that it will be in the stasis for all," he stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the cause family from Jabloňov wanted every month she didn't raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiations on the compensation of expert judgement, which was developed by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to the field of psychology and psychology, suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they had been faced with regret that they had not prevented the exchange of newborns.
Women find it worse to deal with the up-to-date trauma and what's happening right now, summed up Veleba's contents.
Veronica and Nikola turned medical nurses into a 3rd hospital last December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermák's Dobyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jabloňov.
Hetman Vysočyny Miloš posted to each of the families of 100,000 crowns at the end of October to cover the expenses caused by a mistake of the Greek hospital, which the country establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for liability for damage.
In the event of doubt, they must go to the reserve fund, exceptionally they may apply for assistance from the contractor.
The courts have so far granted a relatively low compensation, the sum has been calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup has lost its kingdom
Bolek Polivka lost a dispute about the mark of the Kingdom of Valash.
According to the judge of the Regional Court, for the first time, he used the mark of the valas king, but the project built a team around Tomáš Harabishe, who worked with the actor.
The soup didn't attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the bail probably doesn't end and the client appeals.
"The problem is, Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasiteing Bolk Polivka's popularity," said the lawyer after the Polivk trial.
In his words, all in the words of the Kingdom of Valaš, everyone will enjoy just an actor and a comedian.
Harabish also has the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and making up actions," he said.
He thinks they're the cause of a lot of money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something of it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the king of valash first used soup on his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzorichtý.
But that was not the case with the intention to build a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing the valash passports.
From the original recession, the trade and lucrative business activity Harabiš then set up the company of the Kingdom of Valas.
In 1997 Polovka agreed to mention his name and signature in passports and even offered to their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performance.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabish had only used the kind of idea that Polivka had published in his mannequin for his business purposes.
"The popularianta Boleslav Políka project of the Valaske Kingdom has certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabist and his team, who was intensively devoted to him.
The cooperation of these parties today continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, they began to gather disputes between Polovka and Harabiš, which resulted in the resolution of the " Bolesslav I. chosen for fur".
The chief role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šulková as the queen of the mother at the roost of Harabis.
In 2002 Polovka filed a complaint with Harabishe and his company, which he rejected today.
As a matter of fact, Harabist could bring a certain curse on the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
The details and the term he didn't want to tell you yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings on Slack.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polícka can sign in," Harabiš added.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I've never done much Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not very powerful, the quality of sorting, control and production could also be marked as sub-directive.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and it is much better.
And the combination called SW is still going a little further away, and I'm not left to think better.
When I was testing a classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, on the back of my head.
This is where the complaint is already over, because the caroserie combination means that in this respect they will not suffer two-meter longs.
The summer of the world
I'm going to move very fast so I don't repeat myself much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have one exception to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate a little more design investment, since the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The sideline also significantly improved against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is a sense of an increase in the dimensions of the bodywork.
The combination then leaves the mentioned lack of space above its head.
In the trunk
So the main thing about this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very good access (and thanks to the glare of the back window) and as well as in storage.
The deaf seats are equipped with restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't move, it can be spread and it keeps harder objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
It is according to the table in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is against competition a rather average value.
Not in the Czech Republic, however, against the most sold car in this class - the School of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of young-oboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is losing a lot of significant 52 litres.
On vacation abroad or when loading a carriage, this value is critical.
But if I had to lift up the positives, I still have to mention the very straight floor after the second row backrest or very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 4-cylinder with a volume of 1.6 l with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how she should look like a 16-man who's driving a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare her to the harmful sort of thing that makes the little guy act like she's got a stuffed rag in her exhaust, then I can only be excited about her.
The pricelist will say
The car price isn't human.
However, we must remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a positive 14-listed car price for CZK 329,900 is still possible.
Our aggregate is worth CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The Premium tested equipment then throws the equipment for another CZK 80,000 on top.
But we still had the head airbags, the automatic air conditioning, the automatic start of the wipers, the electrical control of the rear windows...
Just a car cost all of CZK 531 900.
It's a lot, but you can calculate Fabie's additional equipment and get a lot of similar numbers.
So there's no choice but to make a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
The British schools have children from Eastern Europe, which raises concerns about the further development of local education in local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far led to a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous people are growing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where there are disputes between local settlers and Slovenian immigrants.
Fights, bullyes and fights between pupils have also moved into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham, who beat a ten-year-old man by iron.
The guilty is defending her from being insulted by racist abuses.
The police must have interfered with the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrants.
The girls of a man reportedly caught up with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed up the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave it, he would get on with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even called a dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe for fighting for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70 thousand Slovenians are registered to head here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils visit British schools.
Cuba the prettiest Caribbean island
For visitors, he really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be fulfilled if you choose rightly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, peaceful like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and drinks on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the islands in the Caribbean, you will find it in a complete and even richer reading.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the basca of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and translation of treasures that the Spaniards in America broke and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Nacional Hotel grew up at the end of the 20th century.
He had him build one of the bosses of the U.S. mob Lucy Luciano because everything that was a crime in the United States (mainly a prohibitation), was welcome in Cuba and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were among me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, the high-rises grew, after large boulevards drove cars, which belonged to iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, a short walk from Havana, and in Czymar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Media left their signatures of the showbusinness star and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in Havana Bodeguita you can leave your autograph even you.
In a bar of expensive Nacional Hotel, they mix you up with a cocktail as you wish.
And those cult cars from the 1950s have been running around Havana, because once imported gills and violets in that salty and wet air had long rotted.
Even though Havana, especially her oldest part, is greatly lost, yet nowhere near here is there so many wonderful colonial monuments, like right there.
Other places are transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money, its development has green.
New hotels have grown in the past 15 years not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguin Province and on an oars such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more favor, which is unique in the world, and will especially be appreciated by trainmen.
The thirds of the vast plantes were located in the sugarworks along narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been refurbished for decades, so there are some working masquerades whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
Most of Cuba's most famous visitors don't miss.
And so on Varader, or Havana, you don't have to say much.
Perhaps only to remind you that in the former Hemingway estate is a museum and who likes this writer, he should not miss a visit.
Vineales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinekales valley in the west of the island.
Bumpy vegetation is coming from a limestone sub.
Mounds, limestones and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their hollows, a pedigree earth was caught, which also has a bright scale covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where the Cuban tobacco may be grown best.
You can meet with its final form if you visit one of the Havana fabrik for the production of cigars.
Maybe it's interesting for someone to even get involved in the Chinese work of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The word and riches brought him a slave trade and sugar.
Richness was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, influenced by later French settlers, has not changed nearly in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is a place so remote that there is no road between the sea and Escambray in the 1950s that would be connected to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay out of it.
There was nothing standing there, and that's why nothing happened, and everyone loved that he had a roof over his head.
If a person has more time than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Cucrovar Valley.
In the evening, it is a place to go to Casa de la Música, who comes to life after dark and the music in it gets quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the east of Cuba, some people call it the prettiest on the island.
Such an opinion is often influenced by the way itself.
Both roads that lead from Guantanam there must overcome the high and various mountains and pass through the nature that human activity almost did not know.
The East Island of Cuba has signed UNESCO with its unbroken nature on the list of world heritage.
They make the best chocolate in the church, they have Columbus Cross (in fact it was built about a hundred years after Columbus cruise) and from the hill, where there is a castle and today's El Castillo Hotel, it is seen several table mountains, most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestro's mountains, the Gulf of Pigs and the Isle of Islam de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, Caridad del Cobre's sanctuary, about the santry, African religions that confess the descendants of the former slaves, all of which could be described as many pages.
But as they say right, it's better to see one day.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, says Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the execution of a mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
According to NATO, the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, should draw a specific plan for the coming years.
Missions in Afghanistan do not run according to the notion that they have agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement today, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through the Minister of Defense, Robert Gates invited NATO units to become more active, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The war in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the residents to start further development of the economy and security themselves," said the BBC British Defence Minister Des Browne.
90 percent
According to American army data, the activity of Afghan rebels has been highest in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the Southern Helmand Province, even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the Southern Territories.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of units.
More helicopters, soldiers, and experts for the training of Afghan troops are specifically required.
"We will have to seriously think about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar sense today.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's a little," said Reuters De Hoop to the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
In recent months, the participating countries have also disputed whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are in areas where there is a minimum violence and fighting claims to them are not as high as in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The Sun's British boulevary note this week called the German soldiers as sloths.
"Afghan's soldiers revealed: The Germans play while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-attack and printed a picture of the British unit during a Rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will be off balance in 2009
For each Czech Republic, the government debt is more than CZK 84,000.
The total debt increased to CZK 842,7 billion by the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion due to better development of state budget management.
The Czech Republic’s government debt rose to CZK 842,7 billion by the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased CZK 40.2 billion.
But since June, however, 13.4 billion crowns have been reduced.
So today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its state debt data from early October.
Each Czech Republic has a debt of more than 84,000 crowns.
Over 11 billion crowns have been in debt over last year.
"For the time being, it seems that due to a lower deficit for next year we could be able to overcome a trillion crown limit in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and billion," said Patrie Finance's analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
Similarly, this is seen by the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora: "To cross one trillion we could get through the course of 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget we don't yet know.
If it turns out that the situation in the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not suppose that change," he said.
Debts grow
State debt constitutes central government debts and is mainly a accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by cash vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion this year.
So far, foreign debt has increased CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion this year.
The so-called tradeable government debt at the end of September reached CZK 803,3 billion, and since June it dropped CZK 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of the government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt grew 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarter, which is indeed a lot to how the economy is going.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it's going to deal with what it's going to do when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The 2007 state debt financing and management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion due to better development of state budget management.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency CZK 13.3 billion, a 10-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman is supposed to come to court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a juvie bear.
The British teacher, judged in Sudan for the insult of Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night by the Chartúm Tribunal, as her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving six to seven-year-old pupils to give a plishy teddy bear the name Mohammed despite any representation of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was punished by a whip wound.
This British four-year-old teacher, working on the Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, after several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in September, when the teaching teacher asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class bear.
"The children's mouth will be eight names, among them Hasan, Abdulah and Mohammed," says the headmaster of Robert Boulos.
After the vote in the class, 20 of 23 children will ultimately choose the most popular name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very extended first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself had no label with that name, but the difficulty of displaying the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of his fellow Muslims Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, made it clear that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he thought it was just "an innocent doubt".
Many teachers who describe it as "very careful to their pupils" and add that "they never talk about religion".
Let us remind ourselves that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given first name in the UK, in English writes 14 different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way to honor the prophet (sometimes it is given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toy?
Sure, it's an interpretation question.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Finally, failure.
The Serbian and Kosov Albanians ended in the middle of the morning in Baden 6th and at the same time the last round of talks, without overcoming different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status," said the European negotiated officer Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, pointed out that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristin to ensure that their commitments are kept peace and were prepared for dialogue after the end of the negotiations.
"We are not expecting violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added that "it is obvious that the situation is tense".
The negotiations end on 10 December
Trojka spokesmen, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be last elected to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian speaking populations, could appear in a clearer light at 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiater Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the United Nations Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, Trojka assigned new negotiations.
The Americans and Europeans expect the talks to be concluded on December 10th.
On the other hand, the Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s independence from the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Rusko was and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Bocan-Charchenko.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence to be a single meeting solution under EU supervision.
Pristina declares that, if the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"God, we have not reached any agreement," declared the president of the Kossov Authority Fatmir Sejdius in the Baden Hotel, where since Monday this "negotiation of the last chance" took place.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Albanian Church and future Prime Minister of Province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy introduced by Belgrade "is the past that led to murder and deportation".
"Dominive Effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise still comes into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against any unilaterally declared independence of province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned with "dominant effect" in an area which is still unstable as a result of the 90s independence wars.
"But it doesn't mean anything to Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong solely to the Security Council, in which its Russian allies have a veto right.
"The Space Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštura.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: in the soil of the Security Council."
The newsmen Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status would have a Kosovon parliament" and added that if there had been a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian speaking people, there would have been a "after agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal in the Israelis and Palestinians
At the launch of an international peace conference at Annapolis in Maryland, which was called from its fashion, American President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abas agreed to immediately initiate negotiations with an intention once and for all to solve 60 years of dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them close the "medium contract" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end with colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the responsibilities that both sides are coming from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and Palestine are aimed at "the conclusion of peace contracts that would solve all outstanding questions without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three questions which are in the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven by conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbás took the floor after the U.S. President and stressed that the negotiations followed were "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution were touched by the fact that he mentioned "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, safety, among other things".
Then Olmert took the stand at the tribune, which expressed the view that the negotiations followed should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "contained to be concluded during 2008.
Bush determined the end of 2008 as a term for the implementation of his "see two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside himself.
Saudi Arabia betrayed that Bush had accepted the commitment in this sense before it had decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, offering peace in exchange for the release of all Arab territories that were taken in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "crisis in Middle East history, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saúd in an interview that provided one Arab speaking journal with Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it always happens in such small texts from the black chronicles, the official version does not match what is said amongst people.
What are the circumstances of an accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police General Inspection (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car took place shortly after 17 o'clock on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on the watch and it was running at 40 to 50 km/h, but the side lights were not on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unreported, and therefore without permission to ride on public communications" (see below), managed by two young men without helmets, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit a police car from the left after he didn't take advantage of the right", specified one police officer.
The test for alcohol in the blood carried out on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The state of the car (a broken ancestor, broken front glass, broken bumper) testifies the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontois (Républicque de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned an investigation "the activities of unintentional killing and non-residing assistance to persons at risk", which at the same time includes the direction of the departmentale de la sreté publicque du Val-d'Oise (the Directorate of the Regional Police Department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three Witnesses who were under interrogation on Sunday night confirmed "the majority of police officers, that the mini-engineer approached them quite quickly from the left".
A certain point, undoubtedly caused by a banging clip on the ground, yesterday she showed that both vehicles were stuck until the police car was able to sound up.
The vehicles have been secured and scrutinized by a technical expert.
An autopsy was performed on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel among people quickly spread the speech about police leaving the crime scene without providing two youngsters with first aid.
IGPN had, in all caution, also to rule out "any serious blame" at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of an investigation that requires more search and with which you need to be very careful", said the police.
The journal "Libération" met with an eyewitness for a few moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident occurred.
"We have been with our cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, running down to try to resurrect them," says this witness.
There was nothing I could do."
Then he saw a "deep, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth talked on the phone."
Faced with the fast-growing tension and surely present, that the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were taken away by car colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, an ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the cops left."
They also carried out a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that police authorities did not rush to help the youths.
First aid was granted to these youths.
Firemen arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them", said the D.A.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
The Pakistani police put the first demonstration down on Monday since the announcement of an exceptional state by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers, demonstrating against the measures taken in an exceptional state, were injured by grenades with tear gas, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The last names responded by stone, which hurt several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Similar scenarios, like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and hurt lawyers.
A couple of them were supposed to be called in.
In Islamabad, the High Court attorneys called for a general strike and reported demonstrations as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were crossed over by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent meetings.
Another demonstration was to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (Norwest).
On Monday, the lawyer's movement received the support of the religious parties grouped in a politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "told the population to send flowers to judges who stood up against an exceptional condition, and the waste of those who made an oath before Musharaf".
"Musharraf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is a direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he should have expressed his claim to President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court of First Instance, Mr Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"All we witness is illegal, illegal, and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
The promise of Parvíz Musharraf that he will give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president," doesn't pay" after the introduction of an exceptional condition, on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said.
It was expected to give up military uniforms by the 15th century when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In other words, the Pakistani government has also turned out to be in the country of persistent speculation, according to which the Deputy Head of the Army was supposed to order President Musharraf to take home prison.
More than a third of pregnancy are still unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes non-pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36 %) is currently unexpected, reveals a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographyques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuvirth Act, which in France has made birth control.
This calculation includes non-pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or unexpected.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilisation, are still 5% to 6% of the extent of failure, estimated by Ined.
The use of contraceptives has only made it possible for the Institute to better control the fertility, and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years has now reached 60% in 1970.
Finally, eight births of ten are well planned today.
One pair of five has even a birth date per month exactly and, if possible in the spring, is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of the child.
Appreciable repair of space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed the astronaut Scott Parazyński and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to a remarkable repair of the solar panel, necessary for the further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to the universe, which collected records about the length of time, distance from residential modules, the speed with which the "cutilation" was planned and the degree of "cutilation" that astronauts spent on repair.
The difficulties appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery Ships had released the Harmony module, a large rolling unit designed to install the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is some sort of landing pier for modulus-laboratory modules.
These, however, need to be supplied with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17th half-a-inch power-producing module using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to distribute seventy-foot solar panels of the module.
And in it was one of the panels, distributed as a pull-down harmony, as a result of the retreading of the cable, damaged on an area almost one metre.
The resolution was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who had originally performed the control output to Discovery ship and then went to correct another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction had been forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski, who was chosen to go to the end of the robot arm of the ship, added to the station's arms, and made a repair.
He's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
High, basic, very reticulative, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
In his 46 years, this original profession was commissioned by a doctor to "operate" the "restrained" solar panel.
After detailed examination of the damage, he cut off the fault cable and attached to damaged places of some kind of "dear".
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the compensation chamber, and also from the inside, other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used were a mini-hoc with an insulating device in order to prevent electroshocks on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "after corn" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled and then staged his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts had a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to Discovery to be on Wednesday, as planned, they returned to Earth.
EADS shares weaken
The shares of the EADS in the Paris Stock Exchange will be lost after this company in the air and defence industry announced that it will have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delays of the aircraft A400M.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delay resulting from slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the opening flight.
The price for reducing the delay in the supply of a military cargo aircraft, declared in October, was calculated "at EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus" announced the parent undertaking of the EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new prospects of profit before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT) during the next Thursday.
The group also advised that the new cost estimate corresponds with a six-month delay.
Let us recall that the production results of EADS in 2006 decreased by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the A380 giant aircraft.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French Army would be granted in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's election will take place without a tight expectations: the Russians will mostly choose the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the completion of very little free election campaigns, their desire to stability and authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to voters at public service stations a broadcast television message, but the content of which is kept secret.
They do so by the position of the leader of the United Russia, the Pro-Cremale Party, which apparently celebrates a rough victory.
When the ambassadors of foreign states received yesterday, the President left nothing out of him and satisfied with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for honest as possible the most transparent and open choices, choices without the slightest defect in beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not even that far.
They condemn the campaign marked by different pressures.
Gennadij Zjuganov's communist leader says "they never had such a dirty election, nor did they go to Jelcin."
After the repressions of the last weekend demonstrations, the former world champion in Chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, he still has a ban on visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The government remains a homo svietica mentality."
In the background of these parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are drawn:
- Who will become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The official letter published the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates may present to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
However, there is no followers.
- "What role will Putin play in March?"
Is he gonna be the prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful parties of the United Russia who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the ruling power will win the entire line in parliamentary elections as well as in presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The government remains a homosexual svietica, does not feel to be masters of its destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolaj Kobosov from the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg notes a time-bound relationship: civil society has acquired, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delays; he famous common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms from the 1990s, "Putin has established a paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new paternalism did not lead terror, but a certain economic well-being", says Maria Lipman of Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are "voluntaryly giving up their personal responsibilities" which they have shown shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from the total 85 heads of the Russian regions) are governed by the local candidates of the United States.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the '90s, synonymous chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
The Russians will also not vote in the name of stability.
The conclusion of Tamara Čeděděčenko, four-year-old professors: "Why think?
Those with power aren't that bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which count the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opening up to the public.
47 million archival documents stored at a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available to this time only for "humanitarian" purpose, which means individually and nominally, on request of the former victim or its authorised persons.
Eleven states responsible for the management of archives - among them Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is complete, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen enables to explore "in particular the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, Director of these archives managed by the Red Cross International Committee (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, there have been several states, among them Germany, against making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are expected homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arresters compiled by Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work by civil nationals, to bring them proof of their internationalisation in order to open their way of compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only limited benefits.
"From these documents you cannot expect anything substantially new", said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin, Technische Universität.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
At present, the bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India are awaiting the signing of a free trade agreement, announced the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, the EU’s foreign ministers gave the European Commission a Green Commission to start negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asia (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now at almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement will impress both economies" and "India will gain a better market access of 450 million prosperous Europeans", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported India, specified by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant, together with each year, will change "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services", stated this week Danièle Smadja, the Head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade "is not yet fully achieved its potential".The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth common diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President José Manuel Drurao Barrosa.

The English bank was aware of its concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The English bank noted on Thursday that it intends to ease its current concern that it will again increase the credit market conditions and report a tender of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that is unusually valid for a very long time.
"In an attempt to ease the concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they can secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", stated in the communication.
The Bank explains that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market of 6 December at 12:15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE pumps cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "is prepared to carry out further measures to maintain intraday interest rates" interbank loans at the same level with its basic rate.
The interbank interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English bank have been linked to the interest rates which the banks have betrayed since the use of this offer.
According to a certain speculation enhanced development of the liqueur exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro, many preferred to decide for the sum placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) are rejected to deal with the Socialists (PS) proposals on the capacity of the Socialists
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the Socialist Act on Buyability, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill came in the framework of the so-called socialist "hnízda" (the meeting initiated by a Member State club) and contained dozens of measures taken on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including an increase in employment premium by 50 %, the renewal of fluctuating ICTs, a transport check or a rental regulation.
Given that UPP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was concluded after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on the purchase of capacity.
The Head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayraul announced that his club was to re-submit these proposals in their complete form to the amendment of the Finance Act to be discussed by the House next week.
New Festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presensts founded a new festival in Philadelphia, he reported this promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of British organizer Melvin Benna.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a man who inspired the current festival movement in America without exemplified by Charlie Jones from C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Festival Lollapaloza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camper station.
The festival should run from 8th to 10th of August at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, the Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, in 2006 the festival of the Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolku.
From 2002 onwards, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also responsible for production, license and organizational tasks at Glastonbury Festival, which now has up to 177 500 people capacity.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working together to give the region a European style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commissions, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I was acting with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, we have become political because of the city’s current leadership, adding Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we were about to set up a great festival in an exceptional place, which will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 raised the Lollapaloza festival in Chicago Grant Park, after they went to the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The sharp sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9,8M and 11,3M$.
Both festivals are held in a urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benna's festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals are more likely to take place in green city parts," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to distort both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impressions of the rural festival in Europe and the city of Americk."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Also Vineland, including mayors, is thrilled to support the execution of this event," says Charlie Jones.
However, the last appointed person refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, "that they are sufficiently beneficial to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome the festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the ability of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will hire 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent an invitation, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the time when the program is only sent to the press.
"Vineland will have rock breaths, but music will be full there so that we can attract a wide range of viewers," says Carlie Jones.
C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the last Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself...
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of a delegate.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to hit the Governor's claws?
"It needs to be careful, it's the industry who decides where to go.
If he finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer one which they will consider to be the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
For this moment, however, Denise Turcottea is a priority for promoting a local film.
She's already gone after Oscar.
At all festivals of the West Coast, whether it is festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the Québé films, alerting them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
Age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th edition of Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th edition of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short-sighted and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
At the end of the year, at the marathon storm? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and the investors are already holding my hands in the expectations that there will be a traditional Marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif considers that "in statistical terms, December takes a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to provide predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context of the markets, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the storm is deteriorating in recent weeks and that "the stock exchange market is maintaining the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially the firm income affected by the turnover effect on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the storm will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, "in particular because there is no known impact of a likely fall in FED (Federal Reserve), due to a high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives to inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of the BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that there is no time for a bold declaration to be made.
"There are no reasons for joy," he assures this expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Yet, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year closer than 16 000 points by regrouping portfolios and traditional pension contributions that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different as it considers that the Marathon will take place earlier, during the second December week after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility would affect market direction.
Federico Olucha, Inversis Banco analyst, estimates that we are approaching technical levels, and "We could therefore observe the reflection of the index, created by US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analysts believe these consequences will be positive.
Analysts match the selection of titles that will take care of Ibex to the new maximum quotas.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "letos is a row of strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and certain construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Oluch of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, makes sure that growth is going hand in hand with banking and industry.
Building companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this Marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been reinstated for months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way", explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be in the last part of the year in the foreground due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also be very good, even though not represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times within seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been in two cases a month of fall.
The actual maraton took place at the end of 2003, in an administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by a burst of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, December recorded an increase of 6,68 %.
We will see if the year 2007 will be in the order of the fifth profitable year (while Ibex has increased by 8.36 % since January) and whether he will manage to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to upgrade most of its branches.
Total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and to bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which has also assured several times that it wants to extend its opening hours, has not decided on this step yet.
Meanwhile, he intends to conclude an agreement with the union to cancel the time of 75% of his branch offices on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, even though not for the public.
The results of this experience will be crucial for other actors to join or not to this initiative, supporting the opening of the business period.
That's exactly the objective of the project that the Popular Bank has set out.
Get individual clients who are going to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where there will be an opening of branches.
The bank wants to open 200 branches throughout Spain within about 18 months because it is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing branches.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches already in the trade zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in different streets.
This extension of the opening time is complemented by another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
Ángel Rivera’s business manager assures that this restructuring will not represent a large investment but a larger recruitment of personnel as it is transferred from six employees to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
There were branches taken in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to Rivera it seems to have been a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 special immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredite brand, also have a very long opening time and even open on Sundays and holidays.
The branches of PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model when a number of branches offer for sale a large range of non-financial products.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobiles through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time in the storm doubled the value of her rival Antena 3
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, the Executive Chairman of Telecinco, his satisfaction at the conclusion of trade, when he concluded that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing about him was his joy: 'what I'm sorry about is that we didn't get so far more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And while he pointed out that because of the weak market, 'we were down less.'
Telecinco ended trading last night by 2.5.4%.
This profit has shifted their losses over the past period of the year to 15.66 %.
The value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) with Vocent (more than 13 %) thus reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its competitors Antena 3, which decreased by 1,52% yesterday and decreased by 40.5 % overall from January, is half the value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies, which have been valued, is 3.571 billion in Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antona 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do on the same market, at what price, and how we'll evaluate it in ratings."
Telecinco announced last week that this year she was counting on the fact that overcoming billions of gross income from advertising to become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, Executive Chairman of Telecinco and Publicespaña, a branch providing advertising for the group.
If the expected data were actually achieved, this television channel would have seen an increase in the turnover of 3.6% compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year Anthena increased by 3.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors focused on the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company that was chaired by Alejandro Echevarria, among its shareholders 100 % of its profits.
Vasile states that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already gained 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market in these moments shows certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their estimates of Telecinco’s profit in 2008, 4% and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to explain that the expected increase in revenue from 0,5 % to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company decreased the expected profit of Antena 3, namely 4,5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it recommends buying both titles on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluate better Telecinco (gromit) than Anten 3 (maintain) because of its 'number of preference' and growth in trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to underestimate them because they face 'like threats' (excessed market and impaired economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID applicable from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that have been concluded today by the vote of Congress on novels incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subject to a public hearing of a regulation which develops a new law in order for both to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have agreed to raise the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees modernisation of the financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation enables financial consultancy services to be provided to specialised companies, both natural and legal persons and creates a new type of companies providing financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which are associated with securities companies, brokering agencies with securities and portfolio managers.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and internal command internalisation systems to existing stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk settlement and requires a statement of all transactions carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussions in the Trade Commission of Congress, several adjustments were included between which it is essential for securitisation claims to be considered as a "sustainable" financial instrument due to the high dangers of the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally identify functions that could be held by bachelors in the field of economics and the management of the company 30 years after the royal decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
In November, the harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1%.
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides provisional information on the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat policy and Central European Bank (CEB) providing data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (the National Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily match the final data that comes in the knowledge of 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes declared that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% was "temporary", but also foretold that the price index would continue to be on a relatively "high" level over the coming months.
In any case, Solbes, in the choroars of Congress, made it clear that "even if this is not a favorable number", the Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union has been still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%", said the Minister of Economy to the data presented today.
Virginia plans to make EUR 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock got into the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50 % to 12 billion pounds (EUR 18.8 billion).
The bank managed record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually failed to trust clients within two and a half months, even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it to the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which will replace the name of the entity with its business brand, Virginia Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenue entered the British bank in the next three years, in order to win the remaining £18 billion and thus reach the target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson's magnate group, known in the United Kingdom, is planning to spend £50 million ($70 million) annually for advertising and marketing in order to achieve its purpose.
This week, Bank Northern Rock identified the Virginia Consortium offer, which makes up three more companies, as the ones that prefer it to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard, today in early morning, held the current mayor of Totana (the People's Party) of the Wall, due to its alleged involvement in the corrupt practices in the construction that were revealed this week.
Next, one of the mayor's secretarys and chief of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Member, and until that time the mayor, who, according to investigators, might have been the head of the entire company.
The police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and to avoid further arrests in the next hour.
In addition, he was charged with lawyer Juan Morales, the chief suspect in corruption at the construction site, which was revealed at the beginning of this week.
As last night, Caden SER, Juan Morales' lawyer, who was examined, arrested while leaving Morales residence with important documents associated with corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigational sources, Morales’ alleged selection of commissions for its signature of the construction agreement with the galician construction company, which was reclassified by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted the offer by the state at the head of the Toled candidate PSOE and, if he wins, President of Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists José Luis Rodrígueze Zapatera to stand in the next general elections at the head of the PSOE (Spain Labour Party) candidate in Toled and if the Socialists win the general election, he became President of Congress.
So, at the press conference, the secretary of the PSOE announced José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapeter, who took place today at noon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief of eclective offer to the former minister justified by "it's important in political life to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Manchy would be the candidate for the Socialist Party at the President of Congress if the Socialists in the next elections win.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who published his decision on 15 November not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to address the fight against climate change in university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister kept insisting on him to go back to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also stated that as well as citizens, he knew who would be Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, if the PSOE would win elections, his party wanted to announce the "transparent form" who would chair Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes that he will transform the House into "houses of respect and not a surplus or a scream" and he will feel that "he will become more and more like citizens".
"Unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where it is not in peace and peace to speak is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate, on one occasion, interrupted 26 times".
He also expressed commendable words at the address of President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so that he did not reduce himself to what he said his opponents might view as "the greatness".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to a merciless persecution of both those who look sceptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate firm cohesion.
In addition to having a leader of the movement, which is the Prime Minister Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or activities of his government have made a significant contribution to the failure of Spain in the European Union to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance in which the sectors in which this is happening and why his government, the government of the covenant, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it makes him as clear as possible to the Spaniards as possible, what measures it intends to take to lift climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which the habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, will have to be accepted and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifice himself and who pays to save the planet.
But that's not what we'll see, we won't even see it.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain Working Party), appeared to Zapeter to be risky in terms of the election that he had advanced to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that it doesn't cost anything, a pure propaganda, a hefty, whatever real meaning it is.
Intensive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants with the planet; this master is so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, he does not demand nothing, but is an ornament of possessions and arousing them.
If it is limited to being a virtual party and it does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and head of local police Totany detained for suspicion of corruption in construction
As the investigators reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totan, the "human" of José Martínez Andrea, head of the local police, secretary of the town hall and one businessman in hospitality, for suspicion of the commission of crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his apartment and transferred to the town hall, where he is now with a number of policemen who have also submitted themselves to the Commission for Construction and the City Plant for the Management of Industrial Lands and Flats.
This three arrests came to six, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving over 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land, suitable for the construction of the Nuaria Galician company, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary period, could build 4,000 houses.
Moreover, two other persons were not arrested, but they are charged in a short trial at the court of the first instance of Totana city.
Six first arrests were handed over to court today.
According to information sources, the former Mayor of Totana is under investigation and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of an autonomous area.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Niggan (pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and over which they transferred the bribes.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminal offences in the construction of an operational unit of Civil Guard, whose members, except for arrest, also carried out 11 inspections, mostly in companies associated with arrests, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Ponteder, Las Rozas (Mrid Province) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a very well-known company owner for poultry meat products that could serve as brokers.
Nuaria was appointed as the largest residential complex of Totana's Totany city, which would represent a construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was intended to double the settlement of a village with 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autes and Inomonaar, which are devoted to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Catolico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on promotion, sale and assembly of construction elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the beginning of the PSIA report on the level of education in the world) which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, on the same day, when the Blackburnova book critics appeared there, as well:
"The extent of the subject of philosophy penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, the high school resident quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, a councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded Helsingin Sanomat to take a critical view of Platon and claimed that Nietzsche was not required to discuss in the compulsory primary course of philosophy in secondary schools."

A colleague shall inform the introduction of a criminal act of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a crime with a rate of between six months and one year.
On the other hand, if you lose less than €400 in the shop, this is considered to be only a breach (§ 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to EUR 1 000, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than the withdrawal ( § 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the download rate (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than compact shifts.
The rate between three months and one year ( § 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange of compacts would be between six months and two years.
( § 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. The sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious in accordance with § 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the withdrawal of the movie on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of films protected by copyright is punishable before the provision of pornographic materials to young people ( § 186).
So if my colleague wasn't wrong, she was in someone's hand, and that's right.

My doctor is going to give me one of his articles on strange research called "Pension causes brain activation, especially if the others get less."
Or any feeling that causes monthly pay for employees depend on how much colleagues make.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance on the C.T. and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the head of the group Views of the neurocognic of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation was when the participants reacted correctly and his colleague mistakenly."
Researchers observed that if they had succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The applicant, the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has, for eight years, been following infertility from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in the Hague, a criminal from the Balkans War.
Its mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will go away with mixed feelings, because the main culprits of Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 bosen Muslims died, former general Ratko Youngič and former leader of the Bosenian Serbs Radovan Karadžič are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the name of the Swiss documentary director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, in Spain not mentioned), which follows the pace of detective thriller from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the relevant states to pull the network.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driver's licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
The choice of appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
In the first place, you need to clarify what we're talking about.
The insurance of the car is an agreement between the insurance undertaking and the insured person.
This commitment takes on itself a form of insurance contract which provides that an insurance undertaking receives an agreed amount of insurance at a certain amount for taking care of damage in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance shall be the price of insurance, which shall be determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driver's licence, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies are setting their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident occurs, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons aged 25 years and women must pay lower insurance, since statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
On the same basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that people living in marriage have less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving, and the likelihood of having an accident.
The rate of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when they determine the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose such insurance that is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show you here the most important variables for selecting this type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insurance, will also be at reasonable prices.
People under the age of 25 encounter various disadvantages such as low driving experience and short driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although it is ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers may choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance in order to obtain insurance coverage for all risks, but at an affordable price.
This kind of contract would presuppose the customer’s participation in the payment of the insurance event.
"The number of insurance payments provided by the customer will be pre-defined in advance for determining the insurance price which will be higher than would be less involved", explains Luis Noguera, Chief Manager of First Europe in Spain, Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants by guaranteeing the damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to their own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendation.
If you are less than five years old, try to be observable and prevent accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
Bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, the small is the increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and the few will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, he will be able to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years it is easier for drivers to arrange insurance, as the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"You can usually use the experience gained in advance at the time when the crash occurs, or in driving," says the director of the European Society in Spain, and adds that most accidents are taking place in the second year of the proceedings, when the "strees of the newman" was already over.
However, if the client is married but does not have children, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
The families with children are considered as the lowest-risk clientele and therefore their deductions will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against any risk with a premium (which could make EUR 300) or a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the purchase of the vehicle three years after the purchase of the vehicle.
" Their driving is calmer and their purchase capacity is higher so they can afford to get the highest discount", referred to by Luis Noguera.
Pensions are recommended to be insurance against all risks with a discount of EUR 150 or insurance extended to other participants if a high bonus has been reached.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a reasonable reason to properly study the insurance options that would best suit us in the light of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point on AC Milan that means eightfold
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro stage in an attempt to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, because it would mean first for Italy and the Scottishs would decide to place it.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth match of the tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that Sachťor does not get in front of him with six points to play with the Benfia, which has four.
These 2 games of Group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan for the first time in the 13th in the semifinal, in an effort to proceed to the finale, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the inconclusive result at the stadium Giuseppe Meazzy seems to be the most likely, even though both men will try to win because the Italians will not want to tactic on domestic land and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and ensure a better place in the eighth final.
The Gordon Strachana Manhood could be enough for the procedure even if the Sachtěor does not win, but cannot rely on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week, but won in the first straight game (2:0).
And so players AC Milan will try to destroy the evening of Scots, who believe they'll get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just like they beat them in the same match in the last competition with the goal Of the extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 at the base playing time.
Hope they win "rossoneri" will be the Chesser, for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic has lost, both for the eight-final procedure and for the continuation of the UEFA.
Benfica, although it is last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could win a third place, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour attended 20,000 people in Vancouver
Spice Girls launched its first tour in Vancouver (Kanada) before 20,000 since she broke up in 2000.
"Victoria Beckham", "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver stated that the reconnection of their group is "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so they could be present at a concert, which included a video that describes the history of this group, which created the sensation of the late 1990s.
Return and world tour take place at the same time as the new album published by the EMI in Spain, bringing together their main successful songs as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets that gave them "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Prior to the beginning of Victoria Beckham's performance, she said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what they'd think about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "for conflicts between us" caused two years later the dissolution of a five-member group, also made her nervous when meeting with journalists two hours before the beginning of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," told Chisholm about the reconnection of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that during the time, "the things had improved and we all loved each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last came out in 1998.
So, in the beginning, according to TV, CTV, the group arrived at Vancouver special Virginia Airlines.
The nanny was expected to arrive at the airport.
Five has a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will be performing in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He'll be in Madrid on 23 December.
Concerning new gas arguments between Russia and Ukraine
Between Russia and Ukraine, there is just a dispute on the price of natural gas and thus increasing the risk that Russian fuel supplies to Western Europe can be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by a pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia would charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year has reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State owned by the gas monopoly, Gazprom try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas obtained from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supply from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a sharp decline in exports to Western Europe, which has significantly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of them remain underused.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asia.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said the NHS Scottish Chambers must improve criminal checks on non-European personnel.
The recommendation from the President of Robert Black's Supreme Control Office came after the foreign doctor operating in Scotland was connected to the Glasgow Airport on June.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign staff that employs staff.
But his report pointed out that the other key checks were carried out in order to sample five health offices.
The President of the High Audit Office was interested immediately after June attacks at the Glasgow Airport on personnel received from countries outside the European Economic Area.
The eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove Jeep to the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court, using the video media, accused of connecting with attempts to bomb attacks in the UK.
From the NHS chamber, foreign personnel are expected to check in respect of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK before his work.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses the Disclosure Scotland for criminal record checks, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the High Audit Office says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be given the lead of the Criminal Records Bureau directives to help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not regularly carried out," the report reported.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS was in many ways consistent with its own policy of pre-employment audits, but also added: "Our report points to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information about the number of foreign personnel."
President BMA Scotia Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the High Audit Office pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher also because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with residence permits.
The examination also found that the control procedures in NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included checks on passports, working permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently redeploying policies and directives of pre-employment checks for foreign personnel of NHS.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after a terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment checks of all personnel - including the foreign - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a lifelong film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes for the British Independent Film Awards, including the best film prices.
The prizes were also won by Sam Riley, who worked for the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress behind the thriller Note of scandal.
And Daniel Craig won the candy star for getting the British movie on the world stage.
The prizes were awarded in London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - the soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order - has stood only £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two prizes - at the best resort and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award - because Juliena Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best document.
The best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian mob boss in London’s thriller David Cronenberg East Promises.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation on the roles of tough guys, won Richard Harris' prize for the extraordinary contribution of the British movie.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom crystal skull.
Winston said he was proud of this award, which is named after Camelot's star and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened a door for people like me," he added more.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury, in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people because of the terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil equipment as well as on spiritual and security ingredients.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to feed missiles into the country.
The sympathians of Al-Qaida have been campaigning against monarchy, the United States allies, from 2003, to invasion to Iraq.
The television report reported that the eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil plants in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia builds a unit of rapid response of 35,000 members to defense of equipment from an unresolved al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing factory in Abaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the internal statement of the Ministry: 18 of arrests belonged to a cell led by "expert for launch of missiles", which slipped into the country.
She also stated that the militants planned to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 prisoners were supposed to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government has encouraged the clergy to try harder to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaid militants fighting allied forces and Shiite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider as heretical.
Al-Qaid militants believe that the authorities have copied many clergy in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militanti - supported by the challenges of leader al-Qaida Saúda Usama bin Ladena focused on the western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," said the State TV internal spokesman of the Ministry.
The 16-member "medial cell" in Medina was also arrested, which intended to promote "Tacific thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supported violence against Muslims called the unbelievers and thepostates.
Among the arrests were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Climate on Venus may be a look at the future of the Earth
Yesterday, scientists announced that Venus might once have been a pleasant place for life.
The data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to its main twin Earth than it once thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and converse on a similar road, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that before billions of years there were conditions similar to those on Earth on Venus, and it could have been a population.
However, the compressed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today there is a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and the deserted storm and winds of the hurricane's power.
Findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offers a sober view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Faculty of Physics Oxford University and one of the leaders of Venus Express said: "It is more and more clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planet itself is different enough.
"Our new data enables us to set up a scenario in which Venus began as much as the Earth, perhaps even with the living environment, before billions of years."
The police arrested "rich uranium"
Some radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
Police spokesmen said that three people were detained and the material was examined.
He didn't confirm it was a rich uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for £1 million ($480,000).
It's still in the middle.
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified to the presidential candidates to answer the snowman's questions.
Despite that, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed to the YouTube debate, where ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and handed them over to the candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday 28 November were as comic as snowman, who asked Democrats for global warming in the debate of the other side on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many about the state of the Republican Party towards elections next year.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, were choosing clips that were then shown to the aspirant candidates.
But the first half-hour debate, the longest time devoted to a single subject, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the cat around when they heard something comforting: the voter recorded the summits of consent when the candidates talked about hard access to the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who moved forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was soft on illegal immigrants as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of the Massachusetts State of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
These two struggled particularly rationally when the complainants asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Senior candidates like Duncan Hunter, California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Congressman of Colorado, were able to put their little bit into the mill on this subject.
None of those two have a chance to nominate, but they both stay in the game perhaps because they started beating on the alarm because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least in immigration, the candidates have the same opinion: greater strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about poison toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimise the conflict between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate has started to be very uncomfortable when there are other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulant heating technique should be considered torture.
One complainant asked whether the candidates believed any word from the Bible.
Mr Giuliani, through this, touched the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another explorer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who is now opposed to all assumptions first in recent research in Iowa due to his long-term Christian Conservatism, said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, making him laugh.
The match remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa has been hiding with recent successes in getting money and loud praises from Ron Paul at Wednesday's debate.
These two bounced from the bottom because both wings of the party are still unable to agree on the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincedly with the winning news about the American size on the lips, murmuring on both wings of the parties.
This time the party is split and the result has to be unequivocally far away.
Labourist pains
Gordon Brown once again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is customary in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
It doesn't seem to be sold by any rules, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extra-marriage rings have been cut off.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would be around without discovering that some wealthy businessman had masked contributions under the Labour Party of $650,000 (1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided elections and insulted British intelligence, claiming that this decision had not been influenced by surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a durable and effective government.
Instead of making it more and more fun representing the Chairman of the Liberal Democrats, once concerned, Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of Northern Rock's problem bank has shown weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Wrongly thought-out proposals for a change of tax law brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative tactics.
The three generals retired started the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed that being the commander of armed forces was work on part-time.
Now there are numerous gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labourians (and their former security guard of internal discipline), has resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would go to his end unreturned end.
In spite of that, governments can reach the point of breakthroughs behind which they find the rule heavy.
People don't believe in politicians and don't like them, but they usually take away their distrust when they take over a new crew.
Since it seems clear that some prime minister will probably not improve anything, and it may not be long in the office, this shift is gone: the state administration becomes a thank you, the ministers start making briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because against other political leaders, he can't take the position of a new anchor.
As much as he liked to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the Northern Rock problems and financial records are linked to the decisions that Mr. Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And although he has not been directly involved in blair troubles, such as a long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "reliances for money", voters may be able to conclude that he was.
Yet, Mr. Brown is not as bad as they look.
These superstitions aren't as terrible as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was deluded.
And treatment, however painful, is to provide what the Stalinist trend of Mr. Brown has always promised: a reliable, firm and easy brutal government.
The latest excitement about political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' procedure, but he didn't know he was illegal, he would certainly be questioned thoroughly; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labourer of the money that learned about the dark gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing that would suggest that he knew about these things, even though the main part of the payments took place after his launch in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of laws by his own party, but settled his decision by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission for examining this matter - led by an even more bishop in retirement and judge.
In this case, learning is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is the matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding the Permanent President of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no more than six months, and going forward with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
That would require the Labourians who are in close cooperation with the Conservatives and may even give up their special financial relationship with the union - bitter pills for a given party such as Mr. Brown.
But it should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in reconnaissance; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is invulnerable integrity and high authority.
Card sharks
Does the US credit card market affect the crisis of sub-prime mortgages?
When there's blood in the water, naturally it's going to get aroused around the spine.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is shrunk, the predators focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that credit card losses would have been worth $99 billion if other options of consumer credit could have been made of sub-prime mortgages.
The voltage signs are clear.
The number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days of late payment) and the accounts sent (indemnities which the provider considers to be indemnable).
The HSBC bank announced last month that in the US consumer credit market, $1,4 billion - also due to insolvency credit card loans.
However, it is still early to panic.
The accounts and the inability to pay back are still low.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, there were 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter of almost the entire percentage point below the average.
The deterioration may be partially explained by technical reasons.
Thus, the change in the US laws on personal bankruptcy in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported banknotes, which make a large part of the loss on credit cards; the number of reports (and the number of write-downs) would increase regardless of whether the general conditions for the lenders have worsened.
The sector also has a good degree of maturity, which shows how much consumers pay per month from their debts.
And trust in credit card-backed securities is firm, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research company predicts that the volumes of their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways to spread infections between subordinate mortgage crises and credit card markets definitely exist: when they dry up property loans, consumers tend to owe themselves to credit cards.
However, credit card publishers tend to see a cash flow rather than the value of the guarantee items, so that the falling price of home does not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the lenders.
They can even be advantageous to lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up to the list of payment priorities.
Card issuers will also be able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of hand-held items.
"It doesn't happen that one beautiful morning we just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of sub-prime mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will stand before the darker future.
Watch out for those back sails.
The British bankers admitted guilt in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were supposed to be meant for their role in fraud associated with the former financial manager of Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their testimony on Wednesday and admitted guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when together with Fastow in 2000 they were supposed to participate in financial fraud -- get rich in the employer's account -- denying.
They were supposed to stand in January.
However, during a court trial before the American district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest employees, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was based on front pages for the past two years, which lasted the notice procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unopened parts of an investigation started at Enron in 2001.
The charge against them in 2002 made by Mr Fastov pointed out that it was the goal of a government investigation concerning the crash of Enron.
The prosecution against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to dream up fraud together with Fastow and his former chief brancher Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the partner branch of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was an architect of many enronic frauds, which marked Enron along the spiral towards the announcement of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch by zero, but our three British knew that it actually had a significant value.
The company under Kopper Control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper for a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's prosecution, Enron reported that the energy company would pay $20 million for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, the 20 million were actually British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow blamed two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
The miner is in the execution of three years' punishment and one month in the Texarna facility.
All three British people were freed into bailing out $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of account tricks could no longer be able to hold billions of debt, or to report misguided speculation as profitable.
The collapse canceled thousands of jobs, over $60 billion of market value, and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of the Enron Kenneth Lay and former Chief Manager Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their role in the fall of society last year.
Skilling is more than 40 years old.
The judgments of Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-inclusiveness
The price of the aircraft Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, of course, this is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a close family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in a stand at the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of displayed consumption in the mammoth of the exhibition center on the sheriff of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other suppliers of luxury were building their stand, hoping that freshly rich Russians would attract to everything from the mahogany yacht to diamonds decorated with bulkheads in cars for which neither 50 Cents would be ashamed.
Mr. Firer carefully looked at the bright orange Porsche in the side booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's fives and tens against us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market in private aircraft."
In the waves of oil, money is played in the Russian capital as well as when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were extremely rich and dragged into Europe, looking at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year at Davis's centre of Russian and Euro-Asian studies at Harvard.
Just as the Saudi bouncers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s become the world’s most prominent losers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Clondik.
In another place in Moscow, the conference of the luxury industry of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaulta, the president of the LVMH Group to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia, according to the list of the richest people in the Forbes magazine, has 53 millionaires with a total fortune of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local Institute in Center for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which in Russia there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires whose assets in the sum are worth $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of the Russians lived below the limits of the existential minima in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly modified, and men are all full of wealth."
When they walked in evening clothes on Sunday night halls, the 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatovová and five years older Světlana Turov identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms.Yumatov, who was looking into the branded clothing as a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home-made stick.
The fair seemed mainly focused on fresh rich, branded Russian buyers, who are willing to sit in traffic for several hours so that they could pass through the warehouse, which shrouds Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, ice cream Mövenpick, roundboards for peace, apartments in Dubai, Gund and tranch.
Members of the public alone could buy tickets for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which the brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch producer porcelain Royal Delft before reproduction of the Rembrandt's image from hand-painted blue cup in an overlife size.
"Of course, we're interested in the Russians more positive."
And indeed, the salesmen here say that the Russians with old money (the Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved to little known signs of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, millions of ambassadors or short tourists, the day flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, said Roman Ershov, local manager of King Koil bed, that he sold two mattress sets from silk, cashmere and cotton, covered with gold yarns, after 70,000 dollars.
Also the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who entertains high-end high-end alarms that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for $170 000 Russian millionaires.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who would like to fix luxury cars that he sold three bars to cars in the style of connected necklace bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms after $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, which had an extract of the Swarov crystals so that it looked like a rube.
Price: $22,000 for four like that.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels of wheat leather or the portrait of his wife from a crystal zirconium doesn't have to ride on those wheels," said Karapetian.
"He puts them in his garage about 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, he said Mr Karapetian that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean anything too exclusive, given the great rise in prices of local properties.
"If you bought three or four years ago in Moscow an apartment, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has set up four red phone booths of British style, a broken column of false banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500 000 fake bills for the Millionaire.
The passengers stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let friends take a picture of themselves with a mobile phone, resting in the middle of a replacement fortune, or just stuff up a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by damaged operations
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant here. A little healthier and followed the ambulance that came to the white New England house by two houses that were after West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car was joined soon.
And then another.
"Then I saw the delivery of a medical doctor come in," said Mr Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"At that moment I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroy, 41 years old, executive assistant director of the New Africa Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at the house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they are hoping that toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that caused the neowar police to send out a wave of sorrow.
Ms. Arroy was an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known for many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-war police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that he leaves behind two sons of age 14 and 11 and step-daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson of the Union’s State Representative, Theodore J. Romank, said that the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the choices," said Ms. Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon 21.
November and Miss Arroy found on the couch.
She was declared dead on the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities have still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly the Florer Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Miss Castro's authorities had heard from her.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at the house of Miss Castro, with a tanned pink bush in the front garden and a dalmatine barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, the throne took a blue barrel in the open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillan" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy remembered that when he first arrived in New York Police Department in Newark for 25 years, Miss Arroy provided him with valuable help in biting with the insufferable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, "On this or this, you should be careful," he said.
"She was always here when I got here, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that Fed lowers interest rates are leading to a strengthening of world exchanges
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday jumped after the market hope that the Federal Bank would attempt to calm the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates, were strengthened by calming comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
Burzy jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order for Ben Bernank, President of Fed, said that in answer to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets, "flexible and pragmatist" managers must be.
In the framework of the obvious attempt to calm the irritable markets in the middle of the signs of resurrect credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent insurrections "in part returned some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
Furthermore, it stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of household financing and firms getting worse will be increased.
Investors consider these observations as a signal that Fed is prepared to add additional fresh capital to the US markets and perhaps further reductions in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street down in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when selling flats in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial beliefs have been undermined by the notification of Bear Stearns' investment bank that it will cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its global labour force, in the context of cost reductions due to compensation for heavy losses caused by an unsustainable bet on the provision of subordinate housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew 331 points, or 2.55%, and closed for 13 289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2,65 percent.
The FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and closed to 6,306,2, while the value of the British blue-chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit tension on the markets proved to be fully in full after the auction of the three-month cash packages of the European Central Bank were borrowed by European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the English bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release super-standard money on London’s money markets increased by increasing the rates of the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to their maximum from the end of September to 6.59 percent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the wider context, it's nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who's to make this decision?
The second question is therefore that David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, which is best placed at this post at the most, has Peter Moores, the lead coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help and since Hugh Morris's main manager of the English team begins to comply with applications for the national selector's post, although not necessarily full-time.
Those who will not be built in the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport at all.
It's not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket that choice is challenging and requires an assessment that, in the end, must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shaho, if it does?
We could also ask the same question in other areas, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banjere, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee - the place is for one.
Who's supposed to say which level is right for the Cricketers if you don't get a chance to drop or spit on the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have great influence on decision making, but they still have opportunities.
The Cricket team has to capture the Captain's view at the right time, if it's to take the Wicket, and the jugger needs regular chances at start positions, if he's ever supposed to make it feel like a day's Cricket.
It's more complicated to capture the sampler's view.
In last season, for example, there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first test, seems certain even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched over as a workman.
Anderson took 32 victs in first grade at 33 shows for each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for another.
If he plays at Asgiri Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can go or reach a career of both, or may not have a great influence either.
Four years ago, Gareth Batty played for Sri Lanka in every test and in first grade he gave good performances, five Winquets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is in addition, although in Australia against Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's more experience than Bopar's youth field.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks his sparkly and valuable debut shift at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to the six Bopars in twenty years, seven years younger, and has excellent statistics against spins.
But Shah made two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, only ten runs, and this, together with immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to take him back to the next match, his firing seems to have taken something from the elan, which was so obvious in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex Universal has Joie de vivre in the bones.
There's nothing out of his playground, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently turned car with a lead on four rounds on the exhibition days of the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He took out with light injuries and probably a shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching from afar to say, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed loops on the local courses that seem to suit him, gives him effective, self-confidence and hand-off.
Selecting the right person is one thing to choose the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I tend to make Bopara his chance to get now, which I don't want to say is Shah won't perfect if, as cello tea tickets suggest, he'll be the one who's playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and to fight against al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday and to dump refugees who had run out of money or expired the visa validity period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some of them even came back to fight the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansur Bus Station had been before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convention of dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni Doctor.
"This morning I came back for what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers about what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, has been thinking of Shiite militant spiritual Mutada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to break the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher from mostly the Sunni region of Amaría, came back with his two children because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the regime he had not allowed Iraqis to work there.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaraji called him to help the local domesticist with the support of the U.S. Army to push al-Qaida out of her position in the west of the capital, and they insisted that he return.
One of the new arrivals in Jordan was the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, which he had taken from his home in Sleikhu in northern Baghdad out of a grenade attack after he insisted on his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me and told me he's starting in Sleikhu's mistress against al-Qaida and that he needs me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabah Al Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and growth of local "conspicuous citizens" which defends its quarters with weapons in hand by the American army.
But more was the fact that they were brought to return by the apparitions about the visa and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a one - year - old father of three children, called out suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas and thus force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"It was all right before Al-Malika visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left."
A partial reason for weakening violence is that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are concerns that the sudden inflow of refugees is re-inhaling sectarian tensions and leading to further struggle.
Small Sarah, good education
The smallest country in Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, and it promotes even international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational area is Sarah’s same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"The man who does not come from Sarah, I explained yesterday after the 1950s that we are not any French" - this self-defence password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can end the study by double or even triple diplomas.
Which corresponds reasonably to the high share of foreign students, which accounts for 15.6%.
After all, an excessive number of Sarah's children are admitted to college - many of them without study in gymnasium.
"Axel Plünnnecke, an IW educational expert, is used in Sarsk.
By gaining more than five juveniles permission to study in a vocational school, Sarah is more than 7 % above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarah to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility to study two fields is given the number of inhabitants of the second best in Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of graduates of engineering has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education has now commanded universities to create a promotional campaign on engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have made several reforms at general school," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start teaching as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that takes over other social countries.
If the results of pupils are significantly improved, they will show up for future comparative studies.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the share of risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20 %.
Total, however, Sara has not improved as much as any other Federal country.
He can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah’s studies Pisa do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could be in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory in the gymnastics, even though the inhabitants of Sarah are not French.
Chavez's moving the clock.
Every time they see it, the clock in Venezuela is different from the rest of the world.
9 December, President Hugo Chávez will move the hours in this South American country back half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
Venezuely's official letter informed that the hours of the new law, compared to the world's time, will be shifted by minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, has justified his decision, among other things, by making the United States a distribution of time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, Chávez announced at the centre of local time that, due to the hostage bail, he was interrupting relationships with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist declared that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not even maintain any relations with the Colombian government.
"I cannot, for my self-respect," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, which the citizens of this oil country have to vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The attack caused Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's commission to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized the Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone's talking about Chávez in Spain too.
A new mobile ring here has triggered a start: "Por quoé no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - that's the sentence that has been downloaded from the internet for more than half a million people.
The Spanish king Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, spoke the notes of this left-handed populist, were so upset that he had silenced him in this way.
Germany threatened to pay less in 2007
According to the forecast, Germany’s employees are under threat to a real wage reduction this year despite a strong conjunctture.
Experts gave their pessimistic forecast a whole range of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employed people can really count on getting a lower wage than last year.
"The wine carries a small increase in wages, increases in value added tax and increases in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn from the research institute IMK (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
A new burden on employees may also be waiting in the field of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that, for the new year, the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3,3 % is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youths, to quote the paper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest state in the last 13 years.
Total prices increased by three percent in the annual comparison.
Venus is a helly twin of the Earth
Despite its life, the hostile atmosphere is more similar to Venus Earth than it has been assumed so far. The European Space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that appear in winter also on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and windy faith in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus has been missing.
Now, the Venus Express European probe brought evidence - it caught electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus, lightning flies from clouds to clouds at about 56 kilometres, he wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a known theory of primary matter creation on Earth, lightning caused life, storms have allegedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
In Venus it was not that: "If there ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie's Institute in Washington.
Today, something living could hardly be found on Venus's surface. Atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"The village may be a hell of a twin Earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so material and size-like, has developed completely differently, is the fundamental issue of the Esa mission.
Since since the early 1990s, no probe has been issued exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of Venus Express probe in November 2005 has been a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results that attracted several articles of the Nature magazine did not only stress the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like the Earth than it was supposed to have been," said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind wind winds on the north pole, scientists found an frozen wind on the southern pole that spins significantly faster.
This phenomenon recalls the air currents on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same matter as the Earth and with an average of 12,100 km is almost as big.
This planet, referred to as Jitřenka or the Evening, will be about 225 days from now.
It's about its own axis, though, it's turning much slower around its own axis, and it takes 243 days on Earth one day on Venus.
Although Venus surface temperature 460 °C and pressure 92 bars of Earth do not remind, scientists are based on the fact that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
But on earth she remained in the oceans while Venus was out of space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to carbonate on Earth, Venus creates most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama
The Federal President Köhler calls for the completion of party disputes for the adoption of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's office.
He specifically criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about the reputation of Germany and calls for a large coalition to end the weld around the acceptance of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not uniform on this issue," Köhler said to the Business News Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal effect for me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President pointed out that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Merkels from standing up when it was calculated that it was creating a new policy against China.
"The Polish Chancellor has not left the traditional single Chinese policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made his opposition to the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and he was attacked by a series of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of foreign coalition policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor Office, German-China relations have worsened.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German finance minister Peera Steinbrücka (SPD), but the so-called strategic dialogue of both countries has also frozen, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL magazine.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognise that the acceptance of Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, stressing Wen Jiabao's position as China.
Words and deeds have shown that Tibet and other Tibetan areas, also located in China, are trying to separate themselves from China.
Schäuble warns against similar unrests that have leaked in France
Street battles with police, firefights, fueled cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar unrests that broke out in France.
We must do all we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, calling on the Federal Minister of Interior.
Baricadas were burning, the robbers were shooting shotguns to the police. After serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany as well.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions that will burst into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said in Neue Presse's Hannover newspaper.
Not every young person can cope with a quick change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the country and communities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not mean just integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after an Islam conference, we record the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In the past nights, youth with police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been conceded by hard street combat.
Even in Toulouse, there were cars and public buildings burning.
More integration efforts by the German Government were requested by the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned about the "similar effect".
Although the situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among the people under the age of 25 who came from the families of migrants, the unemployment rate is "excessly high".
Above all, more study opportunities are needed.
Kolat pointed out: "We must give youth hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is more social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat was like, "We have to be careful."
We need to make it possible for young people to start working and education."
In the meantime, the night remained on the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel largely calm.
There were hundreds of police officers in place, and helicopters were flying over the area with lights.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and a number of burned garbage baskets and cars.
From yesterday, about 1,000 fine forces have been taken care of.
Police will intervene as long as it is necessary, announced after visiting the suburb of the Secretary of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, there were riots of Toulouse.
The accident caused a Sunday car accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Attorney, the police are not responsible for the death of juveniles.
In Angela's Land, "Calls."
The Chancellor's remote output documentifies that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it alone.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her fearless, indifferently sounding and contentless poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Chamber, we must state: not here - not in this country, which it should eventually manage.
The regret that she's focusing too much on foreign policy has once responded to Angela Merkel with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, and she showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
She obviously demonstrated how much she deserves in the Federal Dream.
Merkel didn't feel even real interest, let alone feelings for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Ollak" was presented: a politician who evicted beyond others who flee into foreign politics, and there it is expressed only misty.
For example, climate protection: without stopping, is praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendam Summit, but does not say how this climate target should be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such self-governing - so many indifferences would have forgiven the CDU president two years ago.
Now she's confined to a planary phrase that could increase her taste among people.
By this approach, it harms its immigma who does not need to flatter because it solves problems.
But in Angela's realm, "Ollaks" are internal political problems.
Child poverty and concern for people with low wages?
A few other sentences on these subjects are left.
It is worth noticing how often Merkels, when it comes to children's additions, she translates.
Three times, Merkel must begin from the beginning to manage to say at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things get very specific, they're staggering like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates for Youtube is in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has spread out in a hard discussion - and they both must now be afraid of an outside candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already shown in the first issue.
Mitt Romney presupposes his opponent to Rudy Guiliani that he made a "cash for illegal immigrants" out of New York.
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp accusations: "I believe his own house was one such refuge," he answers and presupposes the former governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without evidence.
The candidates are being attacked, since the Republican base has not yet had a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates at CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, online users are filmed and via Youtube sent videos is used only as such hints of key topic.
"In fact such a policy of isolation, we allowed Hitler to take power," said John McCain, his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of the troops from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain doesn't save his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn a torture method called "Waterboarding" in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the method of torture belongs between important themes of the campaign.
The price is increased in the background whenever conservative values are praised and the future tax increase was rejected.
So it shows where the weaknesses of both favors lie.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney in short, asking for a party base and a television audience to forgive for being a advocate for the execution of abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first time in a civil war
The day after his withdrawal from the position of the commander of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharraf made a presidential oath on Thursday, and he continues to hold in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan's television was transmitted live to the ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
In the middle of his office, the commander of the army, handed over to Ashfaq Kiyani, his confidant, who subjected himself to international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after he took power in an unbleached military coup, former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of the state.
The withdrawal from the position of Chief Commander of Armed Forces met Musharraf one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
The next central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to the Chief Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will cancel the extraordinary status soon after his oath, thus fulfilling further requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the Land, which, after the announcement of an exceptional status at the beginning of November, occupied him with incompetent lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-registerment of the State’s head on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed during the attack on the military convoy in North Vaziristán tribe, and four more were injured.
A spokesman of the army said the bomb went off on the road near Afghanistan.
Father's cranberry returns.
The famous German group of the 1970s has been playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group have again taken over their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, cut from the most successful band period.
They were much more familiar in the foreign world back then.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three settled gentlemen who initially look like they're just enjoying their dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
Threety-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snowy shirt sitting in the middle.
After his left, there's a seven-year-old Michael Rother who's got a laptop and a guitar ahead of him.
The three-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedeliius, who concentrates on synthesizers, is from the sight of the viewers on the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, certainly, will create a traditional song.
It seems to the masters of musicians do not mind.
Among the lovers of the cranium, he was reviving the band Harmonia with a considerable dissolution.
One thing here is worth noticing. Repeated questions have shown that although this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not quite congruent enough to miss this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't the German too celebrate his still living legends of the 1970s?
Especially when he has a musical style, mistakenly called "cratrock," England and America value more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business gave the remaining members of the Can Group the Echo Prize for life, the hall was full of challenging views of the German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked in their speech to La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the wonders of viewers no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers shows sat on stage like their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
The memories of Harmonia's band are overestimating the memory, this trio was only two years old, and not even at that time had a long way of not having the effect that others later received.
Moebius and Roedelius have already played with Conrad Schnitzler's artist under the promising name of Cluster.
At first they played in the cellar of the Berlin Theatre of Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a turntable company led by the Church.
With a short cut off at the Kraftwerk group, Rother gained the reputation as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Claster band to exile in Forstu, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, were living as members of the communes who fled the city.
They were not as ideological as in Communion I, where Roedelius could still be found as a nanny.
It was rather a life in such a Spitzevian artistic existence.
The name for the given art is allegedly derived from the name of the singer’s choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the ashtray.
Many of it has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "The Music of Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of plants did not just serve self-recognition.
Now released "Live 1974" CD, which was written at a concert in Griess, was collected before a record small, barely 50 members.
In that time, Rother expressed his desire for the members of Harmonia to train and train occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely inappropriate request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere, and his future was insured with an album "Smoking Heart."
Cluster's capital was relived in the 1980s, and since then it has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for his live album from Griessemer.
Its recording company Grönland took the aim of taking care of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu capital, at that time, was considered Roedel's solo work.
The fleshly resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The performance at the Woldronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Founder Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
Thus we have drawn the total width of the influence of the cranium on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled in just Harmonia.
Brian En's spirit accompanied by the most extraordinary sounds is rising in the hall: "The only real music belongs to her future."
There are images on which the manufacturer with Harmonia is in the agricultural court.
To create legends also contribute to showing other black and white photographs on which a set of wildly connected cables are set of instruments.
Prior to that, three veterans are once again employed by improvisation.
Not polishing microphones on organs and drums to get those unheard-of-the-box notes out of the tools.
Today, electronic music looks like an electronic music.
Three to the positor's collapse technique.
It doesn't change the congregation of world cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings emphatically, "Aaaya!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It's never been rock.
We would rather find roots than blues in music universities (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be able to come out of peace.
Even the most obvious of all is carefully thought out on the stage.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question of man will either prepare for the nerve or allow him to experience the passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden released two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither one of them is persuasive.
The window of films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too touching.
The Hunting Party is not going to stop this actor like Richard Gere.
Good news as the first: War criminals Karadaz and Mladić still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosen War, the actor Richard Gere will be obvious.
In recent years, we have lost this most beautiful man in the '80s, not only because he has played in many lovely, unwary roles in fine women's films, but in conjunction with his press conference forever on the subject of Buddhistism, he will take the taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument to see The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become the prey (Why must the names of films be so long and confused these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could become if fate and film business were not so merciful: a man who, though he has long had his best years past, still retains a certain remarkable charm as a caretaker.
But despite this trumf, The Hunting Party is along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, only by continuing the endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who saves the Serbian girl from the kosovský sniper, while one of them falls in love with it.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evils, this television movie is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's something like Kobru 11, though without a highway, but for the war.
The film "The Hunting Party" can be carefully explored why it has not yet been able to make a really good film about the Balkans War.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are going to be a "noise", a Serbian war criminal, might be led by another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) might become a new "Apocalypse".
Both stories seem surprisingly like them: little groups go into the forest to perform something that is not capable of the army, but their path will be the way of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the sudden and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the forefront will prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered bossen Muslim.
The Hunting Party's film can be finalized after the reporters in the last five speedy minutes of the film will lead to NATO, the CIA and all the criminals in the world in the last five years: catching a criminal and leaving him with the fair revenge of the bosen Muslims.
It is so against the logic of film creation that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
This condemns the fact that Karadaz and Mladić are still free, and is suspected by the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally uniform) that they do not have to pursue sufficiently intense persecution on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will attack us with the famous Brecht's poem.
In it it is the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work table by writer: "I look with compassion at the confounded veins on the forehead, note: how hard it is to be evil."
In films like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly such an intrusive head, but suggest how powerful it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the theme of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, this newspaper said that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were very failures.
The only one can be added: no good film about South Africa has ever been filmed.
Almost always applies: When the star roams around the crisis area or passes through the minefield, it will be made as a Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the border break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamten with Leonard DiCaprie.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, they had to run tens of years before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler list.
Many of the film has to be done - films that are now considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "Lovec jelenů", "Apocalypse" or "Oluvní vests" - were not celebrated at any time as a masterpiece.
But we may know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the scriptures do not have the ability, which is necessary to unquestionably address the good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "big dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime has really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcasticly measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked for a parallel between his historic novel "Lemprir's dictionary" and "Balkan War", he said: "The likeness is only that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests criticism for the olympic dissolution of the olympics
The Mayor's withdrawal from organizing summer Olympic games in Hamburg has struck a violent criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
But Von Beust is encouraging realism in the estimate of chances.
The Chief Trade Chamber Executive Officer in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday, marked this decision "in terms of business being unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened the city as much motivation as an Olympic thought.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sportically political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz invited the Senate not to bury this project, but created a new long-term concept for him, "which comes from a changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his earlier predictions, according to which Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least non-realistic by 2028.
"No Hamburg, but the German Olympic sports union will decide the Olympic Chancellor", said von Beust to WLT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union would decide on the Munich Chancellor for the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preferences for us means we have no realistic chance of having a time plan of 2028."
Yet this dream is not yet over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg sports union (HSB) identified von Beust's comments as regrettable.
They'll be impressed that Hamburg doesn't want to get away with the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too soon to destroy your chance by calling the early stage buried," said President HSB, Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The conflict would be contrary to the statement made by the Head of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Union.
Von Beust here candidature of Hamburg at Universidad in 2015 as a substitute for the organisation of Olympic Games.
In the past week, Hamburk’s college sports union was nominee for a candidate city.
The SPD fraction in the Hambour Chamber of Senate has concluded that it wastes valuable time that could be used for the construction of apartments in Hamburg.
"Vývoj region Klein Grassbrook was stopped by the Senate for years because he was betting on the organisation of the Olympics and building the flats," said the SPD Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook area was still planning an olympic with the fact that the whole area will later be used for housing, the CDU unintentionally placed on the "Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games generated great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg crashd in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the expressions of Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but on Ike.
Or is it?
The wooden crates currently produced in Sweden are based on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm are falsified.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, internal research of the Modern Muset Museum in Stockholm comes from the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Modern Museet museum gave a gift to its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as is most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a motivating, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden crates, which were based on red-momped paper box of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 demonstrated - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't artistic works, it was their foreword, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol probably also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Moderna Museet.
These witnesses are now talking about fifteen boxes that were rightly entered the art and auction history as an authorized original - "Andy Warholly Brillo Boxy" with the name of Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was produced and exposed to approximately 100 crates which Warhol left behind.
In fact, 105 Hulténých beden was produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their pastal boards were painted with basic color and peeled, were printed with oil white.
On the contrary, it appeared from the structure of the 1990 copies that the color was made without the previous basic coating by painting role directly on the glassboard - in addition it is acrylic and not oil color.
"The boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," said director Modern Museet, Lars Nitve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authority Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, Modern Muset will have to have six boxes of his exhibition collections classified as "exposition material - copies".
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "serious charges" that were raised in the case of a box of soap powder will be dealt with.
Still, the organization continues to be silent.
Reliable soldiers in Manile surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers gave up to stand in one hotel in Manila and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The commander of the rebels Antonio Trillanes, who was evicted by the president of manipulation and corruption in elections, told the reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
