The members of the Flesh Assembly are concerned that they will "be like Mupeti"
Some members of the Flesh Assembly are constructed from the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the assembly at the Velšský Parliament.
Assembly members across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause laughter.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that "it's working with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Velian twp, it means stupid and pwp means poop.
On the other hand, Plaid said that the group "not happy" as a whole and proposed alternatives.
Velšský Conservative said that his group was following a change in the name “open mind” but noted that MWP had close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘in’ is referred to as the letter ‘u’ in York.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation for amending the name, said: “The final decision on what members of the Flesh Assembly will be called will, of course, be at the members themselves.”
The Law of the Government of 2017 gave the Flesh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public advice on proposals, where it received a broad support option to call the Assembly of the Grand Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the variant of MWP gained the greatest support in the public discussion.
Members of the Assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus can bring the concerns of the President of Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the proposal for a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians go to vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will change to "Republic of North Macedonia".
Every vote should be solved tens of years of dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to the Greek territory and repeatedly protest against the application for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is the opponent of the plebiscity to change his name, declared that he would not follow the vote.
The referees of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, that the change of name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be quiet because the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The people I spoke to say that he was earlier on every corner of the bar and the church," says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
The disappearance of bars is understandable to him.
"The people today face another way," he says.
"Bars are no longer living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and later or later will be exactly where they began.”
As it adds, the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with flats full of such a type of people who don't help other saints in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these homes will be white,” he says, “and that is why the day will soon come when these churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments become members of the churches.”
Both churches built a white congregation before the Harlem became a black metropole – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin 10 years later.
The original Belarusian Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The building took over the black congregation, whose piety was near.
Sv. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of the retail boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem who refused to employ or increase black people.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building strongly, but when the Pharisees of Father Johnson planned its rebuilding, they ordered a bell-game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called "the call of the poor."
It was called the “cultural treasure” and “unplaced historical instrument” on the bell-game in July.
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first bell tower in the world played by a black musician, Diionisa A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, the story of architects and builders, some of whom called upon the Laicians of the church, others of the Episcopal Diocese, took place at St. Martin's.
The Governing Council of the elders, the governing body of the parishes, consisting of lacé representatives, sent a letter in July, expressing the concern that the debate “will try to take up costs” on the council of the elders, although the acquisition of architects and builders which the director sent was not involved.
Some of the priests complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Diocese.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old boy in California who suffered for lobster.
According to the official report, the shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy in California for lobster on the day of the launch of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 o'clock in the vicinity of Beacon's Beach in Eninitas.
Chad Hammel said the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then fell to him with the whole group to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of catching the lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting ‘I was kicked!
He bit me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had a whole area of key bone in his head. ”
“I cried, so that everyone should go out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” Hammel adds.
The boy was taken in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Larry Giles at the press conference said that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was intended not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the hull.
Authorities for investigation and security have closed access to the beach 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the market with cosmetics in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to build chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic alleys in the style of a business home, where specialised sales will be available.
As part of a strong market for cosmetics in the UK, which is worth 2,8 billion pounds and is growing, while fashion sales and home needs are down, the cosmetic streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful next year will expand to further stores.
Investment in cosmetics is associated with the efforts of supermarkets to find applications for regals that have previously been used for television, microwaves and home supplies.
Sainsbury's states that it will double the size of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and, for the first time, indicate brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space gets an existing range from the brand L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, thanks to branded places similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also reiterates its range of Boutique make-up, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two stores, Saintsbury’s will test the concession of the retailer Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and next year it will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping over the Internet and moving towards everyday shopping of a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
General Manager Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like business houses, because the chain of supermarkets tries to offer better services and non-food products to fight discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of units of Argos sales and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. This increased food sales and acquisitions are so much more profitable.
The previous attempt to reschedule the department with cosmetic and pharmacies range ended in unfamiliar terms.
At the beginning of the Millennium Sainsbury’s, the merger was tested by a joint venture with Boots, but it ended after a fight for the distribution of income from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold three years ago his 281 pharmacies to Celesio, which owns the pharmacies of Lloyds.
Lloyds has to play his part in the plan by adding to four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all the needs and a pleasant environment and the favourable location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "wildered" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for £11 million
Dragons Day Peter Jones' star after Holly Willoughby's TV moderator stepped away from a contract worth $11 million with his lifestyle brand so that she can concentrate on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and accessories for Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the brand Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The seventy-year-old host of the show announced the exit to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has developed the star of Dragons Day Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business – to concentrate on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones "wilded" when a TV star in a tight Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that, due to a new contract, up to £1.5 million, they will no longer be able to pay enough time for their branded home clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When seventy-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram that Truly was leaving, Jones went out of Britain to one of his summer mansions.
The following source states: “Treaty’s dream was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would provide her for several decades.
Its decision to leave all interested parties has completely shocked.
No one on Tuesday could believe what's going on, the launch was so close.
The center in Marlow is full of warehouse goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of moderators of the show This Morning, which belongs to the most high British stars, could cost the company millions due to a bold investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and possible delay in marketing.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and two-a-a-a-a-year-old Jones joined in March as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Couples go on vacation, and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Anta McPartlin in modifying the I'm and Celebrity series on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business affairs. ”
The difficult actions “and then we fell in love”
He was joking about the criticism that he would get from journalists as a remark that some consider to be “an unfamiliar president” and for how positive they were talking about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “voiceful” voice.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore, Trump appreciated a great step towards North Korea’s denuclarisation, Kim was interested in further meetings.
But dealings on the destruction of nuclear weapons are dead.
For more than three months after June in Singapore, a major North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, told the world leaders at the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea from the USA does not see a "corresponding response" to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US continues sanctions aimed at raising pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were at the edge of the war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, have produced positive results – completion of rocket tests, assistance in liberating hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their country.
And prevented his unusual access to information about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like the president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of here to get into this mastery arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump and showed on the crowd in front of us.
The waves of tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
In a situation after the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs have learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lomboku have been expelled from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a little demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children, although he's putting together a team to travel to Palu, it's not clear yet if foreign personnel can work here.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency Mr Sutupo said that the Indonesian activists assess the situation in Paul in order to find out whether international organisations will be able to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still unpunished with the wrath of Mother Nature.
At Acehu, shelters have been built against tsunami, but on other parts of the coast, it's not common at all.
The obvious lack of siren warnings in Paul against the tsunami, probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was given.
Even at best, travelling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that anchored in Lombok and assisted the victims of earthquakes is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days to get to the scene of the new calamite.
The improvement of poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodoa's election campaign and the President spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will re-elect for his election, but his government will provide for a loss of funding.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accept more conservative forms of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already requested more than thousands of people's lives and dozens of thousands of people have driven out of their homes.

The number of victims of the tsunami wave in Indonesia increased to 832
As on Sunday morning, the Indonesian disaster office, the number of victims of earthquakes and tsunami waves came up to 832.
Earthquakes hit 7.5 degrees on Friday, triggered waves of up to 6 metres high and arrested many people in the ruins of broken buildings, said the press conference spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The town of Paul, with over 380 thousand inhabitants, was met by the ruins of the broken buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of being stabbed by a woman.
This morning, a female body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched an investigation into the murder.
A woman of 44 years of age with stab wounds was found at 7.55 hours on Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police called on people around who saw something or heard them come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “The investigation is only in the beginning, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was moving near John Street in Birkenhead and to see or hear anything suspicious about us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi driver whose onboard cameras could record something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesmen confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the crime scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
The police have told us there is an investigation and now they are informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one could go into the building or out of it.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't able to say anything.
Now, the residents have learned that it will take a few hours to get home.
One man told a cop that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman on the scene.
She keeps saying, "this is terrible."

In closed areas there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone should have any information, can send a message to @MerPolCC, call on line 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers organization at number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247, 30.9.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit because of the argument of "the transcribing of history"
His extortion would be a well-deserved punishment for destroying many of the English cultural and religious artifacts in the style of the Taliban.
But Cromwell Society called the proposal of Mr. Crick 's foolishness' and "the effort to translate history."
President Cromwell Society John Goldsmith notes: “In the current debate on the removal of sculpture, it was inevitable that one of the goals would become Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't run or run an iconoclasmus in English civil war.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent work of Cromwell, the author of which is Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century view and part of the history of the figure, which many think that they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “ Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than the end of the 19th century, to protect Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unscrupulous historical debates.
Of course, the conflict in the mid 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identified character that represents one side of this division.
His success in the function of Lord Protector is also worth the celebration and reminder."
The killer pig tore up the Chinese farmer
According to local media information, there was an attack and killing of a pig farmer on the market in South-East China.
As in Sunday, the daily South China Morning Post, a man who was only named ‘Yuan’ was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood not far from the bread on the market in Liou-pchan-shui in the province of Kuej-cha.
Pigs rearing the vaccine to pigs in swine on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, China, is prepared to apply the vaccine to the pigs in swine.
Apparently, on Wednesday, with his cousin from Jün-nan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found out that the door to the next-door was open.
According to him, there was a big pork with a blood fat in it.
According to the information provided by forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig of the farmer had broken up.
“Brother had his legs all bloody and broken,” quoted Guiyang Evening News cousin, entitled “Wu”.
The security footage shows how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 440 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Enving News that the pig was closed so that no one else could think of anything else when the police at the crime scene collected evidence.
Market officials are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, the press attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts and the men critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig got the Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him away to a farmer's wife.
After the Armenian farmer ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitby told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “poofer”.
“Just playing.
They're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
The hurricane Rosa, according to predictions, is weakening and moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, but in northern Mexico, and in the southwest of the United States, it will bring flood rain.
At 5 am East Time, Rosa reached 137 km/h wind speed, which represents a hurricane category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, when Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will form a tropical storm and starts pushing tropical humidity north into the western part of the USA.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
The tropical humidity then, with the approaching low pressure ban in the coming days, causes massive rain in the southwestern United States.
The reduction of 25 to 100 mm locally causes dangerousval floods, sutium currents and possible soil drains on the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause the rainfall to be closer to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly worsening conditions, floods may occur due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
Given the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very vague to walk into the desert.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to become white rivers, and storms will bring locally impacting winds and dust flying.
The approaching low pressure blizzard will bring strong local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
There may be a total drop over 13 mm, which could cause smaller streams of sutin and silhouette wagons.
It will be the first drop in the rain season in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, Arizona will begin to draw closer to the unique tropical crossovers and on Monday night and on Tuesday the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, a strong rain will spread to the four corners and will last until the center.
In October we can expect intense changes in temperature throughout the US, because the Arctic begins to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid thermal changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsia.
In the next few days, they will try to expand the incoming summer heat.
In most territories in the middle and east of the United States, a warm start of October is expected with temperatures of around 27 °C from southern plans to part of the north-east of the United States.
There could be 27 °C in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels Thursday's reputable statements of the candidate for the judge of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual attack allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political pathway continued, and the voters interrupted the current programs with reports on the sudden fifth revolution: an agreement that was directed by the Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake, that the FBI would carry out a one-day investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the Chamber Court that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drinking at the high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen are likely to have followed the event.
The company counted on average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The figures for other stations that sent out notices such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at offices.
Compared to, it's similar to the number of viewers who watch football games in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations when Nielsen observed him during a full day's hearing on average of 5.69 million viewers.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had CZK 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest continued even after the negotiations were over.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this dying Republican announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught them screaming at him when he was going to take the elevator to the hearing of the jury.
CNN transmitted lively, as he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, and had him do it.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power while many women are powerless. ”
Flake said his office made a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later live on when the jury was to vote for the presentation of the Kavanaugh nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if he investigated the FBI by next week's candidate charge, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced her friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an investigation into the FBI's accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of being "politicist" with regard to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview for Sunday Times, accused the critics of leaving the European Union that the "politicians" concerning the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose each other's duties is "excusable".

The department would like to thank the police unit for the refugees of the State of Louisiana, the CSI state police, the Southern University police, and the local citizens for helping in the investigation that led to arrest.
The sports director LSU Joe Alvela thanked local policemen for the "quiet and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 on foot for the match.
Basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death by a team "breathed" and "scoffed" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcanob cane on Mexico City
The ash that is boiling from the volcano Popacatépetl has hit the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The national disaster prevention centre in Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the Vulcan activity increased and in 24 hours, 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded.
The Centre followed a number of storms and shocks.
Social nets showed images of frontal cars covered by a thin layer of ash in some quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shrouded by central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met the Catalan Separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence met with the order police and thousands of people joined a competitive demonstration on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which divided Catalonia.
Superintendents blocked a group of masked separatites who threw eggs and powder paints after them, the ones on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, the border had also leaked, to which the police had to use footwear.
In a few hours, independent groups sang "We will not forget," in the face of protesting union supporters who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured in protests.
One year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the Separatist Catalans celebrate it, the tension remains high in the independence region.
The voters voted for independence most of the time, but the participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the dissipation boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent clashes throughout the region tried to end the vote in the electoral rooms.
The independence support groups remained out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations from supporting the national police.
Although the demonstration took place, it had to choose another route.
The eight-year-old electricist Narcis Termes, who participated with the wife in the separatist protest, said he was no longer hoping to gain independence for Catalan.
“ Last year, we had some of the best moments.
My parents were glad to vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite an important, although a tight victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan party in support of independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or are waiting in custody for the referendum organisation and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig's 20-year-old monteries recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and says that the conflict had stirred up politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more intense," she adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"The European elections are the best way to condemn the fall in democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after the crash of a car home

At one point, someone shot the car out of the basket, too.
Mengova hit secured Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston, who went from the lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The hit on Dolly Mengy turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team of this season has no victory in the Premiership League at the guests' playground and the first Hearts will be built next Sunday, which will lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston has spread a number of games without defeating six games, so the Chief Coach Holt, who scored Kenny Miler last month, hasn't tried the defeat.
Livingston did not take chances against the unimaginable guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he didn't succeed in the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slide just missed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
Home enough to watch Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could be in trouble with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against Rangers was laid free kick and Livingston created a crack, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Meng, who shot and scored the ball in the middle of the penthouse area.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball holding, but the house defense for them was invincible and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly didn't have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped his legs as goalkeeper Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not run from another standard Livingston situation.
Livingston's penitentiary areas were constantly flying the centers that the players kept cleaning, and two penalts came into the penaltary area – after Halket's attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another hand.
“Fenomén” from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macarooni Arena stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their game style and the team haven't changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, he was doing a great defense while Menga was keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the emergency room all along.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but these standards are no longer up.
Their end was lame – only once penetrated on the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call, because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan caught up with a mixed hug in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (29 September) at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smile.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, whose aim is to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
They have not agreed for a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and the adoption of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population out of Turkey in this city.
The police for security reasons prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from meeting before the Mosque, but many supporters appeared in the neighborhood who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard – many of them were Kurds – protesters against Erdogan, who judged his politics and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
Residential protests reflect the controversiality of a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
An accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after a encounter with a car
In London, a cyclist died after a collision with a car.
There was an accident at approximately 10:15 a.m. near the Bestwood Street crossroads with the busy street of Evelyn Street in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of Saturday's tragedy in an accident at Childers Street when the driver left the site.
Metropolitan police said that police officers are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
Roads are closed, buses run on replacement routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a male high security prison.
The riots broke out at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still last.
Eight prisoners in one wing were called specialised overseers from the Tornádo team to handle the market.
The doctors suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
He said: “The handling of the ongoing incident in the Long Lartin prison was specially trained prison workers.
Six personnel were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those who are responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the head of the prison ended after an attack in the hospital.
And in October last year, order units were called into prison because of the serious unrest in which the staff was attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City floods (the area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not usual for Arizona to hit the tropical low pressure system, but that's exactly what will happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert south-west and brings a risk of flooding.
National weather service has already issued a warning before the floods Monday and Tuesdays from West Arizona for South and Eastern Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
Phoenix’s national meteorological service on Twitter said that “from 1950, only ten tropical cyclone remained in the distance of 320 km from Phoenix as a tropical storm or pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Center for hurricanes predict the precipitation of 50 to 100 mm in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other desert north-west areas, including the centre of the Skalist Mountains and the Big Pans, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local tops up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, because the area hit dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitation might help somewhere, because the Southwest of the United States just hit dry.
The Weather.com server states that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona’s ‘extremous dry’ is at least the second highest category.
The road of hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore loses its strength.
Mexico is expected to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the precipitation will be strong, which is a high risk of flooding.
‘In the area from Baja California to the north-west Sonoru, the total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm may occur,’ says the server Weather.com.
Rosa then sails as a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday in the morning hours she arrives at Arizona border. Then she passes Arizona, and on Tuesday, she enters South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risks of Rosa or of its remains are expected to be a very strong precipitation in Baja California, the Northwestern Sonar and the desert south-west of the United States," reports the National Center for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause extremely dangerousval floods and sutin streams in deserts and soil sesus in the hot terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after being found stabbed by a 16-year-old in Somerset.
A wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As the police of Avon and Somerset informed, young men aged between 17 and 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
The police are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “has tried the wickedness and anger ” of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a refusal of a carefree and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump to the House of Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh, during the process of his nomination, “he had tried the wicked and the rage of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh reported on Thursday before Congress, where he definitely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's extortion that he attacked her a few decades ago when they were teenagers, sexually.
And Ford told her at the hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, "the Americans were witnessing Kavanaugh's glory and quality and courage."
The intervention of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service at the end.”
The President indirectly attacked Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
“Teach weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still in motion," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said that the Democrats decided to "response and obstruction".
CNN said that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate was expected not later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit large earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which had destroyed huge waves that flooded the beaches.
At the beach in Palu, on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival, but by nightfall the coast hit up to six meters of the waves that many people killed and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
Gradually, there was an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people continued to work on the beach, and they didn't run, so they fell for the victim's waves," said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for the relief of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro's collapse in Jakarta.
“The great tsunami did not go alone, took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on earth,” said Nugroho, and added that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at an open sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled the trees and survived before the wave.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and moss surrounded by water.
As a result, the coastal city and Saturday started.
A series of earthquakes was to feel in the area where they live 2.4 million people.
In its statement, the Indian Technology Evaluation and Applications Agency stated that the energy released by the fifth strong shocks was approximately 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb torn in the Second World War on Hiroshim.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow cove, which could have increased the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described damages as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had broken down.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the cares of broken buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 was missing.
Nugroho informed that the amount of victims and damage may be greater on the coast of 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Donggala, which is near the epicentre of earthquakes.
According to him, the communication was "exalted completely without any information" from Donggala.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300 000 people live in the area, and added that his workers and volunteers are being directed into the affected places.
“It’s tragic, but it might get a lot worse,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the Agency met considerable criticism because it did not inform that Palu had hit the tsunami wave, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time when the warning was issued.
On amateur shots shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of the building is a desperate scream warns people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the coast will hit a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters wasn't able to check the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a large outage of electricity, which interrupted communication in the area of Palu, so the authorities could only be difficult to coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending freight aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
Airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Saturday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where employees hide themselves in shelters from the celts built in the yard of the office building, they saw the paintings of destruction, says Mr Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the help groups began to act sadly to help in disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience could not come to Paula.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, stocks and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to the place of calamities until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross of Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says “OK, this is a national disaster,” we can start international assistance, but this is not yet the case.”
When Paul found the second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing, they still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the cloud stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, paramedics freed a woman who was trapped two days in custody next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Another person trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, was his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon referred to as in the hours followed by the paragliding community, knowing about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate to send messages through WhatsApp competing from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
His texts, but instead of a pair of blue ticks, they ended up with a grey mark.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26 750 during the addition of ATM in Newport on the Left
According to the press release of the police department in Newport, the thieves took out $26 750 a.m. to Brink while filling the ATM on the Levee on Friday morning.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver left the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money in it.
When he did, another man “he ran out from behind the staff of Brink” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put into the ATM.
According to the press reports, several suspects have seen some of the suspects that have fled from the scene, but the police have failed to specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any information on the identity of the suspects in Newport to the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West is changing his name – to Ye.
On Saturday, he reported on Twitter, where he wrote: “The fact that was formally known as Kanye West. ”
The 11-year-old West has been named Ye for a while and the pseudonym used as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new album Yandhi.
In the show, he will replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for “citizen reasons,” as the director of the show said.
West has previously said that the word for him has a religious meaning in addition to shortening the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, the “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, where it means “you”,” he heard West at the beginning of this year when he spoke to Big Boy’s radio moderator about his album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to the mere Ye – as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
The name changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names of Love (love) and Brother Love (brute love).
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also kept his name alternately with and without the conjoint, and with small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that “will never use the army to attack the Mexican people. ”
By the time the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people at peaceful demonstrations in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador committed to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education were going into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
According to an investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
Comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published reports on AI, although the US as a whole do not have any formal strategies for artificial intelligence.
China in the meantime introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be the 1 in innovation AI by 2030.
"The double-up of AI's research budget would be a good start since all other countries are much further away than the US and we're looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in an interview for CNBC that double funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI will be made in the US.
Lee, who published this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, his book “Supervelmocii AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order”, is the CEO of the company Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in Othello, and later he was the head of a researcher of Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee evaluated the previous technology competition of the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic spies don't take China, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been employing the best experts in university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee the United States, changes in immigration policy could also help.
"In my opinion, green cards should be offered to holders of a doctorate in the field of AI," he says.
The China State Council has issued a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organisations handing out money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Defence Department set up a joint Centre for artificial intelligence this year to involve partners in the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it invests $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to NSF, it now invests more than 100 million USD per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not taken place for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum whether they want to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the North Macedonia, which would solve a few decades of an old dispute with Greece that blocks the application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the Northern neighbor is entitled to its territory, and therefore it had the entry of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of most Slovak populations in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign for boycott raised doubts whether there would be at least 50 percent of the voters needed to make a referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the arrival of an agreement with Greece?"
The beneficiaries of the change of name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries of former Yugoslavia, to join the organisation as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament said that they would follow the outcome of the vote.
Change of name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State electoral committee stated that no problems have been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when the vote finally gave up 66 percent of registered voters.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjos Tanevski, a 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their votes in the Macedonian referendum to change the name that would open the country the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the states built by people who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for the servants,” says Kavadarkov.
“We are poor countries, but we are proud.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much necessary investment.
"I think the great majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zava said after he voted out.
The result "yes" would be "to confirm our future".
According to the survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 percent of the voters – less than the required participation.
In another survey organised by Telma TV Macedonian Station, it was found that on Sunday it intends to vote 57 percent.
Of these, 70% stated that they would vote yes.
In order to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must be attached.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since its launch last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has gone for the goal through Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over Brighton's defense on Saturday, thus securing Manchester City win 2-0 at the stadium Etihad in Manchester.
In Aguera administration, his goal seemed ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He's been through three Brighton defenders, and he's in the open space.
And Aguera then surrounded four green dressings.
On the edge of the fine territory of Brighton one defender went over and several others passed.
He found Sterling on his left.
The English attacker put the ball in the penitentiary's territory back to Aguer, who overrun Brighton Mathewa Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot to the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” reported to reporters the manager of City Pep Guardiola.
“ We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that point."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues at this Premier League game but he set up Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
On the left side, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane worked the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
Attacker Sky Blues stole the ball into the network just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim.
Scherer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When Nationals were voted out of the playoff fight, there were many reasons to re-enter.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that he will stand up to the place of a pitcher in a fight against Colorado Rockies – only if they have Rockies who lead in NL West by one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for a playoff.
Rockies had at least a wild card winning 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first degree in the division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least start, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the other team will probably play with the greatest effort I’m going to live this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play it?"
Nationals have not yet reported who will begin Sunday, but reportedly tend to throw Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherra, it would be a 34th start and he would practice Thursday and pitch on Sundays when he's usually free.
Washington's true pitcher has 18-7 statistics in this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strings in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump performed at meetings in West Virginia
The President expressed his view of his candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
“ Everything that we have done will be at stake in November.
One of the most important choices in our lives is five weeks.
It's one of the big, big ones – I don't run, but we're still on the move and I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by means of whatever means they need, you see the wicked, the oditivity.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats decided "response and obstruction".
"And you can see it in the last four days," he added and said that the Democrats are "draged and angry and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned, on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Commission, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud awakening of the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, erm no, wait – it was a really bad body speech – the worst speech I've ever seen."
The Labour side is no longer a diverse reasoning current.
It is intolerant to those who express their views
When Moment's activists voted on my local side for reminding me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of the line of Labourian Members who said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their views.
My fellow Members from the House, Joan Ryan, treated the same way, because anti-Semitism was resolutely built.
In my case, I was criticized by a reminder that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, about Europe, the paradoxically similar issues about which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The notice of Friday's Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that "We want the meeting to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of Parliament for the Labour side were the GC meeting on Friday night exactly like that.
Unfortunately, the majority of meetings today do not run and the promise of “a more gracious, more loving policy” was long ago forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the direction of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, whom I earlier thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected from me to turn around by 180° and to stand positions that I could otherwise agree with – whether it is a national security or a single market for the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't matter what I'm saying – then, there's a great deal of social media addiction that calls for my appeal, condemns the policy of the centre and tells me that I shouldn't be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm better luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those, colleagues who face every day avalanche of sexist or racist insults, but never will.
One of the aspects of this policy era, which I am most disappointed with, is how insults become standard.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer in this diverse opinion stream and with each proposal for mistrust or change of selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised to stay back, not so many times, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which left my general school class literally falling apart, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need them most - whether as a local councilman or Minister of Government.
I've never concealed my policy, nor been in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is taking a stand for Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Of course, my main message is not determined by the Moment in Nottingham, but by my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting on what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Ayr rises to the top
Two late-fives have a little mistooked the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun Tennist's Premiership game.
Now they're at the head of the table, like the only non-stop.
After all, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chances, which helped the home to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have been through great trials and we are still unharmed, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honors of Ayra have taken better than us. ”
Five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climate, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to use numerous numbers and Jason Baggot to win an unaltered five.
Climo increased Ayru's budget and then, exactly at half-time, scored and turned into a solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and five of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then a longer delay due to the severe injury of Ruardha Knott, who left the playground on the stretchers, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowalla, which he changed Climate.
The acting captain of Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose once again used the player in addition due to the unaltered five Bruce Colvine after a short severe pressure.
The house, of course, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking the Climate without the ball, MacPherson of the penalt grade put the ball behind the moving maul Ayru.
Climo changed, again from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home five.
Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of Still Game Ford Kieran is moving to the field of hospitality. It turns out he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, who writes and plays along with Greg Hemhill's long-time comedy partner.
The twines have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the official register, Adriftmorn Limited is the Director of the company.
The actor refused to comment, but Scottish Sun’s daily source indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “sperious business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Navy patrol before the La Paz Navy headquarters, which is decorated with ropes.
There's a blue flag in the ocean color above the public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described as Password: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty."
Throughout the inland Bolivia, there is still a live memory of the coast that the country lost in favour of Chile in a bloody war of resources in the 19th century – just like the desire to re-abuse the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the largest in several decades, because Bolivia is waiting for decisions of the international court, which should fall on 1st October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, spirit unity and peace, and, of course, expects a positive result,” says Roberto Calzadilla’s Bolívia diplomat.
Many Bolivias will follow MSD decisions on large screens across the country with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that – after decades of interrupted talks – Chile is required to act on the fact that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic native President of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle to re-elect next year – has also a great interest in Monday's decision.
“We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,” said he at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely for the court to decide in the favor of Bolivia – and even if it had happened, it would not have changed much.
This UN authority, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign to someone of the Chinese territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes only six months after the last arguments, shows that the case “was not complex,” as Paz Zárate says, a Chinese expert on international law.
And for the last four years, not only did they not support Bolivia's thing, but maybe they took it off more.
"The question of access to the seas has been taken by the current Boltish government," says Zarate.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric weakened all the rest of Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries haven't changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a special opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if the US can't believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm up its nuclear weapons first unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to make promises on the sum of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck on a dead end for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that “the hope ” is that the ongoing sanctions and objections of the US against the declaration of the end of Korean war could sometimes be hit by a North on its knees.
Washington is careful about consenting to the declaration if Pjongjang does not first make significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and president of the U.S. Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general skepticism that Pjongjang thinks seriously that this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' show shows that your fashion stores will soon reach the latest trend of huge headgears
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of big head covers for their spring/year 2019 collection at the show which took all of them to Paris's fashion week.
Instagram flooded very unobtrusive hats this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creation to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was an overextended beige hat with a wide margin of feathers that flooded the head of models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated with melons, a witch hat and even ananas – but are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature reminded the diver's equipment and the snorkel and the glasses, while another looked like a corroborating with the ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also come to fashion stores.
The big hats come after the "La Bomba", a straw with half a meter wide cream, which everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very unobtrusive hat, which flooded the social media, sent to the showroom another huge creation – a sweet beach bag, which is almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that carries it.
The dark orange rafi bag covered with rafi cherries and equipped with white leather sleeves was a fashion play by La Riviera spring/lét 2019 from Jacquemus on Paris week.
The Stylist of Celebrate Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given that the designer has had such a great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have followed a number of academic achievements, and this also continues with other excellent test results in 2018. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, they are represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (The Scottish Council of Independent Schools – SCIS) and are trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best level of services.
Independent schools are preparing their pupils for further and higher education, the career they chose, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school learning plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a language that he understands, it goes right into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes right into his heart."
This is an important point that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that the languages are first on the table, with independent schools not increasing their success rate.
A total of 68 percent of pupils learning foreign language achieved best grades A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects that pupils choose are equally respected in study plans of independent and other schools as STEM objects (knowing, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for reasons which employers indicate as problems in the exercise of their jobs, accounts for 17 percent of the inadequate language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential when preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more and more work opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in the globalised world.
Whether you choose a career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such a lifelong skill.
Due to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages automatically receives advantage from competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013, between 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak foreign language well enough to allow for conversation, with the only language that spoke two-point percent of people, namely 15%, was French.
That's why it's important for today's children to invest in language teaching.
If the children know more languages, especially the languages of the emerging economies, they will have a greater chance to find meaningful employment.
Every school is different from what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important for Great Britain in view by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whether the child is interested in anything, he will always have a choice in independent schools from several languages with teachers in the field of expertise.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and share skills that are needed to succeed, whatever is expected in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so they must reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘national communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and significance to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself to the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James first coming to Los Angeles Lakers will be able to wait soon.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening match in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told Lakers on the official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-Series.
“In this phase of my career, I don’t need pre seasoning matches,” he said.
Trump's gig in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is going to start a campaign performance at Wheeling in West Virginia tonight.
It's the first of five mains scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a free seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, since the Republicans are in November elections against the risk of losing Congress.
At what time of tonight's Trump's show begins and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 East Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's City in West Virginia you can follow online through live transmission to YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about a hearing from a candidate at the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week, and it was very tight about the accusation of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be delayed a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wafer is to help the Republicans to take the pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trumpa's campaign organizers say that these five meetings next week aim at adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect themselves and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
"The debate on the Senate is so important for his agenda that the President will go to this busy season of campaigns to as many states as possible," said Agent Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could come from the "Ohi and Pennsylvania" to watch the media from Pittsburgh today.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia in which he received more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisy, who's in reconnaissance.
“For Morris, the president must come to help him in his surveys,” says the Reuters political scientist at the Simon Haeder University of Wester.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown its stomach to fight to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's pairs can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely elaborate sport concept, but the players really believe him, and most of all at such competitions.
So where does the pendulum go now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum probably moves a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, leading by four points, and there are 12 left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played all day together, and everyone can boast three points of four.
Spieth was deadly when he moved from the launch to the green and he was an example.
Celebratory screams have increased in the continuation of his bike, when he managed a key base to win the whole match when Tomas and I were two holes behind.
His putt, who won their 15-hole match, met with a similar scream that tells you the American team isn't out yet.
“You really had to go deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, unquestionably the main story of Ryder cup.
Strange, but adorable couples from Europe are four of four, and they can't prove anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't run out of jam on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way the energy flows towards a turbulent audience, and it confirms from him that these are players of the destination for Sunday victory, and that by the sunset of the Le Golf Naitional will not be the most popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's the best both of them for a different hole at the same time.
However, talk about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have briefly cooperated with Sergi Garcí, the hero of the morning game by four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and two devils on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in the abyss they no longer came out of.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
The two games for two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interaction between people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better so far as a team, and until the last day it has taken a significant lead, but this game of two pairs has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting, which some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cupu leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday's double games to two balls came out with a pulley of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspiring dueo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over the fighting Tiger Woods, decided to do four quakes in Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated two balls with the American side that failed in series 3-1.
The US has shown more resistance in four, won two matches, but they couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furika's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 games to keep her trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points behind, while he and Molinari, who, after the weekend of the sensation, got the nickname "Molliwood", are just the second couple to win four points from their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then smoothly beat the tired Woods and the American newbie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliantness, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in the game of pairs to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game for two balls, returned to partner Henri Stenson in the game of doubles at 2-1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - the Ones and Threes in the World ranking.
Europe, however, did not have it in this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris, won on the entire line.
The three-fold Jordan Spieth's top winner and Justin Thomas have been taken for the Americans on Saturday two points.
They won a rough 2–1 victory over the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the Poulter couple and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of pairs, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-point game, although the defense of Fury's side needs only a tie to get the trophy.
After the next day was the best in two days, it seems that there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that "in no way" will not be armed unilaterally and without trust
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that the UN continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had adopted "a significant measure of goodwill" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to be unilaterally disarmed."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints regarding the resistance of Washington to the “serious” approach to denuclarization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject the unalteral denuclarisation only because Pjongjang had passed through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim committed to working on the "denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the formal termination of the war conflict from 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted the challenges of releasing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “denuclerisation first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force its targets and even oppose “the declaration of the end of war”” said Ri.
“I think sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is, the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the United Nations this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclarisation was South Korea and not the US, the deuclarisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a path."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from that last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the US territory is inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim "raket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in UN Trump, who threatened to "total destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that many work and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclerized.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for it, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue in good shape and without stopping until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclarization”
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and the ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party and Pompeo declared that he would visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
Pjongyang left July and stated that progress had been made just to say in a few hours that North Korea was upsetting the “gangster requirements”.
North Korea has committed itself to meeting Moon in this month to disassemble the missile area and also a nuclear complex, if the United States adopts "correct measures".
He said that Kim announced that "corresponding measures" in which he hoped were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and led towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course to teach them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allowed all of his students to sleep more, in an effort to fight against the growing culture of macho studies throughout the night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self - care.
Kurz suggested Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and the female hospital, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep-deprivement on learning.
“ At the end one girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me now, in my last year?’
She said no one's ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits assist academic and athletic performances and improve their overall comfort.
Paul Barreira, professor of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were really sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One part is the picture of student tracks, where students click on a cup with coffee, curtains, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how the athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed about how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that there is a problem of lack of sleep as well.
A sufficient amount of sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said - even so that there is no collection, because sleepy depression turns the brain into hunger regime, so you are still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler propose a course that last year during her first year at Harvard attended one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the course.
He hopes that the next step will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for a time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can blow up your circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga sinked Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
On page Ibrox tried to record her first victory from February 4 to 1st, the triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers lineup seemed inspired and determined to settle.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs third and right behind team Hibernian, unlike one goal.
And there could be further problems with the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence had to be treated with head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that drove past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, which took point Hearts last week, and would be pleased to see how his well-trained man suffocated his opponent for every step.
Rangers may have handled the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only going to score two minutes after the beginning when Menga first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup man buried his big chance.
The far free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the rear.
Rangers took over, but it seemed there would be more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a four-hour penalty mark when Steven Lawless got hit, but the judge Steven Thomson broke the Colombian call from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots to target in the first half, but Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassany Coulibala's head and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could've been against the game after 34 minutes, no one could deny that they deserved it already for the hard work.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield wasn't responding when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cool and picked up Meng for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing collapsed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fought from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind they like, when Lithgow and Halkett metal by one long ball after another.
Holt's party could have deepened its lead in final stages, but McGregor was well built to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton was entitled to another late sentence when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now a page from our almanac " Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still being added... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's numerator.
At that time, Geiger Counter was also a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950’s “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of those seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is it?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s computer that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms with radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans: "Oh, yeah, he's really in it right now!"
Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that carries his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction and conversion of immune cells from the patient in the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they can reinitiate
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells, passed the cancer of the ovaries for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” common protein in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-instituted into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "has grown several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells were collected from patients and “study” to focus on cancerous cells was promoted in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West took part in pro-truspov preaching, in his epa cap, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was turned off at the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised President Donald Trumpa and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a head of Make America Great Against, he began spitting on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“ I often talk to white people, and they say: “How can you like Trump? Is he racist?
If I'd minded racism, I wouldn't have been in America much longer," he said.
The SNL launched a show parody with Matt Damon in the lead role where Hollywood stars were making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate committee on rape by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the shots of West's theater speech were recorded on social media by Commie Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to mock West.
West also complained to the viewers that he had had a pretty good head decoration at eating behind the scenes.
“In the back of the scenes, I was bullyed.
They said, "Don't go up there with that hat."
It's a bully!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and he added that “he would wear his superman suit because it means you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were earned only by a drum of the audience at least twice, and SNL members looked worse, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: “The entire studio has completely been quiet.”
West was invited as a late replacement for a singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song of I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West has received support from a leading conservative group of TPUS, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: Thank you, SES POSTAVIL DAVU.”
But the visiting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was simply who he is, and that is absolutely amazing.”
“But I will convert NECHCI to someone (the purchase of his music or his clothing or through the promotion of his “artition”) that I believe represents and send to the world of ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Like us," she added.
Before the rapper performance, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and goes in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

Game Thrones Star Kit Harington has gone into toxic masculinites
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype of macho heroes and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claiming to earn their respect.
New news The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was speaking strongly about this problem.
“ At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly, what happened to the masculinite so bad?" he said.
"What do we teach a teenage man about the problem we're seeing here now?"
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for rising toxic manhood thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What are the boys learning on TV, on the streets, from them growing the feeling that every man needs to have such a side?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do you change that?
Because I'm sure a young man has changed to worse.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Games about thrones after completion of the series because he had enough of "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in the restored Right West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best thing that came from the Throne Games.
"I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my future family and my entire life," he said.
Rose played Ygritt, the object of the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series with the award of Emma.
A couple took place in June 2018 on Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China shows 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected by this virus according to official numbers.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally HIV is spread through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who infected HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese healthcare professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
Transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT against people is reported to be still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from lack of sexual protection in these fields.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to treating HIV as part of its efforts to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denyes that personnel would have escaped the GOP data of senators, set aside the terms of “safe lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters argued that a member of her staff had posted personal data from three Republican Senators of America for the legislator's wikiistes.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by “ultrapravic” scientists and websites.
“The lie, lies, and other detestable lies,” Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information reported included home addresses and telephone numbers for American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and an unknown person published it on Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on sexual abuse charges by a candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
At times, information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that sources of contributions is linked to Waters' office and published information on the members of Waters' staff, says Hill.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lie,” Watters continued.
"The members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were, as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - were not in any way responsible for the release of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned an online criticism, including from the former White Secretary of the House of Ari Fleischer.
“This burns is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that there is no temperament for being a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be obsessive.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and not be excited."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' response with the criticism of the Democrats towards the Kavanaugh judge who criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the elections against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that her office indicated “the competent authorities and the authorities involved in the criminal proceedings on these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all of my staff."
Johnny English re-emergences reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new movie with British tendency, which seems to be the case of this reanimation of Johnny English in the series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this sterling satir on the subject, as obviously the bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to re-paint things in a completely new way - that name more than any other signal that is a wide comic work designed for an unangelically speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau, a speck of Mr. Bean and a great piece of that guy who has suffered the only tone in the band Chariots of Fire on the Celebration of Olympic Games in London 2012.
The figure is also originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV ads Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this last edition, there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English, as he approached the helicopter in the medieval armor and blade of the rottor shortly quenched about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite subdivided and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being directed to children than adults, and for me are the crazy tramps of Johnny English as resourceful and concentrated as Atkinson's quiet movie gagas in the person of Mr. Bean.
It is a long-term assumption that Britain has serious problems.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British field operatives to the appallment of an agent in service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a prime minister who's a pumping-up character who's already suffering under a complete collapse of political inviolence: Emma Thompson's favorite Theresa May character plays the best, but there's no power in the script.
Her newsletters tell her that once every active spy is in danger, she'll have to return someone from retirement to work.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but also gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: there are some nice gagas, because English offers a spy academy similar to school rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency break and met with his former long- suffering partner Bough, who once again played Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the submarine, an effective figure on which Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be a little waste.
So Batman and Robin, breaking down tasks for Her Majesty's secret services, are back in action, and they're meeting with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, which Olga Kurylenko played.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technological millionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their oyseu full of frackish patalis: masked as waiters will burn the French restaurant; they will create chaos when they sneak on the deck Voltov luxury yachts; and English will trigger pure anarchy when they attempt by using virtual reality to get to know with the interior of Voltov's house.
I'm sure all the essays are ready for this last sequence, but be it self-loving and turbulent, it's got some kind of baby TV in it.
Quite a moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowon Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to workers, which will come from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still have the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would be "fit" into the party's economic agenda and are planning to direct the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by Congress of trade unions as a way that workers can use changing economies.
A long-term Labourer member said to Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It does not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that fits the position of the party to balance the economy in favour of both the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this inspiration is currently not approved by the Labourist Party as a whole.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated that he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “signs” in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies do not need to return to their total share, because the Labour Government could make a "reduction" on the basis of the alleged fault.
He also confirmed the plans to place workers in the management board of the company and create equity funds that will give 10 % of the equity to private enterprises who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the series "60 minutes," if FBI Kavanaugh's investigation could have changed their mind.
The FBI investigation of the prosecution against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the Office could hit some Republican senators in the campaign to support them.
In an interview from Sunday "60 minutes" the correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, to see if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's decision, however, is irritable.
"I've already made my decision under Brett Kavanaugh, and it would really mean explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the ones she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything change."
What is Global Citizens Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival annual music event will take place, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission behind the end of the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which was mentioned in 2012, is an extension of the Global Pontia project, an international group to support the end in poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, an e-mail to the world leader, a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand an event, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that they sign online petitions or that they leave tweet will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by his supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the world leaders notifying commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion, which have more than $2.25 billion in life by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British Partnership of Investors and Realists who committed to “help children grow into their full potential”, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end up in the region after receiving more than 4 700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make only a note in history from social injustice in the form of malnutrition,” the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called on U.K. to improve nutrition for mother and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking questions, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall down and we will fail.
But as well as the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moonae is one of the new York's most effective winners of Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use a "block Navy" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent the entry into the markets of Russian energy, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to promote energy as much as in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The connected states have the opportunity to make sure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organised by the consumer energy alliance, which is a non-profit group that is referred to in the US as a 'consumption of energy'.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were practically the same.
“Economic options for Iran and Russia are more or less an investment in or replacement for fuel,” he said, and at the same time referred to Russia as “one-purpose” players with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trumpa’s officials, including President Donald Trumpa himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unavoidable” project of Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a“rukom” Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $111 billion, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion sqm, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s zealous resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has taken a position from Germany, who has re-affirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry, the Federation of Germany (BDI), invited the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “be close to looking” at the Presidential candidature in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the election in the middle of the election period, "not close to looking" at the President's candidacy.
During the Hall meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the candidacy.
“It is time for women to come to Washington and correct our broken government, including the top female position,” she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look closely at the presidential candidature."
Warren mentioned Donald Trumpa during the meeting and said that "is leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I fear until the plague of the bone of what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism Trumpa and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course, we need an investigation by the FBI before the vote.”
However, the publication published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support candidature.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's runt, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other highly built democratic names, which were mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy until 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he was going to decide officially in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through after his return can concern other families who suffer the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning to," she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the word in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “they are returning a little different, returning to comfort, coming back and asking if there is respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and flyers and every other member of the army are giving to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunkness, said Dan Bennett, spokesperson of police department Wasilla.
18 States, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteenteen states and District of Columbia support the legal call for a new measure of the U.S. government, which denies asylum victims from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the period of Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and to question this measure, stated NBC.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Session case, which, in August, submitted to the American Civil Liberties Organisation against federal politics, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang ” had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States as nations facing all sorts of gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States returned the decision of the 2014 liberator's Board of Appeal, which allowed illegal immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Prosecutor Karl Racine of D.C. stated in the Friday statement that the new measure "is ignoring the decade of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” said a short friend.
The lawyers further argued briefly that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants would damage the US economy and says that it is more likely that entrepreneurs would become and "require necessary work".
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered judges in the area of immigration not to give asylum any more to victims who are fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or for political reasons," said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to mitigate all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has doubled, race to search for survivors with time
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tight,” said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, who comforted her hot little boy in the evacuation center in the desert city of Palu.
“An ambulance will bring other bodies every minute.
Pure water is rare."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking themselves through wet things and trying to save anything they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested with Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe subsequent shocks.
His words filled his eyes with the feeling that the violent earthquake shaked his hotel room on the fifth floor, sharing peace with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," said Haris for the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife calls for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador blames China on "skanking" commercial advertising
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page advertisement in the American daily, dedicated to the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday's payment to China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to blend in the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get into the US elections, marked what the American officials said that Reuters was the new phase of an escalating campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to conduct commercial promotion advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that appears at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese retaliation sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's republican party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion on Sunday Des Moines Register, that China is now doubled by the fact that it publishes propaganda advertising in our own free press."
“When spreading its propaganda, the US government uses a valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"As opposed to the news stand on Beijing, you will find limited disapproval votes and you will not see a real reflection of the unfamiliar views that the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic path, since the media belong to the company "China Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans leave their vote before the election for the debacle with Kavanaugh, warning the analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Chief Judge Brett Kavanauga, who is facing several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that during the next elections in the middle of the period they will recognise the response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted the fact that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) in the last few moments of seeking an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters would "The November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the hallway of the Senate, where Republicans who are responsible for the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"The people say it's already been high, that's true."
This could, however, be higher, especially among women’s weighing voters in suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years who do not like the president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which is detailed in his accusation of sexual assault on the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, they would follow the opposition.
“It was a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote in committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans did and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, the Head of the US priority group, which helps vote Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided into the opinion that they trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more sympathy for the other appointed ones.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents have definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony while 35 percent said that they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake FBI's assault, he currently investigates the charges of Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate courtroom under oath last week that Kavanaugh's drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the High Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his college at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web invention is planning to start a new internet and beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the invention of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source platform of Berners-Lee, called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the objective of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
"We have to do this now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that enables people to create their own "personal online data storage" or TU.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like the Drive Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all simultaneously.
What is special on the personal online storage of data is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to which kind of information.
This is called "personal authorisation through data."
According to John Bruce’s CEO, Inrupt’s purpose is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees working on the project have cooperated with the project and the community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google don’t talk about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In his contribution to the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that by sending the project Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this other era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A spiritual celebration received during World War I by Viktoriin Cross
A hundred years since the only spiritual Church of England has won Victoria’s cross as a warrior during World War I.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Bellenglis and Lehaucourt Award on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, the sniper killed him and he never knew he had received the highest military prize.
His two grandkids showed him a memorial stone at the Rushden parade on Saturday.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was "genically symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's winning act.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, underpants Lt Col Vann led his battle through Canal de Saint-Quentin's very dense fog and strong shooting from field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he got into the first line and with the “most courage” he led the line forward before he cast himself into the field of fire and knocked out three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
The 72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I could never do but something that is humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, following the show, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, held a wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honor that he could participate in the show,” and added that “the loss of a true hero is shown by a support that many people will provide.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead got Peppa pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the corrupt Bellator 206, just to deny you the main event.
The reading from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a mutual match, the viewers in the UK remained amazing when intelligence turned into a show about Peppa's pig.
Some remained unsatisfy after they were awake until early this morning due to the game.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in broadcast for children as "a sure form of bad joke."
"In the case of a government regulation, this content is not suitable at 6 am, and it is therefore necessary to send children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president for marketing and communication of Bellator after being asked for this transfer.
"Peppa's umbrella," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that the viewers in the UK will be involved in the future.
“I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
“ But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can’t make it by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of textiles going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again next time.
We will reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried all the strength to keep our promises to our fans and we have failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
Tom Daley said that he grew up with a feeling of minority for all because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to go for success.
The 24 - year - old athlete said that until he entered high school, he did not realize that “not all are like him.”
On Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give the others "hope."
He also said that, thanks to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
A regular moderator for the long-term Kirsty Young series had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a first-year-old in Laverno's first program, said that he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him at the same time, because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: "When so far these feelings of minorness and otherwise the real things that gave me strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said not to disappoint anyone who, if necessary, would find out how it was with his sexuality.
Double holder of the Bronze Olympic Medal has become a fighter for LGBT movement rights with high profile and has used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he was lucky to live openly without consequences and wants to add to others “the hope. ”
This three-time world champion said that he was in love with a man – the American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “has been unprepared.”
Daley took the Oskar holder who was 20 years older, took the last year, but he said that age difference was never a problem.
“If you experience so much at such a young age – he was 14 years old when he was the first Olympics and his father died three years later on cancer – he said it wasn’t easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and falls.
Two people adopted Robert Ray Black-Dodley's son in June, and Daley said that "the whole point of view changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would all be like, "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son got a name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't want to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had already got tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The year Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and gained a bronze.
“I knew I had dreamt of it all my life – jumping before the eyes of our home in the Olympics, I do not know a better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first composition – Proud from Heather Small – which resonated with him during the opening of the Olympics and kept causing goose bumps in it.

Mickelson, who was out of shape on Saturday at Ryder Cup, ended up on a bench
American Phil Mickelson would record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he would have to make up a form to prevent it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played events held every two years on the record of sublime, sent Captain Jim Furuk to Saturday's footballes and foursoms on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events, as often used to be in the United States, he spent five times his day playing his day alternately between cheerleaders and working in a row that he hoped would fix what he was suffering.
This 48-year-old player has never been the directest of the drivers, even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow playground Le Golf National, where long-membered terrain routinely punishs stray missiles.
And if the golf course itself is not very worrying, it is against Mickelson in the ninth Sunday match to the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion who won all four of his games in the team with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans who had four less points had started 12 separate swords, they would have avoided the rapid launch, Mickelson's machete could have proved absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, and he didn't give anything else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, pats me on the back, gave me his hand around his shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Hall of straw and in the past this week he has been so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine he was going to play two mas.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record in most of the West Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which has never reached the height of its individual record.
Mickelson has reached 18 victories, 20 prohers and seven rémez, even though Furik says that his presence of the team has brought some unharmed results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and is a great partner in the team’s room,” he explained.
“I think younger players enjoyed the fun of coming to him this week, which was fun to observe.
He's doing a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leadership can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European Union, knows from experience that the great leadership in singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change to an uncomfortable ride.
The data debuted at the game in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the finish line got completely tightly welcomed by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You must keep remembering that we had a big lead in Valderram, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, so that Le Golf National leads 10-6.
So history and every member of this team have shown me it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be bored.
Get in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have the target, and that's why we try to get the trophy, and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, comforted by his players on a difficult golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're supposed to be there for yourself, your golf player's capacity is fully verified.
That's the message you have to hand over to the players to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furuk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great vomits when he was part of the winning team in Brooklin to end up injured when Europe reached the “Mednah Miracle”.
"I remember every damn word", he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head for the last day.
“Tomorrow, we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin, like in Medinah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts considerable pressure on the middle matches.
According to that, we've set up a lineup and made the boys feel like you know how we're supposed to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked to try an attack and stand up to Rory McIlroy in the top match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers all the way, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
German new warship still postponed
The most recent German maritime frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace ageing warships from the cold war era, but it will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowfronted coasts, reports local media.
The operation of the head of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a brand new class of Baden-Wuertemberg, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to Die Zeit's quote spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the van were upset by the fate of this ambitious project.
As replacement of the ageing fregat of the Bremen class, four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-sold ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include long maintenance time – the latest frigates should be possible for up to two years outside domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that the top marine ships, which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to overseas, will be obsolete until they are put into operation, recorded by Die Zeit's diary.
Nebly famous frigate F125 came to the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
Only few were known about the reasons for returning, but the German media quoted a number of major “software errors and faults on metal elements” that caused the warship to be useless in the fight.
Software errors have been particularly important since Baden-Wuertemberg class vessel will operate crews of some 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on the fregats of the Bremen class.
It has also been shown that the ship has a much overweight, which reduces its performance and reduces the capacity of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faults on metal elements, the problem is also the cost of the whole project – including training of the crew.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, there was a price of EUR 3.1 billion in return.
Problems with recent fregats have been of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the Marine Army was actually “a ship capable of deployment”.
This representative stated that the problems had been packed continuously because the old ships were removed from operation, but no substitutes were provided.
He commented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to become part of the Navy’s equipment.
Organisation National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is taking place at the Netopy seat of Scotland, focusing on discovering how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities for the preservation of this species.
The study by scientists of the Association National Trust for Scotland will be watching bats whistling and the smallest and least brown long and watery in the Vverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special record recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat seat, which will monitor the activity of bats throughout the entire season.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings finds the frequency of calling bats and what individual species do.
Next, a map of the habitat will be issued and a report will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource consultant for NTS, hopes that results show which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the work of the habitat, such as the formation of meadows, and the best procedure for maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and all the UK in the last century are very large.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affects colonies and natural environments.
Risks can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as traps on flies and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes for hunting their prey.
They use the sophisticated echo-location technique to track the bugs and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, colony control, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even set up the first and only reserved bat reservation in the Threave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson's headquarters manager states it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“ We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to survive."
It highlights the importance of control of bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one parent nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it's illegal to kill them, trouble them, disturb them or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to add her hand to work and help.
She said: “About our bats and many species that we do not know how their populations are doing, we must learn a lot more about.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges as “false news ” and said that people “want to see” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue for the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese guy and his attacker for Juventus were charged with rapeing American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She reportedly paid $375 000 to keep her case quiet, inform Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours from the publication of the charge, a 33 - year - old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million watcher and referred the information as “false news”.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time holder of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy, and I'm fine," said a smile player.
According to Reuters, Ronalde's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel's journal of unfounded charges, which are called ‘inadmissible reports of suspicion in private areas’.
Legalist Christian Schertz stated that a player would be required to compensate for “moral damage to the level of adequate severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights lately.”
The alleged incident was due in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the playroom, where she was reportedly raped in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell after an alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" "cladas" and "one percent" failed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensus.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an outside settlement because she “was afraid of retribution” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking a reintroduction of proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge from the attack of turkeys since the transfer to the Real Madrid club from Manchester United, bought it this summer for 100 million euros by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will forever regret” if after Brexit lost its world leader status in the production of cars, the secretary said to Greg Clark.
He added that it was “serious” that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, she would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car vehicle stated that the impact of the delay at the border in the event of an agreement on Brexit is not concluded, a job may be taken.
In Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis produced the Toyota brand, they produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice a halt in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
The BMW, for example, states that it will close its car production plant at Oxford just a month after Brexit.
Main concerns are related to what manufacturers call risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of supply of "procurement" and parts from suppliers in Great Britain and the EU are supplied to cars manufactured on order in 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to a delay and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus there would be a halt in production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans to reinstate future relations with the EU are "exactly calibrated to avoid these controls at the borders."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow me to say not only the current success, but also the understanding of this opportunity," said Radio 4's Today in the BBC program.
"The proof not only from Toyota but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union in the race, said that they are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places have disappeared, they will never return.
The spokesperson declared: “We have established a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be late again, reports the White House
Donald Trumpa's high-level meeting with Deputy General Rod Rosenstein could be "an additional week away" because he continued to fight for the highest judge's post with Brett Kavanaugh, he communicated the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of the work of a special council of Robert Mueller, which examines the intervention of the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's branches and Russia, and the possible judicial obstruction by the President.
To let Trump release the acting superintendent and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's cages have been at stake for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times daily stated that Rosenstein discussed wearing cameras to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of taking down the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he came to the White House, surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein would not let go of the Council, but then the meeting was delayed for her not to be involved in a hearing at the Senate Board, where Kavanaugh's witnesses and one of the women who charged him with sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday's news on Fox Channel.
She replied on a question of a meeting with Rosenstein: “It is not yet a date, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on at the highest trial.
But we will see and I will always communicate current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not arranged a press conference with the White House since 10th September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that too few press conferences were not due to an aversion to the “divadre” of television reporters, although she said: “I do not agree with the fact that they would get off.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press will grow.
"The President holds more questions and answers than any president before him," he added without making any evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying and seeing that we've been doing this over the last few weeks and that the press conference will take place where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with visitors to the High Representative.
Private press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President probably showed why with his loose and sometimes bizarre attention to the gathered reporters.
The Minister of Health writes EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to employees from the EU who work in Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and their wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter, not six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of applying for settlement requests for EU citizens who work in transferable public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “For the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU are continuing to depart and are heading towards the expected decision this year in autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without an agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassuring you how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and outside it have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial for patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our great wishes are for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie progresses an emergency surgery after a head injury
The extortion Abercrombie moved an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a Saturday defeat of 31-27 from the opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics put Abercrombie on the side line of oxygen and then put it on the stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
The shareholder in Tennessee told Chrisz Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had advanced a surgical procedure at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that so far no “no details of the type/extent of the injury” are available and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in red T-shirt, graduated from the first season for the State of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 procedure in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on real estate purchase in the UK
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher real estate tax when he buys in the UK, with money being used to help the homeless in the new Tory's plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move, which aims to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation for higher property taxes will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
An increase of £ 120 million per year is expected to be made to help people without home.
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they purchase real estate in Great Britain, with money being used to help people without home, will notify Theresa May today.
This act will be recorded as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success towards attracting young voters with a promise to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high income.
The increase in property purchase tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with money strengthening government efforts to fight with sleeping without a roof over their heads.
An additional charge which is an additional to the current obligation to pay real estate purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second houses and the purchase for rent purposes, may reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the Treasury will increase its funds by up to CZK 120 million per year.
The estimates say that the newly built properties in London are buying 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which drives prices and makes it difficult for those who buy first time, to get on a ladder home.
Many of the rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “city of spirits” because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
New principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchases tax to help more young people to own the first house.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking land, but not using it, and he insisted on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable houses to repair the "inadvertent home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a bonded range of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the termination of the "no" eviction.
He also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Ms Mayová said: “I said last year that I wanted to make my efforts as prime minister for the restoration of the British dream – so that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and form life.
However, it cannot be right that it is easy for individuals who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as the hard-working residents of Great Britain.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the sweat of sleeping without a roof over your head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that he is his “most ambition” to become Scottish manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds its third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he went to the Stadium of Light after he led St Mirren back the League Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B rank, and it was," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that is always something that will drag me back.
Such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in leading the club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Cano.
Former Chief of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety from the follow-up of such established names in such a big club when he rejected the foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town before.
"The success would at that time be the question of if I could return this club to Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put it back there, but I'd probably feel successful if I could return the club."
Ross's been doing his career in the lead for only three years, before he acted as a Assistant Chief in Dumarton, and he spent 15 months as between coaches of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the retreat to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning fall on the winner of the title of champions in the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," remembers the time that Alloa took place.
“ I truly believed that the leadership was the right thing to do, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, made good money and enjoyed the right heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through a week.
I keep going through them from the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling in the management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my entire adult life."

Research found out that a great time for the pint was Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The numbers show that pub and bar groups recorded an increase of 2,7 percent in sales in July – but restaurant income decreased by 4,8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who produced the final report, stated: “A stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the pub increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The fall in the restaurant’s sales by 1.8 percent in June has worsened.
The pubs and the drinks-painting bars have so far been as much as the restaurants have worsened.
The pubs whose main sales are made of food have also suffered the sun, even though not as dramatic as the restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the controlled values and the bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6% per month, while the sale of food fell by three percent."
“ These results are the continuation of a trend that lasts from the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chain continues to fight, although annual sales decline by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing pressures on costs.
Long summer can't be any worse time for food and time operators to say whether the milder temperatures we've experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Ciffer Peach Tracker Industry Monitor for the British pub, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector..
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents
Every fifth child – at only 11 years of age – has a secret account in social networks, which hides from parents and teachers, shows research
Research among 20,000 secondary school students showed the rise of “false instagram pages”
Reports raised concerns that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account of which parents know of
Every fifth child – at only 11 years of age – creates accounts in social networks that hide from their parents.
The survey between 20,000 secondary school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports show concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students reported that they had an embossed “main” account that parents know about and at the same time have a private account.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret web site found that her teenager urged others to “be raped.”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistpresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles and half admits they keep private accounts.
Chief HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that he has so many teenagers temptations to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inviolable director for the annual general meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most valued light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the shift as a great opportunity for those who are in the direction of sport as those for whom its far-reaching experience at international level in the past decade will be useful.
“Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athlete community and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athlete in Scotland if he is a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be truly beneficial, and I can help you conduct sports in Scotland.”
An American who won 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996 won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular expert in the BBC, could not walk after the transistorischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was time to see if I'd recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've proven full healing, learned to walk again, and today I'm in control of the drill!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk delivery that causes comparison of mothers to tie shares online
The company dealing with the production of the reindeer divided the online thought by advertising, which compared the nursing mother to the cow.
In the context of placing on the market the “first silent transportable vacuum cleaners in the world” the consumer company of Envi released a music video with a superstructure on which freedom is shown by the new vacuum cleaner to be giving to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows for a song with a text: "Yes, I do, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed that I don't have a venereal, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: “Pumper, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I will drink my sweet milk. ”
A commercial that was published on the corporate facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and got mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them indicated that it sheds light on the "horry" dairy industry.
‘A great poor decision to exploit the cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to give milk, but the children are taken away a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie vacuum cleaners are discreetly placed on the breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Other comment: “Intelligiblely traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them for advertising on a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: “This ad is completely off. ”
They also appeared who defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she considered the song “infective”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I were still breast-feeding.
I feel like a cow when I'm sucking up.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's important.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who suck milk (sometimes at work or toilets) and feel like “creats”.
It's not an ad to praise or lose the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck milk are saying they feel like cows.
But Elvie's vacuum cleaner is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and beautifully hides in breast-feeding bras, so women give freedom to move, the possibility of holding a child and even when sucking to walk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers added a comment: “The Elvie crew is a revolutionary product that deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating parallels between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out milking and all challenges associated with it and show a fun and reliable sense of freedom that provides a new vacuum cleaner.
It's not the first time that Elvie's reseller got on the high street.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers of the designer Martha Jakubowski, who just used the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrants moved quietly to a specific camp at the Texas border
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have been stifled by the placement of children.
Most of the accompanying were traditionally made up of immigrants without documents, who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed that they belonged to the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the immigration and customs department, testified that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who asked for the status of escorted minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arresters had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," said Albence.
According to asylum workers, leaders have put in place new rules which will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
A lot appears through a call within the videoconference instead of personally stating their case as legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to help according to the report will be quickly deported.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely an anxiety or depression occurs in him, which may result in an explosion of rage or attempts to escape, says asylum workers and report from the system in the last few months.
The lawyers show that these fears are increased in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering, are more likely not to be noticed due to the size of the device.
They added that transferring children to the camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or separation with friends could cause trauma, with which many children are already fighting.
Syria has announced that they are to be downloaded immediately by the American, French and Turkish "occupational Folders"
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moual, also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of war in the country has already been held.
Moral, also representing the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegal, under the predominance of the fight against terrorism, and that “that will be imposed accordingly.”
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Mousually insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria has been almost over,” with more than 360 000 people perished since 2011 and millions more have lost their homes.
He said that Damašek would continue to “to fight in this holy battle until we removed all the Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, which mainly train the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting with the President President Bashar al-Assad and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of the war.
During the release of refugees, Moual declared that there were good conditions for them to return and accused them of “some Western countries” from “drilling unraveling fears” that caused refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They regret what should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that no recovery aid would be available for Syria until there was a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats show that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protective zone in the last Idlib attack has created an opportunity to move on in political discussions.
The Russian-Nature Agreement has prevented the great attack of Syrian forces captured by Russia on provinces where three million people live.
However, Moual pointed out that the agreement had ‘the deadline clearly given’ and expressed the hope that the military procedure would be aimed at jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, with the link to Al-Qaedu, who would be “dicated”.
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose the post-war constitution for Syria and the distribution of the path to elections will take place soon.
Most of them set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, in the words that the work of the panel should be limited to the "control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before action is taken.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020, if, as expected, many liberal observers, prosecutions and scandals had not stopped his office early in office as president.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most expensive finale of the presidential period in history”.
Until now, there are no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the ratings in the main transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million to CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.

“It’s a heat that people attract, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Survey” program on the ABC drama about the secretary of the cabin that became president after the attack destroyed the Capital.

He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before his election in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote Trumpa.
Why? She asked.
“ He said: “Because he is funny, ” she told me Mrs. Scovell.
It's a matter of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else in TV, the story of Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reconnect and to the benefit of the global economy.

The money runs outside into the most beautiful home races medium-term choices
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania after experiencing the influx of finance, thanks to the reorganisation of congress districts that generated two holders of office in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the redesign of the Pittsburg district district district district of the District Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb – which has won a different district in the special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another office holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is highly overlapping with the new 17.
After the highest pension court issued an opinion in January that the old districts were infinitely divided for the benefit of the Republicans, there was a remodeling of the map.
The race in the new 17th district began with a sharp financial debate between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in the monitored March special elections to the 18th convention district.
This chair was occupied by the Republican and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Politicians give the Democrats a slight lead.
America considers the penalty to Salvador for China’s support, then retreats
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in the hotel in Panama until the partners have removed the Trump management team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “no later decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said the spokesman of the Ministry of Health Nauert in the statement issued by the beginning of the month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of American aid in 2017, including means of controlling drug, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included the reduction of financial assistance and focused on visa restriction, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With the ongoing internal negotiations, the North American and Central American leaders put forward a high level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which is related to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was recorded as a step forward in seeking to prevent migrants heading to the US.
By mid-September, however, the leading administrative officials explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively end any fine that was considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of a conference currently scheduled for half October, within the signal which the administration places on the agenda, diplomats have put in place.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unbroken reports from Washington.
The White House spokesperson Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American leaders, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources were confirmed by an external analyst, which is close to government eclective and also spoke under anonymity condition.
Study History
The definitive nail to the coffin could be Robert Mueller's special commission report on the possible prevention of Mr Trump in law enforcement, which is now evidence of a lot of evidence in public records.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is allegedly turning to see if Mr Trump's campaign had a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our election.
If the Congress had an exchange of parties, Mr Trump would have had to commit his responsibility before this authority, just as he was preparing to re-enter before the voters, and ultimately a jury composed of his colleagues would have expected him.
This is a series of "if", and I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trumpa is inevitable – just as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to throw a knock against Hitler, only to build and support Western Powers in Munich's Czechoslovakia.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid long runts full of bloodshed that followed.
History spins around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the integrity of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump throws out Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, this is the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein's had it done since the report announced that last year he designed to secretly record the president and speculate that he was not in a health condition to stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times are inexcusable.
“How do we react if Bretta Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite a persuasive accusation of sexual assault and persuasion?
And most importantly, we're going to vote in the middle of our term of office for Congress, which believes is Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on the table with the swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about encountering Rapid Vienna
Rangers, on Thursday, guests of Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory over the Rakušany would have given them an impressive empire in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month, giving them great hope of a procedure from the G Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing on the field for the first time in the season until the draw of 2-2 with Villarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal has a quality team," declared 31-year-old player.
“ We went to a fight with faith that we could take something off, and we took a point.
We may have been able to reproduce it at the end, but in general, there was a tie that was probably just.
They were probably better at the first half, but in the second half we got better, and we were better again.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because they've played a good result in the last match, but I'm sure with the audience behind the back that we can push and it's gonna go well.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but I feel really good about it right now.
The team's strong and the guys are really enjoying it, and training's cool, too.
"I hope we'll lean on it now, we'll put the season behind us last season and we'll be successful."
Women worry about pension savings
Even though participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study said that she and her partner were discussing the price of long-term care.
Just 10 percent said she talked to her kids about it.
“The people want a family member to take care of them, but they do not decide to discuss it with him,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare a family to provide care if you do not reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your consultant and family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a great role in determining the price.
Take your financial advisor: The adviser can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay these expenses or by using your own funds as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Determine the medical care representative, which will be a credible person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that the doctors respect your wishes unless you can communicate.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a trustable person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not eligible for this.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Write these details into the written plan to make you ready.
“In the game, they are not just finance, but, for example, what are their names, doctors?” Martin asks.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the mentioned plan ready for hand."

Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfulll Saipova, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – this is an exceptional punishment which has not been granted for a federal crime in the State since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly in October, did an attack on a bike along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by means of a rental truck Home Depot that broke down the walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intrusively" killed eight victims and "intrusively" caused a number of injuries – that is how the conditions of intent to grant death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to judicial documents, both numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipova of 22 crime crimes, among which, for example, the charges of murder in favour of extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges against violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and preparation,” claims the applicants and describes the way they did Saip's act, as a terrible, cruel and perverted one.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendzos and Alejandra Damian Pagucca,” is mentioned in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York Court has last given a death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to lifelong freedom.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in relation to a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, which was demonstrated a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs settled on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated according to judicial documents during the days and months following the attack a minimum regret.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipo's accusations, he told the authorities that he was inspired by monitoring the Islamic state's video on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also published that they also demanded the suspension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that they were “inclusively disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decisions.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend trauma from these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
A team of Saipo's defenders had already asked the plaintiff not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Members, the Parties should be responsible for the negotiations on Mr NIGEL FAAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage committed to mobilise the army of the people’s army.”
The former United Kingdom independent Party declared that politicians must feel pressure by Euroskeptics – as suggested by one of Theresa May's own Members, should negotiate with the EU.
Many conservative MEP Peter Bone declared on his march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would now be out there" if he was the secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep circle, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for a stay in the EU who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers under the attack of the supporters of Brexit, supporters to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
The speakers insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourians to choose between its package and chaos.”
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to leave for Chequers.’
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should be a deputy and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he were in charge, we would already be out today,” he said.
Member of the Wellingborough added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must bail out on Chequers."
To demonstrate our opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought the world war to listen.
In our own country, we want to do our own laws.”
Mr Bone has rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British citizens would change their mind and want to stay is completely fair.”
The Conservative supporter of Brexitu Andrea Jenkyns, who also participated in the march, told the reporters: "One thing I say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Chequers is unliked with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they do not like him members of our party nor our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In Mrs May's sharp report, he says, "Minister Presidents keep their seat when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians had to get into an awkward situation if they wanted to betray their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
,Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They try to betray Brexit and we are standing here today to tell them that we will not allow you.”
In the report of an excited crowd, he added: "I want our political class to feel pressure on the edge of Brexit's injury.
"We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has guaranteed our victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain, who is capable of itself."
In the meantime, the supporters of the Union marched with Birmingham and then arranged a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had banners of Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend start of the operation of this party.
Mr. Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of problems with the security of the party's application after the opening of the conference.

He's a farce.
There is nothing like good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to think carefully about the run for president
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after November’s elections, she would “think the candidacy of the president properly. ”
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat has talked about its future on Saturday at the City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the early critic of President Donald Trumpa, is attempting a November re-elect against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the centre of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at the city hall since Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her whether she was planning to be the president's office.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place."

A video from Friday's shooting has been issued for identification of a man caught on a recording.

“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that was not associated with life,” said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul media on Saturday through the web 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was moving at the crime scene, had a gun, and he even confessed to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was taken without incident and taken into custody in East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great Russian Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the world master title when the team's regime joined his hands to victory over Sebastian Vettel.
The moment Valtteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team was going to play a big role in the race.
From the position field, Bottas had a good start and nearly got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and called Vettel to attack a team partner.
Vettel entered the depa as the first to let Hamilton catch up with a car running around the group's hair, which should be decisive.
The rider of the Mercedes went to the depot for a round later, and after leaving he went to the Vettelo. However, Hamilton went forward and in a tight fight had to leave the Ferrari rider eagerly to leave the inner track free so he could defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen pulled out of the rear row of the wheel and at the end of the first round he was on the 21st birthday in the lead.
He then led the big part of the race because he kept the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could lock Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot in the 44rd round, but in the remaining eight wheels he couldn't increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's meeting because she insisted she didn't post a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with a charge of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault.
During his speech at the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate court, instead of saying that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and distrustful and lying."
“One thing that could happen, and a beautiful thing that’s going on in Sennar these last days, when you see that anger when you see those people angry and angry and disgusting and lying,” he said.
"If you look at the issue and the publication, and they will tell you: "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get behind this leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped in early September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statement, I didn't even publish the case information," said Mr. Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words seem to have been rejected by the President, who referred to the meeting on Saturday night, saying: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women charged with sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the anger, the abomination, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they need to put in the country to get back to power and to the steering wheel," Mediaite quoted the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants the prize at the Saturday retreat in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants were soon taken over by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for their house balance before Dwyer returned the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard then compared again for Dundee, making two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the Adam Keefe team, who succeeded in defeating 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met in the season four times, with all three previous matches controlled by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in four minutes, in time 3:35, at Kendalla McFaulla's assist, while David Rutherford added an assist to Beauville's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cnihoe, which compared in time 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabin at the first break only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the night at the end of the first third.
The house was regrouped, and the Bouchards managed to score again from the power game at the time of 27:37.
Cninini and Charles Corcoran’s joint work later helped Nielsen for the first time in the match to move to Dundee’s side and the same player assured the management of his team in the middle of the final third.
The Giants who have now lost the fourth of the last five games will play the next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air Force Manager died to allow hundreds of people aboard the plane to escape earthquakes
The head of the air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died watching a plane with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a large earthquake that caused the tsunami on Friday.
Strong subsequent shocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even though fellow 21-year-old Anthonius Gunavan Agung was fleeing to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly rejecting control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to take care of the fact that the air Flight 6321 flight, which was at the early age, can take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought it was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've arranged a helicopter transport from Balipapan to Kalimantan, to which he was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed their concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The Agency responsible for solving the disaster said that access to Donggala, Simi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unexplained under the wreck, and many of them have not yet received rescue,” said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the devasted Pala reached a height of up to six metres, and in the city there will be mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft shall bring assistance and supplies to the affected sites.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said Sky News station: “Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small stores are all over the place."
John Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to that station CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survive, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
The Indian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military files of the country: “I ask you to work day and night and finish all the tasks that are needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN station.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The flight company operating the flight crashed in a lagoon on one of the microns in the Pacific, now stated that one person was missing, and at the beginning it indicated that all passengers and crews with a total of 47 were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in the press release stated that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find one traveling man.
Air society said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a missing man.
The airline did not react immediately to the requirements for the provision of details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane fell into the water when they tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in custody on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Air society and Navy have reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing track.
Some of the Witnesses thought the track was over.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very small height.
"That was so good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that together with the others, he managed to get water after a belt deep to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also said that the onboard staff were panicking and screaming and that he himself suffered a lighter head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that the sailors who worked nearby for port pier modifications helped rescue by means of an inflatable boat that had transported passengers to shore before the plane sank to the depths of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network states that over the last two decades, aircraft crashs with an PNG registration mark of 111 people have died, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution put an end to its speech in this case in which the man is repeatedly tried to burn a woman alive in the State of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department, in the person of its analyst, Paul Rowlett's analyst, has testified several hours and provided expert reports in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst how he used cell phone records 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was in Chambers' death on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statement, said The Clarion Ledger.
When data from a cell phone showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford was court-martialed and testified he wasn't in town the day in question.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "He's lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
However, mobile phone records indicate that these two only knew each other a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it entirely from his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the jury later that day.

Artists like The Fugees and Common have already met in recent years with recovery thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black girl?
The New Yorker sues a few for his throw out after the “racist” text message
A teenager from New York susses a few for her discrimination leave after she received a misrepresented text message from her mother, in which she was marked as the "other black" text message.
The couple refused to be racist and matched by a "determination" action.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she found out that she was a black woman, a new teacher of her children, Giselle Maurice.
She wrote in her text message by Plasco-Flaxman.
However, instead of sending her husband away, she sent her pi. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Maurice and said that she was just leaving the teacher who was African-American, she worked really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, said New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice sues a few for the compensation for leaving work and asks for a compensation of 350 USD per day of six-month engagement, for which she was initially hired, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not the case," wrote Post this Friday and added: "I know this is discrimination."
However, the two returned the strike that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco, Post.
“But would you trust your child in the hands of someone to whom you acted grossly, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco resembled an action against "determination" and said that his wife had only taken care of a two-month-old child and was in "a very difficult situation".
“Are you guys going after someone like this?
This is not a nice thing," said the investment banker.
Although the court still persists, the jury, on the social media, has quickly condemned the two for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of stories about Pynthon's bear were afraid that readers would not get hurt with a talking bear, show the latest news.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, told the rapporteur: “It’s difficult to feel in the situation of someone who read it for the first time, before publication.
It's very funny to know now that we already know the tremendous success of Pynthon's bear."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book on a small stuffed teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that became "soldhound" a dot after his death last year.
As he described as “a very important member of her family, ” he added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, he was never boastful,” she said.
“But since Pitton was such a real character for him, it was as if you had a child who achieved something that you could really be proud of.
I believe that the success of Pitton looked at this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to assign all the successes to Pynthon."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"He called regularly to tell me that this is really bad, and he does not expect him to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I had a call from Nad, where she told me she would die in another two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medication that the doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly lost their effectiveness and abandoned her body.
She died shortly afterwards, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who has already suffered the loss of her daughter, has entered the plane together with other passengers without showing how hard she is going through the tests.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“ I kept my head down, so I had tears all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt a stunning understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he could have loved her."
Missing women send postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was only 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and, as a result, he took his life in 18 years.
"I would not want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a truly dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was at that time 11, found the immeasurable body of his sibling after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am always afraid of what it will affect his life. ”
Mrs. Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they were their friends.
Don't sit quiet - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies's flighty girlfriend, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“Nothing told me that he felt at the bottom or depressed,” he explains.
“ A few days before Christmas, we watched a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Day – when children opened gifts, nor looked at them, nothing."
She stated that the death of her partner was a huge trauma to them, but that it had to gradually get through it: “This thing can make a complete hole in the family.
We've been torn apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that we could get something that actually asked – to be investigated in the time of limitation, with limited scope – we could bring some unity into this,” said Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Committee would “rave off” because both sides of the party would be buried in acquired positions.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well on schedule.
The elections in the middle of the term of office are only five weeks far away from us, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected badly, this will lead to their fundamental weakness in attempts to enforce the requested man at post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush was calling the senators, lobbying with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and through him, he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary back then.
What happens if the FBI builds up his report?
The Senate will vote on this, and currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which enabled Vice President Mike Pence to break down the draw and confirm at the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim are "lowed"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of government, Kim Chong-Un, seven years ago, claims the South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korean Union for Unification, stated that during the last year 1127 escapes – compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that this includes more stringent checks at the borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates of smugglers required at the borders.
Pyongyang didn't release any public statements.
The large majority of North refugees today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30 000 North Koreans crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has longest borders and it is easier to cross it than in a heavily protected demitarianized band (DMZ) between both Korea and Korea.
China calls refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often forced them to repatriate.
The relationship between the North and the South – technically still in the war – has improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongjang to talks which focused on suspended deuclaration negotiations.
This happened in the historic meeting of President Donald Trumpa and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on the extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States that there is no progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we will be unilaterally disarmed," Mr Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that thanks to her temperament, it is inappropriate for the service of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman ever performed such a theatre, they would call her “hysterical”, Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh’s fourth statement before the Senate court.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still teenage.
During his initial words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screamed and suffocated when dealing with his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their charges against him were "grossic and coordinated attacks" by organised liberals who could not carry over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was presupposed against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received a majority in the House.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not eligible not only for the work of the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working on now,” says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential returns of Kavanaugh in the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because she is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the course of the hearings prior to his confirmation in his function, Kavanaugh avoided responding to the question of whether he would relinquish certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for an adversity person to join the court and expect her to say, "Oh, that's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After the verbal outbursts, months and years of obscenities, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," she told me Mrs Steine 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
He continues: “A woman who worked the principal somewhere and said to me that she was crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique. It means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued to do it.
And I think that's great."
The words are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most alive memories comes from my first job where I worked in an office where men dominated, and once I expressed my unexplained anger crying. But the older, always a cold manager, who was always a little afraid, caught me behind my neck and dragged me into the stairwell.
"Don't ever show them you're crying," she told me.
“ They don’t know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorado, cooperated with Gary Hart at his presidential firm.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an unmarried affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidate.
"It was not a very well thought-out decision," she told me laughter after 30 years.
“ Seven other candidates and the last thing they needed were another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and seven dwarfs.
Because at that time, the campaign was running long ago, she couldn't keep up with getting her contributions and so she committed not to go to the game unless she gets $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, a frustration with a system that made her harder to raise money and focus on the voters rather than on delegates and anger over sexism that she was completely suffocated with anger.
“You might think I’ve been nervously upset,” said Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
“And perhaps you would think my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write to me on a tombstone.
"Girled"?
Why Can Be China-American Trade War for Beijing Good
The opening balance of the trade war between the US and China was stunning and even though the battle is not far from being fought, according to experts between being a crackdown between countries in the long term, it is beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, U.S. president, provided the first warning this year by making Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, have seen the light of the world this week when new tariffs for goods were declared for USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which is virtually taxing half of Chinese exports to the USA.
Beijing has always reacted by introducing the most recent tariffs to five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China has tried to pay the same coin to the US, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would knock on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to the original tracks, it would be a violation of his demands, but public submission to American demands would be absolutely humiliating for Chinese president Si Jin-Pching.
Even though experts think that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in a long-term way because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that the quick political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic hive in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have admitted so far," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the re-construction of the country over the seven-yearth war.
When speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister Walid al-Moual stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in the territory today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed terrorists into normal conditions.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in building a degraded country.
However, he stressed that he would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that were sponsoring the rebels.
Europe quickly responded to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with final score 16,5 to 10,5 on Le Golf National field on the edge of difficulty in France.
The US has now lost the sixth in Europe, so Ryder Cup has not won Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the U.S. Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then set the ball off into the water for 3 pairs of 16. hole and left Francesco Molinari's victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari then stared in all his bikes and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score of 5-0-0 since the existing tournament format in 1979 was approved.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most rated player, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who probably graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European player with 25,5 points won for his career.
“ I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy I got my cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad I could help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Rampo, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said Rahm 23.
Woods has lost all four games in France and has now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time who won the 14 greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team fought the whole weekend in trying to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated the top golf during the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, following the unrest results of his team, said: “I am proud of those boys, really fought.
We actually warmed Europe with our heart this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm putting my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee will move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to get stuck.
You played us."
Red flow update: The concentration is reduced in the Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in the Tampa Bay red tide concentration.
According to FWC's message, water flowering spots are now reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – this suggests a shrinking concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles [ 130 km] from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The closets were observed about 10 miles from the coast in the Hillsborough district, but last week it was relatively less places.
The red inflow was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed on the high seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations off the coast or the high seas at the Sarasota district, the lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte, the lowest to high concentrations at the coast or the high seas at the Lee district and the low concentrations in the Collier district.
The respiratory irritation continues to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Airway irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida last week.
