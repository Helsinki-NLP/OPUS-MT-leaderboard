Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in white satin
He's a charismatic.
He has the Holy Mass of Salvation and healing delivered the crowds.
He was several years old when things began in his life unexplainable.
Today, through Franciscanine, others experience it.
To be repaired by o. Witko Masse u. o. release and healing attract crowds
He used to be the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole in his heart size of 7.5 mm.
It was supposed to be operating.
Joseph Witko's father prayed over him.
The boy was taken to the hospital that same day for surgery.
The doctors said: "Operation is not needed, the drop is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, Franciscan's hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual work of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In their dreams, pure souls came to him asking for help.
I was woken up at night and wanted to pray for the dead and those who died at a given time – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body has begun to change.
I lost human characteristics and started to adopt the look of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he couldn't raise his voice.
He felt like he was lost.
That's when God showed him a rescue.
"In the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the saint, I was released and returned to the human form...", he says.
He didn't tell anyone about the strangest experience.
He grew up with a calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his preaching, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count to get rid of the disease are involved in the Masses of healing performed by Father Witko.
However, the clergy underlines that their primary goal is to heal spiritualally and not physical.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September) On the afternoon of Kolpinga FRAC, she deserved to be the current master of Poland Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the framework of the 3rd line of the ROTTO Superligi Table Tennis.
Jarosławians in such a personal set as they presented with the grenchants have no chance of winning the league sovereigns.
He showed this a great deal to Dartom Bogoria.
There's still a missing team called the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps there would be a triumph in the new season after the third of the triumphs.
The young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown to win with dozens such as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most predictable Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest competition star in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
In the run from Qiyao Hanen as well as Kou Lei, he was a class himself.
After three dues Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Lei has probably won Mark Badowski and Daniel Górek after an emotional five hundredth struggle – Pavel Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.
There won't be any more studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzawowski’s predictions, a free prophylactic research programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it did not gain the acceptance of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
The Agency explained in its justification that the target group was wrongly selected.
"In fact, higher measures may result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with falsely positive research," he wrote.
The resort's decisions don't understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine, then they will go to a doctor, which is absurd because it's just about to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here that I do not understand," says Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can hardly imagine the experts running saying, "Let's not study because there will be longer queues with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that there is a health service in this state," said POs.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break down all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break down any agreement with Israel if the future government of this country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanjahu's statement on the Palestinian land being occupied.
“If the future government of Israel, as it will arise, will come to this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and we will withdraw from all commitments taken,” he announced.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with the pressure of Abas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – which will be of little importance – by engaging completely in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism", said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyah, the current Prime Minister of Israel, again received the government's mission after the elections of September 17th.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank to Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States identified.
At the session of the UN General Assembly, 84-year-old Abas also promised to take place on the ground of Palestinian universal elections.
The last one took place in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I call on the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem the Eastern elections and all who would oppose them will have to respond for their actions before God and the international community", declared the Palestinian president.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, for the exercise of the powers conferred on UN members and all its bodies and institutions.
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "sustain Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations."
Israel’s ambassador Danny Danon briefly replied to the statement of Abbas, saying that the Palestinian leader “will let the UN focus on efforts by the Palestinian Authority against Israel than against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership”.
But Danon, as the agencies record, did not refer to Netanyah’s announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.

Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, the activater's wife, called on September 23th as Secretary of the Communist Party from her home village to announce that his husband just died in the military hospital in Hengyang.
What caused death - he did not reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, his ears, his nose and mouth were all in the blood," says a woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell with them, and there were a lot of police officers around, who didn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband had been ill and died of a "unhappi accident".
105 million PLN for video games companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost 105 million PLN of funding will be made available to gambling companies, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the III edition of GameINN.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was, among others, the development of a platform to create field-based games based on the AR engine, creating a real world map, together with an application that enables users to send data from users; a testing and training platform to verify practical skills at work and professional excellence using VR and AI; an innovative game that simplifies real manufacturing processes using innovative game-based virtual world-to-world interactions with the real world using industry 4.0 – the NBBR communication sent on Friday PAP.
The aim of the GameINN Sector Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video games sector in the global market in the period up to 2023.
As the NCBR says, the Polish video games sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video games market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
"The closely prepared GameINN Research Agenda and the already 300 million PLN of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", we read in the Communication.
Video games industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for business innovation, such as R & D reliefs, skills improvement programmes, IP boxing, and NCBR support programmes, drive companies’ innovative activities and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market”, says Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin, Minister of Science and Higher Education, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that not only do the innovation money come to innovations in the form of project funding, but also in their pockets – with a relief for R & D in 2018, three quarters more than one year before.
“The amount of R & D costs deducted was PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million savings to companies benefiting from this relief.
This is equivalent to the support provided by the NCBR in three GameINN editions", stresses Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kameniecki recalls that in the two previous grant contests, more than PLN 211.2 million were awarded to 78 innovative projects.
A huge interest in the III competition and the variety of proposals show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"In particular, the fact that among the projects selected – as in previous editions – there are projects for entertainment not only, but also related to Industry 4.0", adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million PLN could apply for entrepreneurs, business consortia and business consortia with scientific units.
87 requests for total funding amount of approximately PLN 317 million were received by the NCBR.
The budget of the competition was PLN 100 million at the time of the announcement of the competition, but was increased so that 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN's III are available on the page ncbr.gov.pl.
GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among other things, companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloomber Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
It happened September 16th.
Dolberg, who came from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not as much as 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish didn't show up for class the next day, explaining the stomach problems.
The case from the beginning was a mystery.
Private safes are available in the locker room, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the Diaby-Fadig.
18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the band and coach Patrick Viera.
He also promised Dani to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most forward-looking young generation players in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to debut three years later in the first team.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper “L’Equipe” gave, the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
So far, he's started a disciplinary action against his opponent.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And yet most of us wash them apart!
It is enough warm water and normal soap – it is not true that there must be antibacterial (many doctors turn them away).
While washing, we wipe not only the underpants and the tops of your hand, but also: finger ends (with or single) – rub them with collapsing movements of the inner hand, spaces between your fingers (reflect hands, wiping your fingers against you), thumbs – each thumb we cover with the other hand and in such a round, turn them into the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash hands) we should wipe out our hands with wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in roads, from 5 zł).
When using the public toilet, do not touch the washed handle(s) of the door or the door (recommendment of the Chief Sanitary Inspector).
Open it through the paper towel.
President Iran says he rejected the US discussion proposal, Donald Trump denied it.
Tehran did not make talks with the American party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to withdraw the sanctions, said on Friday, President of Iran Hasan Rowhani.
The president of the U.S. Donald Trump commented that it was an Iranian party who asked for the restriction to be lifted, which he did not agree to.
According to President Iran Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed that all sanctions imposed on Tehran be abolished in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and its ballistic missile construction programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these talks on account of the "toxic atmosphere".
He declared that he had met the American diplomats because it had been pointed out by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not hold talks in the atmosphere of "Maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be," Rowhani said.
The day prior to Iran’s leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement rejected the promotion of US sanctions in Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran following the occurrence of the U.S. nuclear agreement “are a prerequisite that does not allow” to establish a dialogue.
If we can lift this condition in advance, and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to this conversation during the week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian party.
“Iran wanted me to bear the sanctions imposed upon them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no!»" said the President of the United States.
Pressure with atomic background agreement
France, Germany and the UK are trying to mitigate the tension between Washington and Tehran in some form to save an agreement with Iran in 2015, which they were signatories.
In exchange for the abolition of the economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapon building programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to control by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories confirmed on several occasions that they wanted to maintain an agreement.
It didn't work out yet.
Washington uses a tactic of maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if he did not receive a raw material export permit, he would limit his obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

Judge of the Military Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the head of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalker's trial, was brought back to the NSA's ruling on Wednesday.
Reason: there is no disciplinary action against him, so there is no basis to maintain the order of WSA Chairman Wojciech Mazur to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromitski, the disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, launched an investigation into Szydt at the end of August, but it has not yet changed into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take into account the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its publication.
In this situation, a judge, who publicly spoke of the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, which, due to suspicions of participation in the Heterite group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szydt is denying his share in the state-of-the-art group.
He claims that there is no evidence other than the falsified screens and the words of his wife, whom he divorces.
The same is true for the other judges of the connection with "Casta": everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll be on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't give her a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it also speaks of the content of Emilia Szydt's phone, which kept the phone in June in another case.
The police did not force a finger to secure the devices of those who, as persecutors, pointed out in a report from February of Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence – no Szydt case, no matter "Kasty".
There is also no case of chief Marian Banasi to rent a building for basements and to hide his income.
The CBA shall check its property statements.
And she'll check when she checks.
The Committee on the Ethical Ethics will not take care of Banasim, because the Sejm is suspended (but the National Control Commission has somehow gathered to make a special decision to appeal to the alternates of Banasia and the appointment as a p.o. his lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide for).
The whole thing reminds me of a new American movie, I guess, when my wife comes home and stays her husband with her mistress in bed.
She's so astounded and so devastated she can't make a word.
She's standing in the door, and at that time, the lover's getting out of bed, getting dressed and getting out.
And the husband was making a bed.
When your wife gets her voice back and yells, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband asks me, "What woman, honey?
It's just, in the "Casty" case or Banasia, there's a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the jump finals
Earlier this season, when it comes to rivalry after the mother break, the brown medallist of the world from London 2017, in her first attempt beat 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1,92.
1,94 only managed to get it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first test was completely failed.
In the finals I will have to jump technically better," she admitted to Eurosport Lićwinko's camera.
American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik were the best in the eliminations after 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who had no height.
The jump finale of women is scheduled for Monday.

Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a severe state
He's hit the hospital, and his doctors are calling him heavy.
You have to add he's conscious and conscious.
“We believe it will come out again.
We all pray that she may return to health," said the anonymous person of Cornel Morawiecki in an interview with the reporters "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"In life, the closest family and politics hold me," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview that he gave to the reporters "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" indicated that the 78-year-old Cornnel Morawiecki was on a study at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
It came out that I had a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer C.T. was conducted, I found that I had a pancreas tumor...", he passed the Prime Minister's father.
A few days later, at the MSWIA Hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki had undergone a major operation.
As Morawiecki told, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many have prayed for me for what I thank you so much.
Fortunately, I don't think I have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I'm handing myself to doctors who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this hard operation, I have to go back to some state of usefulness.
I hope everything is going to be okay," said Kornel Morawiecki in January in his speech with the EC.
"If I had been too late to investigate, this situation would have been tragic and I would have already gone down with it...", he added.

Anyone who has any information about the missing is asked for contact.
The missing on September 26th, in the evening, went out of her residence, and until now she has not returned, nor has she made contact with her loved ones.
The last time was seen at the Old Church street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blonde hair and gray blue eyes.
Last time she was seen, she was wearing blue, gray pants and shoes.

The power of Olavian jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15th September at the hipdrome on Oleandra Street in Oława, can be for some mistakers.
To the true power the way is far away, but that's what one of the kinds of conventional rivalry is described...
The jump power competition is to overcome by the rider and horse increasing obstacles which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two metres.
It is worth noting that the long and still unbroken record of the world, which was established in 1949, by the Chilians Albert Laraguibel, on the horse ‘Huaso’, is 247 cm.
Of course, no one so high in Oława jumped, but the result of the best local amazone at 135 cm level doesn't belong to the worst...
The competitions organized by Mr Sienkiewicz and other players JKS "In the saddle" represented a show of some of the previously played "Team riding competitions", which we write more widely about in this issue of newspapers, on page 22.
Eight amazones, training drivers in JKs, joined competition.
Four of them competed in ponies, four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szałdra was best involved with a crazy "Sprinter".
This little, but how dynamic rumak began to overcome obstacles spread over a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a top beam separated from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it was easy to give up and only after three subsequent refusals, the jury was withdrawn from further competition.
The second place in the ponie jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, having a "Fama", and the third of Lena Borun on "Harmiderze".
Ambitically, she fought the youngest part of the tournament - Inga Aksman, swimming and jumping through the obstacles to the small mare "Carmen".
Even greater emotions were accompanied by the launch of Amazons and audiences during a competition involving large horses.
Paulina Shewczyk, who received the Declaration, and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to "Lotka", had a serious looking downfall.
Fortunately, aside from minor humiliations or amazons, nothing bad happened to horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Many problems with the introduction of the young "Winet" to the park had been encountered by Wernik Łukkiewicz.
There was a need for either an assist coach or another horse to a couple, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" would go.
After having counted obstacles from the park, she also had a full honor, so the moments in the boxing room and the relaxation room had become dangerous. “It is all under control!", he satisfied Jan Sienkiewicz a little of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Martha Masalska has been great at the park, having a beautiful “Whiska” show.
This good-looking mare, combined with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first one to skip 135 cm and it was the best in this moment the result of the competition.
At the same time, however, Paulina Szewczyk also included the same height on “Deklaration”, Veronika Łukkiewicz on “Wineta” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lotka”.
For the decoration of the flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these players went away together, and at the end, together with the Amazons on the poachers at Radecki march performed an excellent honorary round, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you.
Jędzietecki Sport Club “In Siodle” warmly thanks to the sponsors of the jump power contest during the XVI “Team Jędzietecki competitions”: the Municipal Office in Oława, the Waterworks and Canaling plant in Oława, the District Mayor and the company “Mustang”.
Max Koloko is cut off from the KWP patriotic Revolution of Max Kolko
KWW The patriotic Revolution Max Koloko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Marius Max Kolokynka was intended to go to the October parliamentary elections.
In particular, the revolution led its proposal to young voters on right-wing views.
He announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz before the elections, but none of these coalitions had happened, and he himself had not been able to collect enough signatures in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed on Twitter that he had completed his cooperation with KWW's patriotic Revolution Max Koloko.
"I will wait for the KWWW to delete my name from the name.
I would like to ask you not to connect my person with this entity," he added and announced that he would give more information soon.
So far, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On July 4, in the American Day of Independence, in the USA journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, informed about the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has heard from running on the YouTube channel Max TV, which comments the events in Poland and in the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolko said.
Among other things, there are issues in the party's programme of justice (they should be selected in universal elections), tax changes (comparation of tax free amount for all), military reparation (in the form of military assistance to NATO countries, with particular consideration for Poland), carrying out a referendum on weapons possession, reducing Members or the introduction of single-mandial constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko put on his profile in social media, suggesting that #R would combine forces with the movement of Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions finally happened.
UBS: Gold close to the balance point
“The euro will remain in the coming months in the vicinity of the ceiling of PLN 4,35, which will be accompanied by a weak continuance on global markets,” said Michael Bolliger with UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are for stabilising gold quotations on the current ceiling", says the specialist in the talks of Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite a clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide on the foot increases in the environment in which a vast majority of central banks are mitigated by politics.
"As long as gold is properly valued, euro quotations should remain in the coming months in the vicinity of the ceiling of 4.35 zł – there are so few attractive Polish bonds.
Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation on emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management, offers a much more favourable return on Poland’s securities.
According to a specialist, a major threat to the Polish economy is a deterioration in the world.
“Global slowdown can continue to grow, but there should not be a severe recession, and as far as possible the dynamics of GDP fall slightly below zero,” said Michael Bolliger.
"Inventors should be undermining global shares that could harm the lack of prospects for dealing with trade conflicts on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trumpa impeachment procedure and brexit.
Europe, according to the latest letter to the main management authority of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele, should be the most relatively weak among the stock markets.
"The shares in the euro area countries should act worse than the US because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowdown", we read the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hoss on the bond markets of the safest countries, the profitability of the German 10-year-olds has been reduced to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
In the long term, however, long-term securities should no longer have to decline, but only short-term, by mitigation of bank monetary policy.
The biggest field to the foot reduction has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the future.
The long-term balance for euro quotations is a ceiling of 1.29 USD, which would mean 19 percent of the potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect a further reduction in Fed's feet, which will result in a decline in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the dollar's strength in a long time, they may not allow deficits in current and budgetary accounts," said Michael Bolliger.

According to a document from the parliamentary office of the State Secretary at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition have been reinvented.
Among the military equipment still missing, there are among others: six universal MG3, 11 automatic rifles G3, four automatic rifles G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, 30 uf for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The concern was expressed by the vice-president, Martin Renner.
As the reporters told the RND, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “consistent”.
All the more so, as a result of the investigation, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these activities as a “serious balance sheet”.
In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatens the state's security and breach of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was rejected preparing attacks on top German politicians from extremely right-wing and racist motives.
In his “black list” of purposes that fell into the hands of the D.A., among other things, the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.

The crying kids on the plane.
How do you avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for those for whom travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.
By means of the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If this connection travels underages to the second year of age, the “an icon of a child” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or guardians of a seat.
Thus, the person using the service of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place separated from that held by the small man.
The BBC states that the lines have already informed about the failure of this solution.
"The icon of the child" shall not appear when the ticket has been reserved by a third party or if at the last moment a change of the aircraft has occurred.
As expected, the idea divided the interns.
Some Twitter users point to the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved using noise-reducing headphones.
They're children, we used to be them.
“We need to learn tolerance because we will soon need to use maps of seats for breathing lips, spitting mouths or drunks,” wrote the G Sundar.
One of the other interns noticed that he had once been disturbed by crying kids on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
Also, there is no lack of supporters of the Japanese Airlines solution.
"Thank you for warning me to the screaming children during the 13 hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major's loss after the travel agency's bankruptcy, Thomas Cook.
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on leave for Majora in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
As the representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearów Marc Ponts, among the 25,000 holidaymen who could not use their October leave in Majorca, there are also those who would travel indirectly with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their rest on the Major next month as German citizens and Scandinavian countries because of the collapse of the British company.
However, as Pont claims, since Thomas Cook, during November-April, did not direct tourists to the Baltic Island, losses for the local economy will be lower.
He pointed out that the Balears government had already opened negotiations with international operators on the "Gorca market" after the British operator's bankruptcy.
In October, the newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs because of the tourism crisis in Majorce.
About 800 are fired from Thomas Cook's office in Palmie.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook at many major hotels, the owners of the facilities demanded guests to pay an additional fee for the accommodation.
This situation has experienced, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balears government estimates that by Thursday, several dozens of hotels in Majorce have stopped operating at least until the end of October in connection with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper "Diario de Ibiza" indicates that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza, which worked with Thomas Cook, are not intended to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that he was working with 42 hotels on the island of British ballet.
On Wednesday the autonomous Balears authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region by EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the banking notice by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They have shown that the most affected tourists are in Majorce.
According to the Balears Government, Thomas Cook is responsible for local tourism companies, mainly to hotel operators, for the implementation of the agreements concerning July-September 2019 period, around EUR 5 million.

"Rz": The Smog hit the government
"Exfects of Clean Air" are low, and coal furnaces will dig up this winter like nothing," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
So far, 82 thousand proposals for funding of PLN 2 billion were made under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The applications accepted are worth more than PLN 915 million, says "Rz", referring to the Ombudsman's data.
As indicated by the newspaper, only part of the costs incurred is recovered from the programme.
The results of the reported report are coldly assessed as "gross".
Self-governments quoted by the “Rz” are looking for failures of “Clean Air” among others in too large red tape.
"The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, invoice sent by mail, possible sampling of implementation.
That would make things better", says Mayor Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
The activists from the Polish Smog alarm note that in the first year less than 1% of the proposed goal of the exchange of 3 million boilers.
As the programme notes, although the budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Environment and Water Protection Fund for this year, 1.4 billion PLN is reserved,” we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now the negotiation of the prices
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but not the end of our work", wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price”, added the Polish Minister.
Agreement for the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Forces have a total of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by the Lockheed Martin Group.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department agreed to sell them.
The Communication underlines that investment in support of national security and the US foreign policy by improving NATO's security, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is supposed to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, as well as related support components for logistics and training of personnel.
Lockheed Martin F-35 hunter
The thinker F-35 Lightning II produced by the Lockheed Martin Group is a single and single-engine multi-tasking fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission close to support, bombings and typically hunting air fighting tasks.
With the use of stealth hunter technology it is undetectable for short range radars.
Recently, fighters F-35 bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with an ageing F-16.
The purchase of American combat aircraft is to consider other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotype.
Glander dolls
The Barbie producer introduced a series of sexual neutral dolls on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes like that.
The Barbie manufacturer introduced a series of sexual neutral dolls on the market
Next to Barbie with different colors of leather, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced neutral sex dolls to sell.
The "Creatable World" toys wear wigs.
So children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
The dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
The gender characteristics are also highlighted – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and thin tops or, in the case of Kena, wide arms.
The company thinks that children don't like their dolls to wear sexual standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a particular gender mind inhibit the ambition of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," Mattel says.
Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in bathing dress and shoes on a high village, has been repeatedly criticised in the past to promote "inferior female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.
The concert has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijaba.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together can have several Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to Sejm from the left-wing group list (KW SLD from which the candidate list for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Lefty Together, starting with the common logo “Lewica”), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
“I believe the outcome of the Left One will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levica is not only right, but has strength,” he noted.
Zandberg says that the leftman can have 60-80 Members.
“This could mean that a circle or a club together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on Polak and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked whether Levica will have a separate circle, Zandberg answered: “We are set up to be diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity is not there.
I think that the diversity of Poles has been rewarded because we have shown that when we differed, we have been able to agree on the joint agenda."
Questions whether the largest beneficiary of the joint launch are the leader of the SLD Włodórk Čarzasty, Zandberg replied that, according to him, the largest beneficiaries are the centroplewic and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, it is the SLD that gets all the subsidies, and he said that "the objective of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in elections to Sejm.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he indicated that he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse, and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart continues,” he said.
"But I know very honestly and clearly that if I had found myself in district 44 of the Senate, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," stressed the politicians.
"I would not be tempted to give my voice to Minister Kazimierz Ujadowski (the KO-PAP candidacy)" he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leaders of the RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki of PiS are launched.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by buses, cars and walking to the Bopp district, where the new mosque was built, which could hold 30,000 faithful.
The building was built by the duke Mouride, belonging to the Suficial nurt of Islam, which dominates in Senegal.
Work on the mosque started ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, passed by the government.
The name of the Mosque of Massaliku Jinan ("The Path to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of the Sheikh Ahmad Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, worshiped by the followers as holy.
The Mosque is surrounded by the Carrarian marble and has five minerals.
The highest of them is 78 meters tall.
The bridge is located in the middle of the 15 thousand faithful, and the other one can be on an external escalade.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the paid dome, giant chandeliers and hand-made decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in Western Africa, but there is no comparison to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can hold 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost over EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, apart from the ground, has provided for lighting, sanitary equipment and financing road works worth EUR 10,5 million.
Coach Slid: Our problem is not Silesia, it's just us.
The eight league match pass without the winner of the Korona football team will try to stop at a Friday meeting with the Vice-President of the Silesian Extraclass.
"Our problems are not reincarnation, but we ourselves have to work on what we play," said Coach Mirosław Smyła.
The final players of the Crown and, so far, the only victory in the league had been recorded in the first round when they defeated the 1:0 beneficial game of Częstochowa Raków.
Later, the waiters recorded two drawbacks and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Lubin Deep in 1/32 of the Polish Cup final.
"I'm being optimistic about the fact that, in the last seconds, football players have been fighting for the goal, they've been trying to reset.
Their fall on the torture after the last whistle didn't result from a breakdown, only it was the fall of anger because they were so close," Smash said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be allergic to the game team in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play", added the trainer.
In the Friday match in Koron, it certainly will not take a break for the excess of the yellow cards of Ognjan Gnjatic, there will also be no injury to Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
It is builder, however, to report to a cup game of several players with the desire to play.
“We have headaches, recently it seemed not to be, and now it is,” said Smash.
The defender of the Crown Daniel Strangel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break eight league games in a row without victory, while in extraclass everyone can win with everyone.
"We're a good team.
In recent weeks, we may not show this on the field, but this moment will come that we will win, and we believe it will be on Friday," said the footballer.
After nine lines, the crown's extraclass with a total of five points takes 15.

The fifth match in Kielce starts at 10.30 a.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of European tree species are at risk," warns the International Nature Protection Union (IUCN) published on Friday "The Red Book of European Trees".
The leaves are for example chestnut and slurry.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of threatened species of European trees for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% is "at a high level".
The Red Paper mentions the rapid expansion of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, these trees and bushes, which occur only or mainly on our continent, are the most at risk.
As regards the typical European tree tree, 58% of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of dying, according to IUCN experts.
The Red Paper’s main causes include faults in the use of woodcuts, fast urbanisation, too intense wood cutting, and, in the future, forest fires and changes in the European ecostism.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a great threat to the existence of many European varieties of bushes, moss and growth.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European species of plants and create a danger in Europe to avoiding important and underestimated varieties, which are the basis for European ecosystems and affecting the health of our planet", concluded the Luc Bas report, which led the European Office of IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetina: I will not promise 600+
"The PiS today wants to bribe Poles, offering them for freedom of distribution to credit that will have to pay off future generations", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole P.S. policy is beer".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is data will not be taken".
Schetyna assures in his conversation with Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.
It's all about mobilizing the electricity at constituency.
In his view, the opposition has more potential than the Kaczyński party.
“The present people who are conscious who want to live in a normal country are more than the supporters of the PiS, a party that has put up with declared values, such as modesty, humility, transparentness,” says Schen.
The Civilian Coalition Leader and president of the Civil Platform also identified the basic foundation of the electoral programme of the KO.
"First of all, nothing will be taken, but you need to set the direction for the future, because PiS is only taking care of the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is obvious even after a dramaticly low investment", he said.
Secondly, it is "the launch of the energy of Poles, the aid and investment in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurs".
The Scheme explains that there was a project in the KO program, which the least earning Poles will give more than 614 zloty on the hand, and more earners – also for several hundred.
The politician also noted that he did not want to pursue the transfer.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the ruling bided the opposition to the distribution until the end of the financial decline of the country," he stressed.
In the interview “Rz” he also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would rent them with hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride of the crotch before the fall.
Kaczyński is the husband of the state, as Banas is crystal," he added.
Lider PO also said that he had not yet decided whether he would apply for a board of directors of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Big Condors
In the Argentinan province of Santa Cruz, six dead large condors were found – reports TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Condors large are likely poisoned by a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten toxic padline.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were an adult.
"This is a great loss for the environment because a condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fruitful and able to reproduce.
So we lose the protected species, the species threatened", says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, Argentina's environmental organisation.
"I think that the use of toxic baits and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has been on the award of your precious chain's head.
The idea was supported by the cancelaria Andrzej Duda – we read “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the White Eagle Order, the royal insignia officially called during the interwaral jewel of the Republic.
Last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Mostite.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Duda's arms.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday's proposal to work on the amendment of the Law on Wars and Awards to restore it.
The log says it's not the first attempt to restore this chain of state.
The Senate has already proposed such an amendment, but it has lost one vote.
This time the work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators dedicated a few minutes of this matter to the President's office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I would be polite to inform you that the President of the Republic of Poland would not comment on the position presented in this petition," said Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued to discuss a little time.
"The President's office has answered us briefly: it's for bringing this back," said the chief of committee Robert Mátow of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He requested legislative work which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through crossroads
Police action will be carried out, among others, at the crossroads of Al. Ciepliński, from Al. Piłsudski.
The uniform activities have been linked to recent complaints by the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27th, the police begin their preventive action in the Reich on the Passover Crossroad.
This is to eliminate the obstacles in traffic: crossing without the possibility of exit, failure to comply with light signals or traffic signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we really make life difficult for other drivers", said Marek Ustobiński, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words went off at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of the inadequate movement of cars at the crossroads, which, in effect, creates traffic jams.
The president then appealed to travellers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write texts while driving.
The theme was taken over by Roman policemen who are starting the "While Crossing" action from now on.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of the limitation of crossroads by drivers entering without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offence that contributes to the power of the obstacles to traffic and traffic creation.
It is threatened with a mandate of 300 zł and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to failure to comply with traffic signals or signs and incorrect parking in the crossroads area.
There will also be a lack of liquidity driving, late moving from below the signals, free cross-country crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
On what crossroads will action be carried out?
M., at Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellonska street; al. Cieplinský z al. Piłsudskiego; ul. Targowa of al. Piłsudski; Sreniavitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or from Hetmanský ul.
Such shares in Podkarpacia capital will be held next Friday October.
They checked the company that made the waste out of the "Czki"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of the Vołomiński and the District Construction Surveillance Inspection have checked on Friday's installation in Zielonka County, where waste from the water treatment plant "Czák" in Warsaw, informs the spokesperson of Vołomiński's mayor Karol Szszko.
Inspectors from the Włominski mayor carried out control at a plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka municipality.
The private commercial and transport plant "Dar-Trans", under contracts with a table-based waste treatment plant "Cyžka" performs water treatment services.
"The installation could also be examined, and an entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities", said Szszko.
He added that the check-in report would be forwarded, inter alia, to the Warsaw Military Environment Inspector.
The last "Dar-Transie" check was carried out by the Military Environment Inspector in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater and did not have the results of a stabilised municipal sewage sediment from the water treatment plant.
Following the inspection of the VIIAS Dariusz Saturday, he was called to cease the violation of the terms of the decision.
The private commercial and transport plant "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sediments from the treatment plant "Cajka".
In accordance with the decision to carry out waste disposal in the production area, waste of up to 60,000 tonnes per year in forests near Zielonka.

Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken a difficult task, you can count on my total support," said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawy-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr. President, this is very important to me," replied the candidate for the Civil Coalition to the Prime Minister, leader of the list KO in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that in terms of the situation in Poland, this is now a "tillion to retirement".

Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will be maximum support for your actions", said the former president, returning to Kidawa-Błońska.
A very important word
Kidawa-Błońska thanked her for her support.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word for me, because no one like you can speak of freedom, of constitution, and knows what the importance of this is," she said.
“Let’s show that we can do another smart policy, together, but according to the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with the respect of others.
The Lord did his revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidawa-Błońska.
Kibic retired
In his conversation with the journalists he said he was now a "tillion to retirement."
“ Of course, I am looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the event, that what was good, checked, (to do so) we will return.
The three divisions of power are the most important, the Constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And it all needs to be cleaned, and it all needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we're going to do it.
Because if we don't, we're going to have a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
"That's why it's so important that Poles go to the elections, think and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that we will improve the state of the situation in Poland by the card," replied the former president.
"We must build a new foundation"
She asked the most important questions about the changes that should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President has said very well.
We need to build a new foundation, where we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and lead it to become obvious and so that everyone knows that Poland will not take a step forward."

Vitala Heynen's caretaker's way out of the title closed a Thursday failure with the Slovenians 1:3 in Lublin.
It was about their travel problems for this duel.

According to the relationship between people present in class, the world champion training has been nervous.
As the assistant Heynen Mikhal Miszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of the volleyball elements itself.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild all of this as a team," he wrote.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both players and training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
We're disappointed without two sentences.
We still believed we were going back to the game.
We were discussing this game between each other in a fight, the coach talked a lot to the players.
As two main causes of failure, I would point out the inefficiency of the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situation ball.
The Slovenians were much better than us," he analysed.
In his view, the "Bela-red" was not stress-related to the performance against the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament.
He admitted that the masters of the world could have slightly put a smooth way to the semifinal.
“It may be that in the group phase, if we had a similar style failure, we would have studied this lesson faster and later, otherwise, we would have played in the next phase of the tournament.
But that's just when he was fucking," he warned.
Gogol hopes that anger associated with the fourth defeat of Poles will manage to break into aggression in a bronze game.
“I hope we can show our true faces then.
There's nothing to fight about.
The last ME medal we won in 2011", he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is a third country visited by Poles during these championships.
During the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two group meetings went to Apeldoorn, and the semifinal moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: a severe punishment, but in suspension
An Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on takeoffs and a fine of $25,000 – in half a year's suspension – for demanding words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tours lose their patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most uncircumcised professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus fines, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a criminal athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been apart for a long time and he's made his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in his history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behaviour on the court and alongside him.
The loud curses, strange gestures, unsportable behavior, insulting the judge and the viewers, breaking two missiles during the losing match with Karen Chaczan – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113 000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play long, but was able to publicly say that ATP activists “sorrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they had put in place a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they had given that verdict about suspension of launches and another fine.
But words of corruption were forgiven for him after hearing the guilty and learning the context of the speech.
In the justification of the tennis activists, however, the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgios over the whole 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost continuous violations of the rules that, without interruption, he insulted people in the form of tournament and viewers, hence high punishment.
The ATP, however, gave him five days to bring an appeal and immediately delayed the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfilment within the next six months of several conditions: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, there can no longer be a breach of the rules of the Code of Conduct of the existing professional tennis professionals, in particular, it can no longer curse, destroy missiles, argue with judges and audience, nor any other way to behave unpunished and vulgar.
He also recommended that he look for “an increasing support” from mental trainers during the tournaments and also consults outside the season on those who specialize in solving problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behaviour.
The first comment (in social media) of Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, Australians will have at least two weeks break, since Lavera’s Cup sharpened his shoulder injury, so he had to resign from the nearest start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
It's 27th place in the ATP Kyrgios ranking.
This year he won two tournaments – Washington and Acapulco, earned over 1.3 million bucks, so even after the fines he'll stay a lot.
GUS: Poland is growing better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the GUS shows that as a good or rather good material situation it assessed up to 44% of them.
This percentage was 37.2% in 2016, 33.5% in 2016, and earlier since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the household situation, it was never more than 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households employed on their own account is best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole, there are household rencists, where the response rate was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is to be seen to parents alone raising offspring, of which the good or rather good material situation declares 32%.
Between couples with children this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) between 55 and 60% and 48.8% of children's households.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (2016) the worst material situation was assessed by parents alone raising offspring and families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear difference between income levels and the assessment of household material conditions at voivodship level.
The best evaluation is designed by the inhabitants of Opolskie voivodship, where the situation is good or rather considered to be 48.9% of the surveyed population.
There are also Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and westernpomorskie (47.1%).
However, in Opole, budgetary income (i.e. after tax and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and in Lubusek 98%.
The highest revenues had the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian average (104%).
On average, in Poland, the available income per person was PLN 1693.
In real terms (after the adjustment to the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
In the past years, the score is pretty low.
In 2016, income to a person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These figures per person were PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
It is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure on persons increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016.
The investigation of household budgets suggests that the statistical household is currently spending 70.1% of its budgetary income, while in 2014 the share was above 80% and by 2006 exceeded 90%.

United States: Three suicides among airport crews
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board the USS George H. W. Bush ship, informing the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members have been killed.
Previous suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November 2017.
As CNN says, all three sailors shot each other last week.
Each event occurred on land when the U.S.S. George H. W. Bush snuck off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third party participation has been excluded.
In addition, death should not be associated.
"The need for everyone to engage in the presentation of suggestions and ideas as to how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to emphasise that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to the search for help", said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship commander on Facebook.
Niesiłoowski critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his speech with Piotr Zyszecki Stefan Niesiłowski, he stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"Every sentence of it was accepted accordingly."
Later, some of his actions have been criticised.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Riszyk, being a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this re-dempertoryist – the pestilence of the Church and Poland – has developed his media in the best of still life of Pope Polak", he explained.
Former POs acknowledged: “There were clouds of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Ryzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, like his successors," explained Niesiłowski.
"This fatal matter of pedophilia and Church activities has come to an end, and they are actually missing.
I ran out a little thinking ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to his entire life.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know these disgusting matters," says the journalist Niesielowski.
In the evaluation of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
"We must admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, all the places hanged the cross.
Now these crosses are pistachio, they have become the symbol of the dictatory – the sign of the writeric regime.
I repeat: one of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that people like the Knights of the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing on this matter and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay for him," he convinced Niesiłowski.
"I hope Pope Francis chases Jęduszewski, Ryzyk and a few others," he summed up.

Gryf disqualified
As part of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk, a small hair did not end tragically, when the fans from Wejherowa raca passed the goalkeeper of the opposite team, Zlatan Alomeric.
After this incident, the match was stopped for 20 minutes.
By examining this case, the PZPN has measured Gryf's severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start at the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed in the nearest game at their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to league games till December 31st.
Burdy was also a fan of Silesian Wizzewa Łódź at the stadium.
However, the judgment of PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and was taught by the competent authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the ship to be robbed by the Latvian crews, the burning of chairs and the fortification of the economy sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use the water cannons.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organization of trips to matches including and the next release of PP.
The ban also included the league matches of the Extractas, but it will continue there until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Reichs
Podkarpacie started implementing the Regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, inter alia, the recording of foreign names on road signs in Poland as well.
For example, "Lws" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs on the motorway A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, clearer and easier.
The new guidelines stem from the revision of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of villages in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change we're about to make, they'll finally appear on the roads on our roads.
The introduction of a new marking begins with the subkarpackian section of the A4 motorway", informs Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
The 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200,000 PLN.
In the first place, a new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, as planned by 1 November 2019.
What does the idea look like?
It's going to happen without replacing the board, on the record.
They will replace the current names of the new localities, written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be saved in one row – first in Polish, and then in original, in peacock.
This will be a lot of easier for people who do not know the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill.
In the pond in Zamecna, in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants saw a swan having problems with wings.
After being fished and seeing at the vet it turned out that someone had set up an animal purpose – there was a blowout from the windmill was found in his body.
"The early bird received information from the village residents from the Rehabilitation Centre for Wild Animals in New Sola.
According to a report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the scene.
Right away, you could see something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to put additional stress at risk.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a firearm out of him.
In his body there were fragments of the hemorrhage," says Marcin Walesek, Chairman of the Malpol company managing, among others, the rehabilitation centre.
Plays at the centre
"The wounds have been cleansed, the bird has been given antibiotics, provision of access to water, safe place in the centre where he spends all the winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly yet.
Released now would have involved him, he probably wouldn't have survived winter," added Valasek.
After being subjected to a splinter of rehabilitation, he intends to release him for spring to the same pond.
After receiving information on the contribution of the animal’s ill health, the gmina of Żukowice intends to inform the prosecutor of the matter.
The event occurred in Zamenczna
Gowin: "We must wake up Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be considered whether the State has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
During the call in the Day Signals, Gowin stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
Given that this problem was very difficult to fight, Deputy Prime Minister pointed out that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of its term of office, but he received the "Contratra by the EC".
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and the government formalises, we will return to that subject", he said.
He also pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland, so small trade".
"It will have to be considered if the government has some tools to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court of Justice concluded that the European Commission made a mistake considering that the Polish tax on retail sales was inadmissible to public aid.
The retail tax law provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% from revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 % from income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was due from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated an infringement procedure by Poland.
Brussels argued at that time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then stated that the tax was introduced in an illegal manner.
It also issued a tax suspension order until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland refused to agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May EU Court Decision opened the way for the reintroduce of the tax but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged a appeal in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU submitted the PAP that the case is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure is moving, namely listening to the parties and possible hearings.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the date of the appeal to the judgment.
"This is the case for an average year", said PAP in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to dress a baby for baptism?
We are making some practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
Often, it is the first time around the child that entire family is concentrated together celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder the newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best that day.
However, before you decide on the child’s dress, consider whether it will be comfortable.
In stores you can find many mechanical kites that do not provide the little one proper comfort.
So what should we consider?
The basic criterion for selecting a baptism dress is the age of a child.
Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptized, dressed in white sets and placed in the same barrels or big pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months, one year, and even more.
It's hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs a little different baptism dress.
So if your child will have 3-4 months of baptism on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the celebration in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or the baptismal ones.
The best way to do this is to make it comfortable, cotton sleeping or composites.
Although this element of wardrobe is considered to be a daily outfit, it is sufficient to find its sacred options, for example, with a banner or lace.
For a boy, it'll be perfect for points with a piece of flies and butter.
In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in your dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, ticulic dress.
Many of the parents of a girl with a masculine look to the richly decorated, falsified dress for baptism in a complex with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers for their product use artificial, non-inhaling materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the appropriate dress, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on cotton cushions.
Genuine, ticulous skirts, satanic dresses, laces, apps and lovely kites will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect dress for small gentlemen: cotton suits
Until recently, there was fashion among the parents of the boys on suits, which are a copy of the "old" models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or stunts often made young elegances manifest their disgruntled disgruntled.
Today, fortunately, they have been pulled out by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, dressing shorts, and in this shirt decorated in front of the vest pattern.
These machines look extremely sacred, but at the same time they don't contaminate the movement of a little world.
Krystyna Pawlovič published a property statement

As a result of the statement made by the Member, it draws a monthly pension of 4,7 thousand PLN.
Pawlowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and a slightly smaller apartment that rents, receiving PLN 880 per month.

Previously, Jarosław Kaczynski published the property statement.
Voting over the sitting at the time of the Conservative Party conference
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day session of the House of Gmin during the annual Conservative Party program conference, which the government asked for.
There were 289 Members, against – 306.
Normally, the House of the Gmin does not hold part-sessions during the conference, so that Members do not have to resign or participate in them or the Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that at the same crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the session.
On the request of the government for a break, 289 Members spoke, against them it was 306.
Two opposition parties already after the convention
The lack of consent for a break can be considered as a political revenge against the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson as his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was recognised by the Supreme Court as illegal and absent) and for not wanting to apologize for it.
Following that judgment, the House of Gmin resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was the speech of Johnson and the following a stormy debate.
Johnson left the opposition to the banxite blocking and avoiding early-term elections.
“It’s time to make the return.
It has to be accomplished to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit has to come so that we can take care of the agreement on the priorities of the people, the health service, the cost of life.
Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country", said Johnson.
The Conservative Party Conference is to start in Manchester on Sunday and take place on Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson gave to clarify this long suspension of Parliament was just part-time conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” writes foreign media.
The president's spokesperson has definitely commented on these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter by Błaże Spychalski.
Israel’s media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post,” referring to the “Jewish Insider”, writes that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, declared that Israel was guilty of recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katza, who stated in February that “the Poles sent anti-Semitism with the milk of mothers”.
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel had failed to apologize for the humiliating statements of his politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression at the Polish ambassador in Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polak, Polak."
"The quote is not only inconspicuous.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter Bžej Spychalski.
He stressed that Duda had never said that Israel was responsible for recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
According to the Spychal portal, "it's come up with this."
According to the speakers, during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the survivors of the Holocaust, awarded by the Commander's Cross of Order of the Podsi of the Republic of Poland, Edward Mosberg and the Rabbi Shmulley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda's words and say that the Jews from Israel “such as Israel Kac” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was supposed to stop Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banas and what's he responsible for?
The stoner leased by the basements led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banas.
We're gonna summarize the next affair that shakes the command camp.
TVN's Journalists revealed that Marian Banasz, the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has in recent years not entered the property statement of the 400-meter building located on the Krakow Podgórze.
Moreover, his subcontractor had to lead in the above-mentioned sexbiznes stone (and so rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been allegedly a guarantee of repayment since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Superwizjer" program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia's building, people have rented a relationship with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Banas' charges were not clear and vague.
Interestingly, the stoner rented by the basements led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Banasia.
The building itself was described in them unexplained, and the income from the rental was to be destroyed.
“Mother Mariana Banasia and his wife could be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, spouses can boast two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia stone itself was worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anticorruption Office is currently carrying out checks on the property statements of Marian Banasia for the years 2015-2019.
Banesek announced that until she was finished, he would hang up his work in an NIC. “I will go to your marshal for free leave,” he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We can’t hear CBA expand its investigation or accelerate the examination of Marian Banasia’s property statements.
That is why we are forced to hand out the authorities of the state and report on the possibility of a crime [...]", said Mr P-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Polak had so badly valued his rental properties, he would already have 10 controls, the tax dome and the conduct of the group," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Board of Control.
This position was set up on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term of office.
His candidate was tabled by the Law and Justice and by the politicians of this party adopted.
He was previously associated with NI between 1992 and 2005., he acted in this institution as a co-workers of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first reign of PiS (2005-2008) Banešz was the Chairman of the Customs Service and also the Under Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he returned to the head of Customs Service to the table, and since 2017 he managed the National Treasury Administration.
Banas served as Minister of Finance in Mateusz Morawiecki's government for three months.

"Rzeczpospolita": The ignoring of a police officer will be punished
As the newspaper says, disregarding a court order issued by a policeman is to be a new type of offence, a threat of fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
When you make a change like this, they want a police union.
The idea came to the House Committee on Petitions.
"The truth is serious, because every year more than half a million crimes are being brought into Polish courts," we read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" determined that the petition, which the Independent Police Union writes to Members on the amendment of the Code of Crime, has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording for Article 54a of the Code of Crimes.
It would say: “Whoever does not submit to a request or a command of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the laws of the law, is subject to arrest, fine or restriction of freedom.”
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who do not execute orders, prevent or hinder the execution of a business,” says the journal.
Socjologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the provision, he is afraid that if implemented, he can be used in political manifestations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be disadvantageous and instead of facilitating the situation, even to make it worse,” adds.
The statistics given by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have been positive at police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions per month are taking place in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
I want Topol in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar Czech dramamakers, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
Hence, Jáchym had the curse of talent from the beginning, which he was trying to use.
After eight years, he came back from "While Man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, travelling across Europe.
He's a fan of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a single translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys since birth did not make a sound, and for the next time he stopped in non-fifth days.
But it's not the heroes that are the most important in this story.
Everyone is only a background to watch a world where there is no room for artistic cocktails.
It's a world of incendiary provinces, society of old, suspicious people, and a solution to young people.
The “Insightful Man” places turn into an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates the Didaskalia, and the characters' conversations create this world.
Europe is full of concern for its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy by Thomas Cook
Although Thomas Cook's British travel agency has fallen, his Belgian filia Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
As the VRT reports, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holiday trips will be able to get the money back.
The General Court in Gandawa also announced the collapse of three Belgian companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12 thousand Belgs are abroad on trips bought at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "permanent" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British mother company, which caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office satisfied that the customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced the collapse of the night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the break-up of last chance with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
In addition to the already agreed rescue plan of £900 million, creditors claimed that the company would receive an additional £200 million as a guarantee for the winter period when travel agents normally have a lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, which has resulted in a debt of £1.6 billion.

We're the ones who played very little.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – this extraordinary offer has been prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
Action is intended to help combat the progressive decline in the population population.
Görlitz is the eastmost town of Germany.
A beautiful pastel star attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city struggles with major problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with the permanent population rate.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which translated into a 25% decline in the city population.
In 2013, it was 54 000 people.
In order to compete with the population, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the programme is concerned, 150 proposals have taken place.
Two thirds of them were the inhabitants of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
"When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the participants of the project.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has 7 thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than averages in the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will be ongoing, the main objective of the programme is to get the views of the participants.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – about what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the ideas of attracting new inhabitants, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced the programme to pay the promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy or in the U.S. Tulsa, Oklahoma.
