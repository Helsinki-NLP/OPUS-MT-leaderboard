Barack Obama gets as the fourth US President of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American president in history.
Diplom, medal and check for 1.4 million dollars will, among other things, receive special efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between the nations.
The White House chief will arrive at the Norwegian metropole in the morning and with Michelle's wife, and he'll be careful.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President's couple then have a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will be completed with the ceremony, which Obama will receive prestigious awards.
He gets it as the fourth American president, but only the third one that gets the prize right at the office.
The White House has already observed that Obama will speak about the Afghan War during the reception of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he realizes that the price takes over as the president, who is currently fighting in two countries.
War effort a few days ago has increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget any of his criticisms.
During Obama's ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to do charity, but he hasn't decided the specific charity yet.
The charged programme will then lead the President with the Chosen One to the banquet, where, besides the Norwegian King and the Queen, the Prime Minister and the other 250 guests will also be invited.
From the beginning, Obama has been more relentlessly built to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not only a price for him, but for all who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was called to act for him.
A Protector of Nature accused of extortion
The Lithuanian Police accused the president of the Civil Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice from extortion.
In a few cases last year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawal of appeals required money from investors for his benefit, said the litre police spokesman Alena Romová.
Lubomír Studnička is presiding the Litoměre Society of Nature Protectors.
He's in custody now, and he's in danger for up to three years in prison.
Non-inflammable containers of Brno
In Prague, ordinary people can sort out the packaging of drinks, you will meet the sorting containers for every step in South Moravian villages.
And in Brno?
There you can reserve a few minutes before you can find the suitable ashtrays.
I don't mean to say there's no trouble in Brno.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, counseling about this problem is not enough.
Brno is in the forest line of sorting of waste, not only by still throwing paper, glass and plastic in the class containers as citizens.
Have you ever tried to throw PET bottles in a collection basket in the centre, for example?
It's a piece of work, and it's all taking time and nerve.
The only place I've hit so far is in the Moravian Square across from Potrefené Hus.
Don't let Mr. Order and her colleagues get mad at me, but I feel like a hell of a lot.
Not to mention, even in other parts, there is no honey sorting.
A lot of my friends don't feel that bad.
On the left.
It's because they're far away from the ashtrays.
I don't blame them.
I offered myself after the celebration to fire a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful ashtrays on Kounice Street.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on the way to the road.
However, the waste came from it.
It's still the center of Brno that represents the city most, isn't it?!
But environmentalism and some aesthetics probably don't care much about Brno socialists.
These cities prefer to buy a hockey extract that will make us a disgrace across the country than they would buy a few extra containers and offer a classification of other raw materials for Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my opinion with official statistics after a moment of internet cracking.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravian Region.
"Paroubk's" budget took the money for pensions and sickness
After having added the left hand, despite the Government’s view to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also on interest on government debt or international court disputes.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the finance minister Eduard Janota.
When the social Democrats and the communists increased to some groups, they relied on the fact that the government would lend additional money to vulnerable expenditures, pensions or sickness. "It is only a delay of problems to the future, putting mines into line," Janota says.
The money borrowed is becoming more and more interest and has to come back sometimes.
There's not much choice to take on, there's no state.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or costs of running the State, it must raise taxes.
To all whom the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And then their children.
Retirement or sickness, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, does not need to be feared, they will get them.
But at the cost of becoming more indebted – next year, it will not miss only 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, this debt will grow more and faster and, along with it, the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it and will not be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce motherhood as the government did in its anti-deficitious package.
Five billion will also be missing for the construction of highways and railways next year due to the shifts of money in favour of several groups of voters.
These are mostly already embossed and disassembled sections that are not redesigned and, if necessary, fall short.
At most, to end, which is also not free.
It means delay or stopping thirty large buildings, and it also threatens to draw European money, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelk.
ČSSD suggested that the loss of money will be resolved by Solomonian – it reaches the CEZ dividend, which the state of its own most, and it will contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is, the dividend above is never sure, and it's not a bottomless source at all.
Last year, CEZ came to the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, environmental damage disposal is applied from dividends, pension account is added or used as a reserve for retirement reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to 5,7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of movements does not end.
Almost three billion have been left in the budget for various damages by the victims of communism and crimes or expenses for court disputes, even for construction burns.
If there's any way I can get around without that money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we're gonna have to pay anyway, it's Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or in worst case touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing on the already launched two-billion project The Treasury is to enable online monitoring of what individual offices spend.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, there will be sanctions, warning Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans in the future count with a mobile phone on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
The exposed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you can move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This option is aimed at the aim of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them up to your home and work.
They will both work at one and the same moment, suggested Srinevas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented last November and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a sample of smartphones with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, on which Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
The VMware company now cooperates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and to customers should get to them during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains troubles hotels
The girls' slopes don't only worry about the Krkonose walkers.
The missing snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains, free rooms are still available for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our website.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask us if we think Christmas will be on the snow or in the mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a silvestrian stay in Špindler's Mill exactly according to his idea should not hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers money savings and accommodation quality is in the second place, he can try to wait a few days.
Špindlerov hotels offer only weekly stays at Silvestra.
I think they'll try to turn them over for a while, but then they'll allow them to go for a shorter period.
And then the rooms will go up quickly," he estimated Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're interested in the most Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
That's half the seats left in our offer.
That is why we have already made some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Director Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Giant Mountains can still offer a high-level travel agency, but less available places are available.
The first 14 days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays negatively influences that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on snow-free mountains.
If they are snowed during the week of the slopes, Christmas is sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is better than last year to accommodate the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better at it.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve.
The great interest is about Polish holidays in January and is also well sold February," said the director of the best hotel Karel Rad.
The Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně has 80 percent.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half the beds are still available in the latest Read more
We were pleasantly surprised by the January, which we have now occupied about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February so far, but once the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely rise, the director of the Hotel Omnia Erik Sporrysch said.
However, for the greater share of snow, the Krkonoše hotels so far have to let taste go.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday, if there's any precipitation, there's supposed to be snow on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech hydrometheorological Institute.
USA: Repacking is a mother of wisdom
It is comical, with what kind of schooling effort Barack Obama, the President with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered himself the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his yearningly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out to have been described over a copycat from Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself several times uses the word phrase "as in Iraq", but did he not even hesitate to use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New journey forward".
He criticized Bush himself three years ago with the idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq as "unresponsible and in his follow-up strategic decisions".
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and successful enough that he was not talking about Iraq today in the news reports.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but objectively left a much more grateful starting situation to his successor than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that a miracle will happen again.
He was again asked by the Field Commanders, especially the Chief Commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination of the sub-ordination, criticized the weighty shooter in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation to the better.
The president hesitated three months, but he didn't fall any better, so at least he tricked the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to challenge the promise of another 5,000, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase will give the same fruit as the course in Iraq.
Despite the Brotherly Wars of the past years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders of honor.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - no one can rely on and no agreement can be applied.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are used to changing the master every day according to how they fit it.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a pamphlet village, for which they will continue to face the patriarchal tribal relations.
The consideration of the interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely complex given the inadequacy of the differences which are even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building an "active state", which is a minimal objective of the entire operation, doesn't seem to be too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy reflects its selectarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the edge of the explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the war wreaths for the purpose of "a slow return home" will cause a miracle made here, can only a soul truly romantic, untied.
From a political point of view, the determination of the date of withdrawal of the troops in a clear sense is that the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of America's defeat.
NATO’s last NATO summit has shown that Europeans’ willingness to participate in fighting operations in Afghanistan is looking for a minus.
European politicians do not and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Indian Mountains.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions on Iran do not act, it will rise before the United States overly question whether it will not try to solve the problem by military force.
She's going to have to be answered at a time when Obama says America's winning withdrawal from Afghanistan is going to come.
However, every such solution will also mean the dramatic turnover in the Afghan situation.
The only example for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and that is why there is still enough time left to come up with another strategy if this is shown to be a total fallout.
Goldman Sachs bank managers can't get cash
The top US officials of Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash this year.
It was announced by a company that responds to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive instead of money shares that will be possible to sell first in five years.
Moreover, the shares may be taken to managers in case they risk excessively.
According to the Reuters Agency Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs is facing a long-term effort to connect the reward to Wall Street.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to be given, said the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became a target of criticism after the first three quarters of this year she took aside almost $17 billion ($300 billion) for rewards.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to the Reuters Agency, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge bankers' bonuses over £25,000 (from around CZK 712.000) to charge 50 percent of the tax at one time.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
In Stockholm, five women today took over from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden. Gustaf Nobel Prizes in professional categories and literature.
In addition to four scientists there was also German writer of Romanian origin Hert Muller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two U.S. biopsies Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the area of chromosomals.
Israel's price for chemistry was given to Ada Jonathan, along with the Americans of Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and functions of the ribosomas.
The final winner was the Nobel Prize for the economy that American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson had won for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around this year without the holder was physics.
Today, Charles Kao's scientists took this award for research in optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded took over a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of profit of a financial reward.
For each category, this amount to CZK 10 million in Swedish crowns (EUR 25 million).
If there are more awarded in each of them, they share the reward.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel Peace Prize received an American President Barack Obama this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversiality of his appreciation, because it is only at the beginning of its course and is in the head of the country leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in defence of his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for the fight against peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering demisi. Klaus invited him to Castle
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janot, who is considering his insistence in the government because they disagree with the form of the state budget for the next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's remaining in the cabin will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget criticises Klaus too.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by President's spokesperson, Radim Ocvat.
Janota wants to act with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the law on the budget, which Klaus will now get to the signature, the Czech Republic should handle the $163 billion deficit.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to proposals on the left to transfer money and increased the money to public employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has encroached proposals for social democracy that hides budget deficits.
Between the left and the government, Klaus, and the right hand side on the other hand, there was a sharp intrapolitic dispute, due to which the question mark was about the further effect of Fischer's official cabin, on which the formations of the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
The critic claims that the budget, as the House has adopted it, is essentially destroying a package of austerity measures that the Fischer Government has established in autumn and which it believes is to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign, for today's discussion breakfast with the entrepreneur, stated that politicians had been neglecting a "serious problem" which is "ineligible deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government, which, moreover, could lean on the wider consensus of the political parties, is the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečas said ČTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and green people obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "a powerful statement".
Chief of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek in saying that the terrible is the deficit of the budget that the former Topolán government has prepared for this year and which will exceed CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in the Clint Eastwood News
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus: The invincible will turn out a lot about the world, its fights and victories despite some criticisms that the major roles of American actors.
The story tells us about sport, race relationships, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandel in his life story represents the oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 21-year-old Mandela asked him to be in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another major role in it.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, the twenty-one-year-old actor, who won the role of the Eastwood drama from the world of the Million Dollar Baby box, has already recorded a leader in the movement for the abolition of slavery from which he finally became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in the Virgin Evans, but only rarely someone who still lives and is as important for many people as Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active job at the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and then became the president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is the Latin word for the unharmed, and it is the name of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like he did.
The scene is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with captain of South Africa's ragby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandel knows that his nation still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he decides to unite the players of ragby, who are on a global scale amongst outsiders.
The South African team will eventually go to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman's worked a few years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
I had no other purpose than to play this role to bring her closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing is that he wanted Mandela to shake his hand.
I found out that when I printed your hand, I was taking over your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt that I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon is in the film by Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national ragby team, in which they considered white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ragby.
The big surprise for him eventually was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened up to me, and the first thing that I told François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look so much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the apparent differences in actors' characters compared to their actual pre-departure led by director Eastwood, Invictus was awarded: Undefeated positive reviews and were also talking about the ambitions of Oscar.
The video critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his reviews to the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made movie."
In the film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus gained 76 percent of the positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway is dissolved: the Russians tested the rocket
Norway was able to observe the special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Department only admitted yesterday that the intercontinental ballistic missile was testing near the Norwegian border.
But the start was once again failed and the bullet called "Bulava", which was originally meant to be the fury of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black bridge of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence during rocket tests had no proper effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, the bulls didn't fly or get hurt in the air.
In the Russian newspaper, "Bulavo" is already written as "the ship that does not fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly, but it's light.
This one in order was already 13th attempt at the beginning of normal.
Until the end of the flight, there was again technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine blew up in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" began with the atomic submarine Dmitry Dońskiy, which sailed under the White Sea.
This type of rocket makes it possible to fire from a ship that is in motion at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unsolicited flying object was actually a broken "Bulava".
Besides, since the first time, Nora had no doubt about it being a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time and claim not to speak clearly of failure.
The first two levels of a rocket lasted and the accident hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines were broken immediately at the first level.
Even though there has not been one test start completely without error, the Ministry’s management of Defence is only six out of 13.
As a result, almost 50 percent success is filled with optimism and so still claims that "Bulava" will fly once without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hyperson nuclear blocks with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a contract at CSKA Moscow in 51 years
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again be present in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the Stanley Cup holder will assist in the distress of their CSKA Moscow team and will probably be in the KHL's Friday duel against St Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career in 40 years in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš got hurt, we really need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formal features, quote the AP coaches of the Moscow club Sergei Germany.
So far, it's not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can pick up the spirit of other players said German.
Fetisov thus, according to the AP, in the event of a return to the ice, will become the oldest Russian professional talker.
In the NHL he played in the 21st years for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and added 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful cutlery of history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven master titles of the world, triumphed on Canada Cup and Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he collected successes in the NHL, where he doubled over Stanley Cup in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai's been in line with the union, canceling all overtime.
The management of the Nyundai Nošovské autocar has agreed to cancel all overtime.
Because of the often ordered overtime, trade unions published a strike emergency on Monday.
It was confirmed by the driver-in-Chief Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, management wants to agree with the experts on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December with two shifts, said Vanek.
Server Seven.cz wrote that a company of employees who work on a Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
They'll get people back for Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company has decided to change its way of motivation for the proposed overtime.
They either have to pay for overtime or they can choose a spare night off December 28th, thus extending Christmas holidays by day, said Vanek.
In addition, all Saturday's employees get paid tickets and lunches.
Given the fact that overtime was the most violent and hottest point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists and protesters, as last week's production stopped, the management decided to immediately expire yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for December, Vanek said.
The car workers were forced to work out even daily after eight-hour shifts last week.
After the signing of the agreement, the strike emergency union shall withdraw
Further negotiations between car management and experts are to be held on Friday morning.
Petr Cook's union chief said on Wednesday, that if they agree to meet the requirements and make a joint document, they are prepared to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the carer grew up last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously jumped over constant overtime.
They also tested against bad pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management claimed that overtime had to be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for the vans of cars.
Experts also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who have interrupted production during the last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime trade unions after the company demand to ease overtime work at a minimum.
Moreover, they want to pay 5000 crowns for it this year.
Hyde's ski car now employs 2,000 people.
The serial production company started last November.
By this September she produced approximately 80,000 cars, her current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech Discover: a substance that also deals with 'used' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already acquired immunity drugs.
In some cases, this fact outweighs the fact that the compound does not make the virus as powerful as some of the medicines already available.
The AIDS disease has not yet been cured.
However, patients may greatly prolong the life of a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplying of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the development of resistent viruses against which drugs are no longer effective has resulted in incomplete suppression of the virus.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way with the resistance of the virus to deal with.
They have shown that substances called metacarborates act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metaloborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come up with new “better” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages formed by boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case a cobalt.
Obvious and durable virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV, protease due to HIV fission would not result in mature viral particles.
If we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, explain the scientists in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicine, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV agents has been tested in the trial and also against its resistant (resistent) variants of patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metalcarborans on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants which are often ineffective.
The only mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of further chemical modifications from metalcarborants makes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went to Fischer, he's defending himself.
Head of ODS Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year as "serious" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS statement was referred to by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's keeping time for analysis.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party no longer works.
The Prime Minister of the Government must decide, according to the Time, whether he intends to resist a minority in the House, which is a fight for a growing deficit, or to continue to serve as a parliamentary left-wing function.
The ODS access and social democracy to public deficits are diametrically different, highlighted Nečas.
The House in Wednesday adopted its 2010 budget, but with its left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased the money on the salaries of state servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The exception of government to social democracy proposals was that they secretly increase budget deficits.
The Czech Republic should handle CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so it satisfied the government's wishes that the amended budget is less wrong than the budget commission.
Disillusion and futility
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would even assess the current situation.
Time is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened by leaving the function in the event of amendments being adopted, the situation could look different.
According to Czech Television Janota, he ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after Monday.
He indicated that he was considering further maintenance in his function.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer talks for further fight with the deficit of the budget, they do not, according to Nečas, have, according to the Government, nominates of ČSSD, which have put changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will pass a demise if the House approves other laws of deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or the amendment of the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominee ODS
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated for ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the U.S. text message.
He recalled that at several departments there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
The time did not point out that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of fighting the growth of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he would be leaning on the left-wing majority that is at the moment in the House".
He said he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to do it, he told the journalists in the House of Defence Minister Martin Barták, who had just been nominated by the government as citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned
At the same time, it was noted that the ODS in the Chamber apparently voted against the amended budget on Wednesday unless the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats explicitly asked that the adoption of the budget be made possible.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, then he responded to the question of whether ODS did not burden the absence of the President in Parliament and the Czech Republic during political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be the Bolshevikization of the House and destruction of everything positive, he himself responded to Topolánek himself.
According to the new order of ČD, less trains will travel for almost the same fare
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less burdened speeds and locals, other connections will increase.
The overall transport range shall be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable in comparison with today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer tickets, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will receive more links to the capital city, including one set of peddolino tracks.
On the contrary, the fast train stops driving to Bratislava.
Less rychlíků will also be on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connection Prague - Letohrad will be reduced substantially.
From the regions, they plan the largest reduction of transport in the Královéhradecký Region, a total of eight percent, and the increase may be enjoyed by Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several speeds on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited only for some days a week.
The most important changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovics must be transferred to Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the city system Esko, its opening is possible due to completion of the electricity of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will be held at the destination station Prague Main Station.
The Czech Republic will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesenník in two-hour intervals.
Pendoline will no longer be brought to Bratislava from 13 December.
Regional Railway account: 200 million more
The speeds are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, a total of CZK 8 billion paid for the payment of the so-called proven losses next year will give the country less than CZK 4 billion, just like this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways and rails have a newly concluded 10-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The way the system praises itself, and therefore apparently did not increase the prices of the sterling majority of tickets.
The changes will take place only on day-to-day net rides ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be new from the distance, until now it has been uniform for a journey between any regional city and it has been 160 crowns.
Philippines's gunmen are still holding over 50 people, the children let loose
The armed officers today in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school students and their teachers.
It introduced the AFP agency, which originally informed only 65 people who were kidnapped.
All 17 children in custody were released after eight hours including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen say they're using hostages as a live shield when they run from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA) which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that requested the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared a state law.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, 30 journalists were involved with the elections to the Governing Office.
In order to suspect the participation of the massacre, the governor of this South Philadelphia province was arrested and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential family of Ampatuan.
There are also active Muslim separatists on Mindanao.
On Tuesday, though, they restored peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clinta Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Unharmed), which captures part of the life story of the former President of the South Africa Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-famous fighter against apartheid got worse by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for his film years ago.
The male leading roles of legendary South Africa champion in the rugby Francoise Pienaara have become worse at Matt Damon.
When the film comes into the cinema, both critics and the public rise from the message of criticisms.
Nelson Mandela
The entire name Nelson Rollahlaha Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 Sacharov received the prize for freedom of thought, and in 1993, along with the de Kerek Nobel Prize of Peace.
The President of the Republic of South Africa was between 1994 and 1999.
great expectations, because it comes to the public at a time when, however, preparations for the world championship in football are peaked in the South African Republic, while the media is also opening up disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the new JAR film is now positive, despite numerous reservations, to cover the main roles of Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood holli.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his new words.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and I've been preparing for it.
I've also met Nelson Mandela in person many times, so - as they say - drawing his energy, said in an interview after the Los Angeles film ceremony.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and the message in the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every man, he added.
On the National Rugby team's uniform
A book based by British writer John Carlin with freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that created the nation portraits South Africa's human rights advocate during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries to make two racers during the film and for many years of each other's defined population groups and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby court at the playground of the World Cup that JAR won at that time.
For entering a lawn in a dreary, which is in the JAR of almost as sacred, Mandela was disposing of a large ova of the Belarusian audience 14 years ago and gained recognition of the Belarusian population.
Football Championships may be able to reconnect people in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 on the national team.
Whether the pressure situation in the JAR improves, it'll only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical as to the example in a recent interview for LN revealed a fan of Rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Champion will begin on 11 June 2010.
On Lounsk fires the transformer for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was captured in the morning by the transformer of the company Čeps in a divorce place near the village of Vádkov in Lounsk.
At the fire, he interferes with six local spokesmen from Luke Marvan's mouth fire.
Originally firemen wanted to let the transformer burn out, later re-evaluate, and fire fire with a mixture of water, foam and special fires.
The cause was the technical failure, the internal shortcut of the transformer.
No one's been hurt, the crash according to Pavela Mandát's spokesperson doesn't threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, and it will be accurately numbered after the end of the fire.
The corruption transformer will have to replace the Mandatas with a new one.
In ten years' time, the activities of Čeps have not happened to anything like this, the faults of this type are unique, supplemented.
The supply of electricity according to CEZ spokesperson for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holingerová Hendrych has not been interrupted, the functioning of households, offices or companies of the trafostanica fire has not affected.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV electricity lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorcing with 67 transformers that convert electrical power from transmission to distribution system and route length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will report a criminal statement to three captains from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will now report a penalty for an excuse to three socio-democratic nahatmans.
And this is on Michal Hašek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardic Region and the captain of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in twenty minutes of the Radiocurnal.
The claim is related to the efforts of the company to operate regional train services in certain regions.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech drahams.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about our choice of roses, and we brought only what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we're left to defend ourselves.
It's for apologizing to Student Agency, said Radiožurnálu Jančura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares an initiative for the European Commission.
The Hasek of a Criminal Notice considers it another continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and my country, and to the same challenge as the other heroes.
I assume, even on this occasion, it is clear that it is Mr Jančura, who is manipulating the public in matters of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura has announced last week that he invests several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantages of the regions.
The radio-student said that the campaign will cancel after Christmas and continue after New Year.
He stated that the campaign would be held against corruption as such.
Kampaň started Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and to order about 150 billion crowns did not write tendres.
In the opinion of the European Court of Justice, Jančura states that similar proceedings are against law and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of the rail transport in the regions, Jančur, according to him, threatened also the Member for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave it, we could lose the bus license.
He showed up as Member of the ČSSD, I know which master he is talking about, I will not say his name, said Radiožural Jancura today.
Pneumococcal vaccinations will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals from January to the day of the day of the day.
He's supposed to be the first free family to be, at the same time, optional.
But the voices are already calling for a more effective vaccination obligation.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus peaks.
The medical institute has already set the maximum price for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in vaccination procedure.
New vaccinations
Free reactions for August children
From January, children born last August 2nd and later may be vaccinated free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't received one dose of vaccination yet.
Whoever started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay for his own extra vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, she left her children to fight the pneumococcus of a quarter of families.
Parents paid CZK 1600 for one dose and more.
Four doses are required when the youngest children are vaccinated.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue 300 to 450 thousand CZK per year for vaccination.
It will save them for treatment that children without vaccination need.
So far, the state has given about 500 thousand per year for all pedigree vaccinations.
The vaccination was introduced by a so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain wells and blood poisoning.
For pneumococcal infections in us a year, he will die from an investigation in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced depleted pneumococcal vaccinations of children against pneumococcos in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination might be compulsory in the future.
Since January it is due to be paid by insurance and non-binding insurance companies.
That it would be better for vaccination, for example, to indicate the head of the civil association Radio Rudolf Kalovský.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long been promoting.
Experts at the international conference that our associations participated were not entirely satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to do at least this.
I think that's the way we have to go now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcos.
At this point, we do not consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccinations have disadvantages, says doctors
Chairman of the Professional Society of Practice Children’s Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that he has a voluntary vaccination of his disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of vaccinations "For a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect their infants to have more than 80 percent of their fresh parents vaccinated against pneumococcus since next year.
The pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough, even if it is the first occipital vaccination of children by health insurance companies, not by the State.
Insurance companies should spend their money on prevention, saving their money for other treatments, explaining Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own substances
This includes concerns about practical paediatric doctors concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to buy insurance companies and doctors would receive them as much as the state provides them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies might "do money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait for insurance companies to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practical children’s doctors will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of an American artist, he stole from the museum.
The son of a reputable American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta was charged with an attempt to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frasetta was caught loading 90 images in his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains bagr region.
Mr Frasetta Senior, age 81, famous for the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time when it occurred, the artist was located in Florida, as the Press Press Agency said.
AP quoted the nameless police officer, who said that Mr Frazetta younger could be motivated to act by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police Mr Frazetta made a younger turnout statement, age 52, that he did so in the direction of his father, "to get into the museum in any way possible and to transfer images to the malting space," as the agency said.
Mr Frasetta refused to grant any such permission as the Agency said.
Labourers are opposed to the planned increase in taxes
Ministers defended the rise in taxes and cuts of expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "promenates" had the possibility to show that they really thought that they would postpone the decision to reduce the deficit for a period of time.
The Chancellor also got under fire because of low and medium income disability.
According to his proposal, it is mainly an increase of 0,5 % in social insurance and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments as from 2011.
Distinguishment on social security
The departments protested that low income workers were punished for a recession they did not charge and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is about 3 trillion pounds a year - which has undermined the community of entrepreneurs who have said it is an employment tax while it should be focused on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, which is limited to more than 20000 pounds per year, will be affected by approximately 10 million workers.
KEY PBR BODY
Social insurance shall be increased by more than 0,5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75 % this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers’ bonuses
Growth 1% of corporate taxes for write-offs in small companies
Reduction of taxes on electric and wind power plants
An increase in pensioning by 2.5 %
According to government estimates, some revenue will be reduced by £30000 per year and some revenue of £40000 will be reduced by GBP 190, whereas some revenue will be increased by £10,000.
Ministers announced that their target to reduce deficits by half by 2013 means 'stable decision-making' but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denied the proposed increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure being an ocean drop compared to what would have to be done.
"It's big numbers. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is an absolute essential requirement for the following four years," the BBC told.
Mr Timms said that he is convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up the forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In this opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75% - much worse than the 3.5% decline, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity.
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning of the "criminal indebtedness" of the Labourers, marked the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds in the next six years for incompetent..
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan as to how this could be settled, to add, "specifically", to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said the shadow secretary of finance Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after elections if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that money obtained by raising taxes and cutting expenditure should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce deficit, and they argue that the plans are "set in sand".
The BBC's political commentator Nick Robinson mentioned the timing of the communication - for example, inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the benefits in the next April - that this could lead to charges made by the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money would have been difficult to return a year later.
But the Labourians insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much, and the situation will be revised on September, 2010.
Suspected budget'
Even though the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it is clear that the reduction of public spending would only be the beginning of the medium-term restrictions.
The Institute of Budgetary Studies has informed that chancellor numbers suggest significant cuts in many areas, potentially included transport, higher education and defence in the Stock Exchange.
"It's really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All the important statements come after the elections if we win them," added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to the reviror account Deloitte.
"This was a report on the suspicious preliminary budget.
The FBI is conducting an investigation into American prisons in Pakistan.
The FBI is conducting investigations into a prison in Pakistan in five Americans, suspects of connection to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda, East Panjab, as the BBC of the American embassy in Pakistan told.
The FBI has informed us that this is an investigation into whether it is the same men who have been declared missing during the last month of their housing in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them say that they are originating from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others came from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were held there," said Ian Kelly spokesperson.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the agents were informed about the detention and were in touch with missing students' families.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their starting here and whether they really are missing students," she said.
Pakistani embassy in Washgington said that men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was always the centre of interest of the local police and that the charges against the men have not yet been raised.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillry Clinton refused to comment on arrest, she communicated the Reuters Press Agency, but stated that the United States had to "collaborate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in covering the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of Amnesty for Iranian misdemeanors.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as Amnesty International has reported.
The report describes in detail the "community of torture" in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened by rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials referred to this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran, and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmúd Ahmadinejadad, which led to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were taken into custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
According to the BBC’s letter in Tehran, John Leyne, now located in London, said that earlier in protests, the supreme leader Ayjatolah Alí Chomejny declared that some forms of torture were illegal and banning them in the repair equipment of Karizak.
But since then, almost no constitutional criticism has been tolerated, as our author said.
Untruthful confession.
Amnesty International quoted a report from a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology, Mr Methari, who said that he was accused of "ages with Facebook" and protests against the results of the elections.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in the statement.
"They were burning me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, and they threatened me with an execution, and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, President Mehdi Charroubi was defeated after the protests and was tortured to die in prison, and others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied rape charges, but admitted that torture was involved.
Amnesty also mentioned a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizaku prison.
Amnesty recognised that the Irish Parliament and the judicial authorities set up committees to investigate the electoral riots and reactions of the government, but stated that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were frozen.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park there was a ski slope
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the memory of Bristol in the slopes track tracker for the race.
The convention track for a race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill slopes, there was a short jumper bridge 100 metres ago.
A student of the fourth year of medicine, John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the slopes track, but that it was really culling.
It was a wonderful view of the flashy lights of the city down there.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboards from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the slopes.
After Thursday night's race, snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on mineral construction and generally reports on alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and thought whether Muslims can integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers have become an admirer of the author's last work, "Why the French do not like scarves on their head" (2006), this elegant and debated study on contentious issues which they have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose impact they are still under pressure today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the heart.
He has spent months in Mosques, Schools and Institutes, which are now looking after 5 and 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic Spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should Muslims enter the marriage union in the Mosque or the City Hall (or in both places)?
Should young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslims marry a man who is not Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the world-wide contentious issues that are discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than a political drama that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, not only Tarika Ramadan, Araba, Muslim explorer and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open up a debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of the French or European Islam.
The Philosophers and activists that Mr. Bowen conducted an interview are inclined to join the House that this is the anti-police of Selafi—consistors of the pures of Sunni Islam, associated with Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He asks how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which defends the lay public) are actually devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with the secular republic.
More than developing pragmatism, he discovered "throwing of value screws".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "Yes, but not now."
The most enjoyable prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bordering ice prevents alarming speeds, which affects the animals and their survival like anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers during their awakening.
In the book "On the thin ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrationist, features the natural history of the North icon, a polar bear.
A long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who only fought with a collage of muskets is a real myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who were swimming behind the bodies of their precisely killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 75 polar bears in one circus tent.
Even today the gardens in the zoo have a typical area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the low hairs of its coat.
After clicking here, you will find more!
Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters are threatening to survive species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting from helicopters and Indians on the skis, and they are all armed with powerful firearms that shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book, Alun Anderson, former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and unscrupulous responsibility for the Arctic science and a long-standing view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen's research journeys at the end of 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century indicated for the first time how the floating ice takes place.
The cold-war submarines then plotted the moving overflows when they submerged them.
Satellite surveys and large-scale probes in floating refrigerators are a useful addition, but many still take place thanks to the unthreatening individuals camping in the winter.
Mr Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the salvation system inside the Arctic ice, created by a streaming of saltwater, which freezes during freezing.
But from this bear's outcry to microscopic miracles, it's all doomed to fail as soon as summer ice moves, which happens sometimes between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it could be us.
6,000 Marine Corpsers put a prisoner on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple wreath on a soldier's grave, never met.
For him and the other marine men who made the trip from the Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National cemetery in Arlington, it was the day they gave tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect for the way I am trying to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put a wreath on a cemetery veteran in several departments during a pietary act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, opened this tradition when he and several others decided to make a few hundred graves while the penthouse act in Arlington.
It is now 18 years old, when Mr. nMorilla and his wife have taken this journey every year and stops in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters don't seek profit in this, the prisons across America, which are also found in other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 prisoners in Arlington Cemetery, on the territory of the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park, New York City, and on the memorial site of flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's Foundation has been working on more than $15,000 for the purchase and transport of prisoners.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, the deceased armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that it was her way of returning what the sacrifice was.
It's a little way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers of the cemetery passed through the surrounding lawns and hills in the warm fabric.
The volunteers headed for older graves from World War II and Vietnam because these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and together held their hands when they transported the young pine to the wet tombstones.
Every round wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the top part.
Near the 60 section, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained truly silent.
The combined organization of services devoted 1000 prisoners to the decoration of the department, but the cloudy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some were truly crying, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some of them read names out loud, carved into stones, while others bowed down to view small black and white names, pushed into a wet mud where the tombstones have not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who used to wipe tears from their son's grave.
She went eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of a soldier's motor gunman David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we were single... my son paid for it, she said.
"Although I was long gone, I want to be the one to remember him."
American government contractor trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government arrested the U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, as officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, has worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consultary officials, along with the American Interest Section in Havana, sought access to a detention facility that was imprisoned on 5 December.
Some accusations have not been published, but according to Cuban law, Cuban citizens or foreigners may be imprisoned for almost anything called "hazardous".
Any so-called counter-revolutionary activity, including mild protests and critical states, raises the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but the permit was denied.
The arrest of the US supplier can be a consequence of the growing tension between the Communist Castro's brother, ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was followed as "maintaining tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report on New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners, and will create more space for the opposition, the associated states will take action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-out commodities in a country where average salary of a state employee costs $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used after sending text messages because 15-minute phone calls would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government connections such as universities.
The Cubans, who often want to log in, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Arresting an American in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba's prison are behind bars for tedious acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press office Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Prisoners and arrests were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which in every other open society would be legal - let's call it free mobile phones - are a criminal act in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, the director of the US Human Rights Programme, who recently published an adverse report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, same Cuba," as a conversion to the installation of Raula Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the rude older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all the solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as these two countries are heading for a wider dialogue.
Pakistan’s government officials spread the conspiracy regarding the transmission of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday exposed the alleged leader of the conspiracy regarding the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said they hoped that this case could help cover a vast network of terrorists who are slurping on the Internet looking for a radicalized young man.
The investigators said that they were looking for a gray insurgent personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment, approving terrorism attacks has an online video pages YouTube.
Saifillah took charge of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the native tribes of Pakistan, home to al-Qaida and its camps for training terrorists.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who filed the case report said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in testifying to the commanders of al-Qaida and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the east quarter of Sarghody, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
That's why they were planted, said an official who spoke about the maintenance of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain approval for access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, American intelligence has assigned the highest priority to attempts to put human resources into al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization work as watchmen, extorting those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who could be witnesses.
The American false recruits were subjected to a special examination at al-Qaida.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group because, given their potential access to the American objectives and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more careful in recent years in this period, the cocoon will allow them to join them, because American intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, is there no better way to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed?
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanded climate action.
Tens of protesters marched across the streets this Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from those in the Bell City Congress Center.
The protestors have shown a number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are insisting that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges close to a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when a minor event occurred in the climate talks that were sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who said "The Land"
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographers Helena Christensen, who said she was traveling to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information on the distasteful state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's part of why we decided to join this great march -- walk through the world and appeal to world leaders to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to do it, it can't still be avoided.
The police prevented protesters from getting close to the center of Bell and said she held 19 people, in the first place because they either had masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one of the unparticipated audiences, who did not want to be identified because they are involved in climate corner corners, activists masked as athletes and in black suits put several loads of near Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministry offices.
They were in buildings, he said, started with lights, but then followed "some large explosions."
Inside the congress center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But protests are likely not affected by the knowledge of key officials such as Su Weie, the Chief Climate Negotiator of China.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is actually something I do not realize).
Then he continued Chinese and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on out."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
It is seen the focus of the general public and of the various sectors and subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a breach of the negotiations or the freedom of others.
The test date revealed the constant persistent race differences
The federal certificate from last week on knowledge from mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding public education district Columbia.
Although the district is far behind high-performance systems of the country, the certificate has shown greater progress in pupils of fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National Testing Centre for Progress in Teaching are the persistent differences in the achievements of knowledge between African Americans and white students both on local and national.
The average result of white pupils of the fourth classes of the Columbia district has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but their African-American peers grew by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in the oboia group children has improved during this period, the difference has hardly been closer to 58.
During the last week, some of the defenders of education have expressed their views that the results, celebrated by mystery Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more stimulated in white students where they had already been high.
That would indicate that we have increased the sum of the support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, an ineligible group that defends the equality of the division of division.
I don't jump up and down because of the distraction of two or three points, a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown Committee (D-At Large) who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton High School.
Often critical of Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown stated that the test results report means secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the hammers and I respect that.
But what's scary is that we didn't have nearly any time and energy that was needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs Rhee said that the effort of the district was to continue to find better ways to focus on the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in using new osnovs, Wilson’s reading system, focused on students of higher grade primary schools and secondary school students who have failed to handle the basis of reading earlier in their collage career, are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and education of mathematics into the sixth grade, emphasising games and real life experience, which came to the district for the former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the progress of NAEP, which was submitted last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and do the best possible intervention for those students who remain under the class, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others stated that NAEP’s results explained whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and continue to provide more money and means for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain winning dilem of Mrs Michell Rheeová, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the California University of Berkeley where she studies results in urban areas.
The conventional procedure for the recovery is to target the means and administrative reforms of schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can bring political experiences that are facing an important agenda.
But the extract also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the average dimension between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of major schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to be given excellent public teaching.
Mr Janey, now director of Newark School, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to take place in the right of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his schooling association last year for 185 days, which he considers to be a "sign" to search for a greater increase in the next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The bus drove into Gettysburg railway with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, went out and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gratilini's parents have hardly graduated from high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the ground of the railroad.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group studied Gettysburg, where the training was $38690 a year, their position was rather than scaring visitors with enthusiasm for potential students.
Yes, it is! She called Gracie who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, it was thoughtfully, when the professors had a low ratio with students.
The Pennsylvania railway was one of the seven who visited their three-day tour and were now completely intrigued by future news: The question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is where.
However, this is a serious problem regarding the number of born children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from higher education or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who get their college education and thus enter high school.
In fact, the 5th of this "long generation" of Spanish students from the dormitory - remarkable results show that many of their immigrants' parents, mostly Mexicans, and Central American citizens, came to the United States without finishing their college.
Their success story is important, they tell researchers because it undermines their point of journey forward for the generation, which played a marginal role in the country's labour force field.
Those who have reached higher education say that they had a natural tendon to school and a natural perpetuality and effort to succeed.
Many parents also had high goals for their children, looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to attend railways - especially if they survive these efforts in time.
If we can see that children are moved from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them orient themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network of all ways to get them to go through college.
The Federal Programme, which financed Graciely's tour by rails, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to launch railway programmes that start for students from small high school income groups and continue until these students complete their high school.
Since 1999, the programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraq’s oil industry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to bring significant oil companies to reconstruct their inhuman infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iranian Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the recovery of the Iraqi oil industry, surrounded by decades of wars and sanctions.
The American companies left with equity participation at just two of the 10 out-of-wolved fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction that started Friday.
Only one presented the lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on a field that was hit in June.
The participation of American oil giants in the open Russian oil industry has been surprised by analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the Asian road and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online intelligence.
It'll be a long time before there's anything else in Iraq for sale.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday's and political instability, as well as downloading the US military, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has a proven third largest raw material reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were in a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more willing to take risks because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConococcPhillips, maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil industry minister and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts which were awarded at the end of this week.
The state National Petroleum Corp. participated in more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts to two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic force, as well as technological force, said the spokesperson of the oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable with competition and will fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies which were provisionally selected for submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price for barrels and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
A spy planner al-Qaida was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the impact of an American rocket at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, he was apparently killed by a top-level Operation Planner al-Qaida, as announced on Friday by officials of the U.S. counterterrorism department.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets arrived on a Thursday on their car near Miran Sah in the province of Sevverní Vazirisstan, according to American resources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have reported that missiles have been fired from an aeroplane without a type crew operating the CIA in a range of illegal native tribes.
They were put on a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency called from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local gunmen got to the point and seized quickly what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victim, but two American anti-terrorist officers quoted an unspecialized witness who said that Somalia was dead.
Somalia was listed as a highly built-up military operation planner of al-Qaida, who was running an operation of terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in reenergizing throughout the world, said a senior official who didn't want to be appointed, who imposed a sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he had such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top management of Al-Qaida and planned possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another American official said that Somalia was moving rapidly in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a commonly known person for some Americans, but he didn't have to humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-rise leader of al-Qaida or Taliban who should be killed from September when NUmudin Jalolov was killed, the leader of the militant faction in the band of native tribes and three other top post-pertional leaders.
The rate of attacks initiated by CIA using unmanned aircraft has declined since the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the records of the Long War daily, the website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also killing those who suspected they were informants, said the site.
The United Nations Senior Delegate in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations High Representative in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to withdraw from his office in March and end up with a turbulent term of office, which was wasted by charges against extensive corruption in the election of President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure occurs because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US's timetable for reducing the state that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, said Eide in the telephone interview from Kabul.
A long-term commitment must be accepted.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping to turn Afghanistan political.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he wasn't going to resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise that he made his family in March 2008, that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look around the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between leaving my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations officials, Ban began looking for a replacement.
Officials said that it was between Staffan di Mistura, who had a Swedish- Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, French, who had conducted the UN peace operation before that.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzam, who won the presidential elections from masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but stated that the charges of Galgraith -- which was released -- "indeedly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" during the election.
Eide said that he proposed a meeting with the High Representative of the citizens to coordinate the suspension of efforts to lead the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also instructed the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries that would lend them to the Afghan mission, so, as he says, he wants to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN's difficult hiring regulations undermine its ability to exploit.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces other sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that he will soon place "other important sanctions" on Iran because of the lack of commitment in interviews about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in Northern Iraq during a week's trip to areas where they war in Afghanistan and Iraq, bagovatovat the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question of likely development.
One of the things that depend on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is unthinkable invincible invincible in the war.
Obama’s administration is decided on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also be affected by ordinary Iran.
He said that "a bag of incentives and arms" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will extremely suffer" sanctions.
According to the fifth opinion issued by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration involved the European Leader in the warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop his expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks at Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about the limitation of his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgent fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration was based on such an agreement as a way for the creation of confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations.
However, since then, it seems that Iran departs from the provisional agreements - partly because of the fact that the Irish leadership is divided into views on whether to engage in the United States.
To be honest, as far as Irish stubbornness is concerned with the international community in the case of certain proposals which he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to reply to proposals before returning to finding other elections, including monitoring, which the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrade sanctions".
In its opinion issued in New York City, Iran’s UN mission condemned on Thursday what she called 'unfounded and unfounded charges' to some members of the Security Committee on Iran’s nuclear activities and stated that she wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers 'to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Iranian Prime Minister Nouri al-Malika before leaving to the area of Kurtan, rich in oil to meet the troops in Kirkuk and the Kurds in Irbil.
It continues to have high tensions between the Kurds and Iraq, mostly due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the detaining of US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen the Kurds' concern for persistent depression. The U.S. Official Place quoted Gates when he communicated Massoudu Barzaim, President of the Kurdist Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In ageing China, exchange rate
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One child also means one grave extra".
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai alarmed by low birth rates and aging population in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and determined: Never.
We've always spent all our time and energy on just one child.
We haven't kept anything for each other, says Wang, 31, human resources manager, who has a eight-month son.
For more than 30 years China’s ongoing policy has been introduced only one child has created and thus created two generations only by the noorically boublest and strangulated children, and by the very name "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The mean birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per pair compared to six, but the policy was in force, based on UN data.
Distribution of the population, where the population at the age of 60 and the higher is predicted to grow by 16.7 percent in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater rich coastal cities with a population of higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people at the age of 60 and over formed almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered residents, while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "to help reduce the proportion of ageing population and reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's about being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Progressive calming
As it was inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably until now the most controversial mandate introduced by the government of the Communist Party.
The doubles that violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and discrimination at work.
The Chinese official sites promoted a policy that helped the country to prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned to promote politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to submit to abortions during the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to have sexually selected abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials were gradually milder in their opinion on the politics of one child.
In 2004 they usually allowed exceptions - including inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles -- and in 2007 they eased their handsomeness, promoting hard lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research of the Peking University, said that central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight were posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailed descriptions of how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
City administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and to put flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, said the family planning officers.
Irresistible Response
Even though officials in one rural town near Shanghai recorded an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most of the city districts did not report changes.
Huinan city district with 115000 populations, for example, has still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of born in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee, said that the financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn't want to have more children.
They want to give the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she liked two children and was legally allowed to do so.
But as many Chinese, who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without the network, it could be irresponsible to choose.
People in the West judge the politics of one child badly as a contentious legal question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant during the seventh month of age in union with the first child.
Yes, we were willing to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples describe the psychological reasons for weighting.
Wang, human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention of our families and we were all caring for us.
We were not used to provide care, and in fact, we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who expressed this much indiscriminately.
For two-card parents from the middle class who reduced birth, he said to be successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30-year-olds view their parents as the first days of a Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, she says.
There's just one child laying enormous requirements for parents' time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are some questionable questions of propsor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a resumption ready at a time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle down with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has set up a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisputed attitudes and inter-contribution -- has again focused on the release of a document that proposes ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, with most burdens in the near future.
The text that can provide an exit to the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it was seen important progress in the negotiations that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by ad hoc UN working group, this text states inconveniently how much money the rich countries should provide to those poor for dealing with global warming for the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and control emerging economies, so that carbon output can be reduced and what the upper limit should be to rise global temperature, which political agents will still be able to tolerate.
John Coequyt, Prime Minister of the Washington Sierra Club, gives the process a large dose of flexibility.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, wrote from 180 pages the text from the meeting on what top of the UN climate officer Yvo de Boer described as "a great picture".
It sets out an outline for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent over this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
On Friday, the European Union made a promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poor countries adopt adaptations to climate change – from the handling of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
But he still mentioned Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed during the talks last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Matters Todd Stern rejected the speech requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to the voluntary among the main emerging economies, unless they are financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that Obama administration had established a tougher line against China to be Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the execution of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei communicated to the US's main contractor about climate issues that either lack of sense or "excessive irresponsibleness" had led earlier in the week to the announcement that the United States would not financially help China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world’s major powers in bets, the Taganics both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly about maintaining individual economies rather than maintaining the planet, between China and the United States, as regards the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that two dozens of the most influential countries in the world ignore scientific imperatives for carrying out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become far more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsible in their actions.
It is a clear game of the fact that the new economic hegemonium is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as regional advisers in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they would want to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, has created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of small island nations "has called out a political clash in the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demand actions from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations brought about new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining disputed questions before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environmental Protection Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Deputy Minister, came out of aircraft and ran the halls of the center of Bella to the closed door of the meeting and new conferences, so they could lay out claims that will be assessed next week.
The vastness of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved every day from and to the congress center, to guitars playing activists staged at night an irony looking at the countries they thought had sent them, and there was more to hand-to-hand proposals than an electronic mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier at the center of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Nature Protection.
They're coming heavy weights.
The British first train with a speed of 140 miles an hour provided for this Monday felt
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, he cut the darkness at the sign of leaving the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and flies from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras and runs a distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal kit outside of lLndýn.
He hopes that the new service will possibly connect Britain to the international network of fast, reliable trains and will connect the major agglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Occupied water should reduce traffic times in passenger transport and on business routes and transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate traffic jams on roads.
In theory, three major political parties were allowed to gain for this vision.
But dozens of liberal bilins, needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disturbance, have now brought about building British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a realistic study to the government, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times said.
She gave him a detailed map of the route of the next planned high-speed network stage.
A new route of London and Western Midland was designed within five metres of urban areas and districts where it could be problematic to reach the environment.
In the open landscape was planned up to 25 m final route.
HS2 also envisages determining three choices for a large-scale high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is the definition of letter Y, when one high-speed line should lead to western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that there has been a most powerful choice," said the President of the Railways.
As soon as it's done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than once in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive at 2250 miles an hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to take trains of 400 m length that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the line London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 2 000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, the existing station is expected to expand so as to understand the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will notify whether or not to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before general choices.
Even if it leads wheels to motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing runs north of Birmingham and retain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a critical point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on the railways.
Tax taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75000 for Tory oranges
Alan Duncan, the holders of the front seat bench Tory in the Chamber of Deputies paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
The spokesperson for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members lived "from rations", increased their mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a dubbly entangled expansion in their second house in Rutland.
He was able to charge a special interest, hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The current authorities have approved claims in time, and so they have not been questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who has carried out checks on the Member States' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan has declared his demands "it has been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two floor houses on the village in his constituency, Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There's a kitchen on the ground floor, a living room and a dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
He added a winter garden to the house last year, which is marked as "orangeria".
The neighbors describe it as "the glass for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan has not been asked to provide some explanations for an increased loan during the last check of the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed his petition security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £800 per month.
The interest of RBS in Mr Duncan's mortgage could not change at this time, indicating that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS of mortgages decreased from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, which remained in December 2007.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after one of the secret reporters filmed him and said that the Members must survive the "at ration" after the expenditure scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on a ration and treat you like a s**t."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
Member, a millionaire from his former career as a oil trader, was first invited to explain his edition in May when it showed that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before approval by the financial authority, that "can be considered excessive".
One of the activists kicked the pit in the form of the lybra mark in Mr. Duncan's lawn at protest after it revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When he was asked about an increase in the mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved both by the financial office and subsequently by Legge."
He added: "This is not a question of hiding and clapping or breaking the rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, right, and that's all.
This would not be easier or cleaner by many other means".
Come all carefully to see the cottage on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Coast cottages in Brighton have found a new sense of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encouraged the custodial exploitation of creativity invited 24 owners to make their cottages decorated for every day in December, and to use Christmas colleges as a topic of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when the visitors allowed to see the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishoply bread and cooked wine, free of charge.
The chosen colleagues included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the hut represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant to television marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chicago Diocézi and head of Beyonda.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post - Christian society.
"Why should we expect as a church that people will come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
"Idea advent calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobility in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
On Saturday, thousands of people went to the streets with the demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should have been adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrationed around the world and Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police resources, and a hundred thousand according to the organizers, manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, aimed at adopting an agreement on Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference stated that the growing global mobilisation, which is clearly evidence of current manifestations, has contributed to the fact that the 'political tax' of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, there was an incident in the Danish capital shortly after the opening of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black, started to break down the tiles with tiles and hammers.
The law enforcement immediately hit.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and made it clear that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which were already shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Koalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without difference" and pointed out that about a hundred of them were in ties and in the session "maintained in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went in peace towards Bella Center, where negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
A podium was built for speakers before a spiritual encounter during candles in the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from large European cities and, besides Africans, there was also a large number of Asian participants, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, which was called on by the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "blue waves" for a "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explaining to Lida Nacpilová, the Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say any more: it's time for this, the Benenian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry up, today we can walk in them, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
The French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and fighting for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Turkey region, where many islands are located particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people came out of the street.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothing, and with scarves that evangelize the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada several hundreds of demonstrators came to the streets with a requirement for a strong measure against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatistic Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia condemns it as "frust"
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step as "frašku".
About 131000 people were invited to take part in these first elections after the Russian-Grussian War in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17 hour GMT.
According to the Afghan Election Commission, a few hours before the closing of the election rooms was 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Sunday night from Saturday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergey Bagapš, are categorically rejecting the idea of a merger with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
These choices are French.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "sorry that Abkhazia fell completely into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgalaga.
In addition to Russia, they recognised the independence of this territory with only 216.000 inhabitants of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia that was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After a conflict in 1992-1993, after a few thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through the election that she is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the phases of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the letter AFP Kvarchia Světlanová, 54 years old historian, who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote in the election room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, into a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian rule is the main topic of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
All over this small country with 216.000 inhabitants are deployed huge billboards with Bagapš next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to watch the sharp run of elections were warmly accepted by the district mayor Beslan Aršba.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful," said he in a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow, and in particular its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexa Ostrovskii, a member of the Russian Parliament and drank glass vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbou and two traders Zaus Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control Abkhazia's railway network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says she doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
Most 50% plus one vote is necessary to win elections.
If none of the candidates achieve this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
On Saturday, thousands of people went to the streets with the demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen Conference, demonstrations around the world and Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police resources, and a hundred thousand according to the organizers, manifested in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18, delegates from 193 countries, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went in peace towards Bella Center, where negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
A podium was built for speakers before a spiritual encounter during candles in the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, the incident occurred shortly after the departure of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers began to break the window.
The law enforcement immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifesters hit the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and made it clear that these were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that had already been shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Late this afternoon, a single cop was injured with a firearm and four cars were lit near the squat near the incident that had been held for the result according to police resources for about 20 people.
We're focusing on an extremist group, warning the spokesmen of the police Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters went out again.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the call of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "blue waves" for a "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explaining to Lida Nacpilová, the Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has called on several known personalities such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson to talk to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Turkey region, where many islands are located particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people came out of the street.
In Manile, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing, and with scarlets that evocative the importance of solar energy, were manifested in front of the city of Philippine.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta several hundreds of demonstrators have also been met with the requirement of strong measures against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
The objects of the landscaping and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of general gymnastics, Chatel said.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during the interview for the journal JDD that objects history and legislation will be "strengthened" in the context of the reform of general gymnastics, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of gymnastics with focus on exact science.
Now all students will have the second year four hours a week and for all will also be the same program from general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end up with hypocrisy" because he believes that S specialization is no longer focused on ecstatic science" but "the students are basically the best in it".
The specialization of the EC and L cannot be for some kind of sub-specificization, continues and emphasises: "I didn't have many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional gymnastics, they don't learn how to write and history."
On Saturday, Ifop’s survey, which published the Humanité daily, showed that seven French out of 10 (69%) disagree with the government’s project to cancel the mandatory lessons of history and landscape in the graduation year, as well as many intellectuals and teachers criticised this abolition as well as some Members of the Right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not taken into account" to cancel philosophy in the program of specialization of the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teaching education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which according to them offered the teaching education of future professors of gymnastics.
As part of Master’s Study 2 (M2) will undergo an initial admission test aimed at their field and at the end of the year another course verifying their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
He will participate in the vocational stables during the second year of Master's studies and they will appear before the pupils as a professor-sister.
If you add all the internships that will be offered to you before taking the procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, nearly 300 hours, continued .
The Minister has also announced that he will propose a "personal right to education" which does not exist in national education so far.
He again confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At École University, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes for the performance of the Copenhagen Summit’s objectives: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel in the Council in the morning, the multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts for Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one journalist AFP informed, Jean Jouzel's Nobel Peace Prize laureate opened the first of the 'Ernest' conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of 15-minute contributions from experts, who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would want to learn more, explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which received a name according to fish from a local pond named students.
There are about twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines, and he explained that the selection was based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without any advance notes prepared, only with graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, stressing the hope that the audience will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very well-prepared scientific foundations".
The videos recorded on these lectures will be placed on the school's website from December 15th.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned for February and the next will follow the rules every two months.
Payment delay: anger among prison overseers, planned measures
The prison overseers department announced on Friday 'general mobilisation' because they demand that premium and overtime be paid to them in Christmas holidays, whose payment was paid on January for financial reasons.
Inmate FO (2nd Departments of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations held on Tuesday morning before prison facilities, and to "block" and so to point to "theft of their wages".
CGT for prison overseers (3rd trade unions of this sector) has called for "to call for meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilisation" with the fact that it is "obsolidable and unacceptable" to "times and allowances for work at night, Sundays and holidays" processed in October, not be paid in December.
First Departments of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "he calls for overall mobilisation... in order to demonstrate dissatisfaction and bitterness."
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a message to prison overseers, which ensures that the payment will be made next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes to the Minister in his message.
I ordered the Board of Directors of the Prison to take immediate measures so that the situation resulting from the poor evaluation of the number of overtimes has never repeated in the future has been supplied by Minister Alliot-Mari.
The prosenc wage will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous premium for performing the functions and achievement of the objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "the budget always finds a place".
It's just a scandal, the interregional union of FO in Marseille, and announced its decision to boycott into the appeal of "all meetings and appeals".
Workers won't come to work on Sundays or holidays if they pay these days from October, as well as overtime, they also threaten to FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvregne.
At a time when they give us more and more work and tasks without giving us other staff, it is sad to allow the lowest employee position to pay for that, CGT-Women overseers in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case the funds were little, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama claims she gives "better gifts" to Christmas than the ones she gets
The American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, was entrusted with the "bohyni" screen Oprah Winfrey, that with regard to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The President and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious housing.
Even Bo, a little four-legged family partner gets his cut.
Jesus loves Boa, too, said Michelle Obama with the fact that the dog also "self" gets a gift, as it results from the pre-stakes of the show.
And Michelle Obama was also remunerated against the claims of her husband on the quality of gifts he gets: "No, I definitely didn't, I gave you great gifts last year," she said to the president.
Well, of course, that's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately with humor he showed his finger to the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show, with a famous moderator, who actively supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the husbands of Obama also talked about their unbelievable gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a wheel with a ten-step transmission, but also a basketball ball that dedicated to him at Christmas his father, who had only rarely met him.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, telling the president.
Until after that, I realized that the ball actually gave me him.
The first lady again remembered the doll house.
I didn't know how to organize it all in my house and so I settled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, and I reminded Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday's re-operated, RTL says he's in his sleep again.
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of the "marriage" arising from the greater operation he had done in France, but the situation is according to his closest "inspection" while the RTL station said that the singer was in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night from Wednesdays to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors marked "marriage resulting from the operation" of the warm fence, which he had done in Paris on November 26, told his press department in Paris, with the need for "correctional operation".
However, the singer’s press department tried to calm the public down and said that the situation is "controlled" and it also announced that a new medical communication will be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into a artificial sleep to prevent "bolests and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little greater certainty, he'll deliver an RTL.
The press department, on a request from AFP, did not even comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to some sources, no training was placed after the first surgery in Paris.
Rocker was operating at the Parc Monaco International Clinic for a warm fence.
The surgery that has been planned several days in advance has been performed by neurosurge Stephan Delajoux, a doctor who is well-known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After this surgery, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the hit.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on the radio, that his friend was just going through a "bad time", but he added that he was not worried about rocker 'cause he's a big "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid, because spending 12 hours on the plane after that operation there's no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said Johnny Hallyday, " reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "contained".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laethicia, the wife of the singer, and that he did not notice any particular concerns.
A healthy singer’s problems have only been multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on "the small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66" which is presented as his bachelorette.
But since then, all his health problems have been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has been struggling to move on stage.
In the middle of November, his team had to comment again on the new hospitalisation report.
Euro-2009/small pool: prime minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the big pool, received a title on Thursday at the European Championship 2009 in a small swimming pool in Istanbul, which he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which combinations are last allowed, only three world record fell, although many more were expected.
One of them crossed the Hungarian plant Evelyn Verrasztová to 200 metres of the semi-precious race and two remaining male stubs of Russia to a 4x50 m position race.
The great grief for Bousquet, who made a world record of 50 meters free of charge, which is already the holder of a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines swimming, 50m free way, he won a 28-year-old French with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final final, on which ten swimmers started on top of the regular eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rusa Sergeje Fesikova (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30) as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers had suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combination helped from February 2008 to 238 World Records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, a two-time world master in a large pool in the summer of Rome, which had a world record to reach their hands.
Young swimmer failed to overcome a record that holds at 400 meters free of charge (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew this time I wouldn't get over the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: the record of the Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zola was issued in USD 1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than the French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned out for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is much more than it was estimated, said the art dealer Sothebys.
The price of this two-meter long and 63 cm tall frontal plates, originating in the third century of our flight, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dinésian scenes in a elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satirs and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces in the world is very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday, Florent Heintz, Vice-President auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
Sales are still in progress, but it is an object that was applied to most of the time, told AFP spokesman Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernette.
That Emile Zola had taken this marble a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in a famous collection of Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated with it in her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynauda, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the operation of Marshal Petain.
She's been stuck there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered in searching the museum database in Louvre that this record was part of the "others of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and French "Rougon-Macquart".
A busy attempt to leave President Zelayi from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the top President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who refused to provide a safe exit guarantee, are not met.
After a phone call I had with President Zelay last night, everything suggests that there is no way to make this transport, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived on Wednesday to Salvador for President Zelay, flew back, provided the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Government of Pussy wanted to force President Zelay to "demise" and only to ask for political asylum abroad to give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the President of the United States rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of the state of exile.
The government of puscists "have experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my function..., they wanted me to pass a demisi," said Zelaya Radio Globe on Thursday, in which she often expresses itself as a political crisis, which has lasted for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, he's delivered a high president hidden in the Brazilian embassy at Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played a few accords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, said the Minister of Interior of the Puckian Government, Oscar Raul Matute of the Hondura radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station, which has its registered office in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Dutch people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelay's departure mobilized on Wednesday, the rebel president, who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs Celso Amori, criticised the position of the Puckian government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the socialist Venezuelian President Hugo Chávez on 28 June, took place in preparation for his re-elected public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on 21st September and found refuge in Brazil's embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested and he'll be responsible for the crime of "intelligence" that he's charged with, says the Puckish Government.
On 29 November, President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections, recognised by the United States, but condemned countries of Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.

Index Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, it's done because the market is focused on half full of glass.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on American trade balance numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter."
The US trade balance deficit dropped by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
On the contrary, the analysts expected a rise in the deficit.
Imports and exports have been increased.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economy of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment has increased against all expectations and the number of job applicants has reached number 474.000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "at the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has dropped too.
The proceeds of the Treasury with a view to 10 years have increased to 3,48.2% compared 3,423% on Tuesday night and the return to 30 years has increased to 4,49.2% compared to 4,408% of the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime are singing "Damas in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime were written on Thursday by the wife of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented other manifestations that were arrested by dozens of dissidents.
About 40 "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were turned off directly on the street supporters of Raul Castro’s regime in their march towards the capital city centre, with a requirement to release political prisoners, informed the journalist.
Out with the Yankees!, "Solds!", "The streets belong to the revolutionarys!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" they bow down to the uplifted fists of the regime to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by members of the civilians who came to "security".
A day before that, there was a similar manifestation of "The Lady in White" in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, some ten dissidents were detained, who were also going to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day, informed the journalist AFP.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who were dissidents of government regime in civil vehicles using force.
Disciplining dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours to rule.
Sakharov Prize holders of the European Parliament for 2005, "Damas in White" organized an unauthorized march for "freedom of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", stated one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda has been serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 still remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponent to be "solds" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
Finished wonder, Cuban TV brought a report on the quarterly manifestation of government advocates' regime against the 'resistors of revolution'.
Cuba with the Communist Party in the head and politics of the Government of one side is regularly accused of European or American NGOs from non-respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
He killed an eighty-year-old man with a knife and hurt five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
The madman armed two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and hurt five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the top on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker, at the age of 28, allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons, a man in a pharmacy or in front of him, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man born in 1929 died according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband began to defend himself at the age of 30 and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an eight - year - old man died.
The life of the second injured is at risk, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "at shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was probably under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, possibly by chance: a thirty-year-old and 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How it all happened is not entirely clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butchers' knives carrying a cross behind his back, said in the place of Head of the Alliance Syndicate at Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, tried to stop and disarm themselves, according to the testimony collected by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three youngsters were trying to catch him.
They failed to do it because he was pretty strong, commented on Alberto's situation, a waiter from a nearby bar.
The crowd, including one city police officer who broke his wrists, has added it.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, with two city police officers, including their commander, tried to hold a armed man while being wounded by the fists, said a police source.
There was an incident in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
My peers came to tell me there's a wounded person out there.
I went out and I saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed the great wounds on the belly, told AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second one came about thirty-year-old, who also had stabbed wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have ID on him, and then the state police arrested him.
The D.A. at Nanterre handed over the case to the investigating department of Regional Police at Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police didn't rule out his location at the psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to handle him at the Clicha police station where he was taken.
He was "tall apart" like "all the madmen of this kind whose power is increasing in action tenfold."
US: Polansky's lawyer is asking to end the criminal prosecution
The Polish-French director Roman Polanski once again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the west of the United States) to halt criminal prosecution against his client, currently in his Swiss residence due to an moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "Pianist" criticized three judges of the second period in California with serious errors in court trial at the time of the event in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now, and now, the lawyer Hummel said, and he added that from the behavior of the judge who decided at the time on the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "had been freezing in his back."
According to him, he had a judge (who died between him) who was supposed to act with a state attorney who told him Roman Polanski deserves to go to prison – which is a serious violation against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and requested), from the mouth of the state's attorney, David Wells.
But at the end of September, Mr Wells declared that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will be required to make a mandate in which he may submit evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was said in the first state, namely that there will be no serious examination of an application for the suspension of criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought to court.
76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978, before the court brought judgment on the case of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor girl at the age of 13.
He has never entered the United States since then again.
The Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "to be there to participate in trial."
We would like to refer not only to Romana Polaski but also to other defendants that it is possible to flee? Mrs. Asayam asks.
It is the opinion that the director "requires a favor from a court of law and despises his authority at the same time."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
Legal Hummel wasn't alone who requested that Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution be stopped.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also once again asked for the end of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case came out and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland under U.S. order
After more than two months of jails he was released into his house prison in Gstaad, waiting for any execution.
Wall Street ends with no direction, holding him a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is dropped between indicators that are better than expected and rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It stays in close range, the volume of trade has decreased very much, and I think it will remain this way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, which "which helped improve the mood on the market in terms of stability in economic recovery" summed up the analyst of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November and that has already been a month apart and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers also returned and increased strongly to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
Indexes, however, were sounded by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stock is so losing land under the feet.
The securities market dropped.
The export of treasures with a view to 10 years was increased to 3.540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday night and increased to 4,497% as compared to 4,492% a day earlier.
Miss World's election again in South Africa.
After a month travel across South Africa, 112 candidates for Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This great beauty celebration has been held for the second year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, and for the time being, five candidates have received a procedure for semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone has been entrusted.
The competition held in South Africa after nine will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 o'clock (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to put my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, and Miss Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was held in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "land that comes out of breath".
After months of performances, trials, meeting with the press and safari now Miss is focused on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopraová hopes to go in steps of Priyanky Chopra, elected in 2000, which also participated in Aishwarye Raiová, the winners of 1994, which both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will appear in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The presentation will be performed by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former queen of the beauty of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World Committee of Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is difficult to welcome the world of warmness, which is difficult to deal with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who had taken their hand.
For the president, she noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Without a doubt the most beautiful memory will remain drawing in Cape Town (the southwestern country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could've met people I haven't dreamed of.
I'm sure I'll be back at the 2010 World Cup, saying with the enthusiasm of Miss Italy Alice Tatachi.
According to David's son, Hallyday's reports are "very positive."
Johnny Hallyday's reports are "very positive" as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport inLos Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
It is very strong and it is going very well, said David Hallyday when he took off a plane that flew from Paris for a while after 13 o'clock local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who worked peacefully, declared that he would "go to losangele hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was accepted on Monday for post-op infection following an operation of the warm inter-rotation fence, which he entered in Paris on 26 November.
According to the press release, the singer this night in Los Angeles, due to the comfort of "insected into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and ease treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was introduced to a sleep in Los Angeles by doctors of Cedars-Sinaï. Hospitalization occurred due to infection following surgery of a warm inter-robular fence made in Paris on November 26.
Because of the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer must have been re-operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the information provided by photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of French lycea in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
The forefront of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumaology of the hospital la Pité-Salpêtrire, Yves Catonie, announced that she will fly to the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer accused Dr. Stéphana Delajux, a neurochiruga, who was a singer at Clinique internationale du parc Monacou in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, said M. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday has gone too fast to Los Angeles with permission of his Paris surgeon."
Personally, I spoke to a doctor on the phone and he assured me that this journey was no problem, which surprised me very much, because I had already suffered twice the winning of an inter-Robilla fence, added.
A while before, the radio station RTL said that the singer apparently flew away after a Paris operation without a drone, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in art circles.
He operated Maria Trintigant's actress in Vilnius a few days before she died at the clinic in Neully-sur-Seine, which he was working on at that time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg had also operated as an actress when hematoma was removed due to bleeding in the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, many times condemned in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner called him "man without scrimp," who is "normally" being called before a medical chamber, and which can not be "revised".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke to the matter by means of his lawyer David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had a "excellent course" and post-op exam was "normal".
The operation was not a hemorrhagic character, and therefore it was not necessary to introduce a drone," he added.
The health problems of the singer have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with a question mark.
It is obvious that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens, see red.) appears to be too close, said Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls on the parties to Nouveau Centre not to continue using their shortcut.
The UDF group, controlled by the MoDFrançoise Bayer, responded on Friday to an attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina to take account of the shortcuts of the former Giscard party, with the fact that the shortcut must not be used in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF shortcut with the fact that François Bayra does not deserve to bear her inheritance after he handed his hand on the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UPP, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by the Members of Hervé de Charetta (a former member of the UMP now in favour of the NC), which credits the ownership of the UFF since he first registered it in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrelle).
But on Friday night, the UDF Congregation Committee, controlled by a friend of François Bayrou, who did not intend to own up, came out of his silence and submitted a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using a shortcut and to return the ownership of a trade mark under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised a worrying statement about proposing your political movement + knowledge to take over the UDF+ shorthand, writes the Association in your letter signed by 19 those 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnaz by the MD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance Centrale.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional material and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, are also written by signatory letters.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UFF Committee, which requests an NC movement, will immediately remove all notes of the UDF's name from all promotional materials including (your) websites".
At the same time he asks Herwe de Charette to transfer ownership of a trademark to legitimate owners.
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts in order to respect the law and legitimate rights of the members of the UFF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, UDFs "is a full political movement of 1978 "and they remind Mr. Morin and his friends "they allowed " leaving in 2007 to create a competitive movement, just like others in 2002, to set up an UPM.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore has no right to use UDF shortcut (Union pour la démocatie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to set up a committee entrusted to defend "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Committee goes on, "When he registered a trademark", he was not "is not already a member of UDF for three years", but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This indifference begins to transform itself into a crime, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: "We seem to have a more valuable name for ourselves in a normal life than to come out of anonymity by accepting the names we have no right to."
Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried to abuse the state of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to rule out whether he used the state of weakness of eighty-year-old millionaires to prepare her for part of her fortune, of which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which a penalty is imposed for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that there will actually be a process in the bail that can be referred to as one of the richest families in France, in which mothers are attacked with their daughter and are fighting for the management of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
Of course, 15. Court of Justice also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliany Bettencourt, which should carry out a college of three doctors.
Grandpa and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undertake such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the state council in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time submit a statement whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he's going to make it.
I'm going to talk to her about the matter, say, after the end of the hearing, Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
As regards lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court decision.
It is an excellent report(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It's two years since the only daughter of Liliany Bettencourt started her criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer, and all-timer who was guilty of using the state of weakness of her mother for years to get billion euros in the form of checks, contracts for life insurance or pictures of masters.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be the photographer she considers a long-term friend to be manipulated.
While the court had to assess the jurisdiction of the prosecution given to Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the fifth court case of lawyers changed at times in the family hour of truth.
Lilyany Bettencourt's lawyer filed three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent her notebook and expressed her distrust against the husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds, "You could explain to my daughter that I had written Banier for 15 years once a day.
I've never been able to talk to François ever since she got married."
In Nanterre, the state representative again found that the complainant’s actions were not justified, even more that the guardian judge rejected its application to initiate the procedure for legal protection for her mother these days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely capable of participating in court, not even under the protection of custody.
No one else will act for it", confirmed the representative of the D.A., Marie-Christine Daubigney.
In the end, the Court held that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would express themselves at the time of the start of the trial.
Manager's Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, it has been a reminder of the behaviour of large companies in relation to employees of companies’ access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is the case for the co-workers to identify themselves with "values" designed from the mountain, as it was earlier when it had to be forced on consumers products that were derived from ideas of factory technology.
By comparing the marketing revolution strategy of the market in the right direction...even when authoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, are returning regularly!
A passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that ranges mainly from managers.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And, indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders... an active approach and ability to predict" and requires employees with commitments which are completely contrary to the authoritarian management's income.
That is why we are calling on a management revolution to put workers in the centre of interest of the company as well as a client.
Relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that the structure after different turnings will come back first to what she's always done!
Furthermore, since authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of universities for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their mental comfort, they adopt an old behavioral theory, currently re-invigorated by "neutrals" from the United States, and widely spread without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and media.
With the possibility of moving "sics" (sic) involvement of managers, Ipsos’ recent survey on Figaro.fr’s website, which only confirms managers in their position of mechanical management, which is inappropriate for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating the basic position into all intentions and practices : For employees, commitments against the company will be possible only if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of worker motivation only deals with studies Motivally functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of pre-defined dox, which will enable them to, through a picture that tells them about the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, managers can control, predict and anticipitate on their "social performance" and place their management of human resources on the right path.
This creates a living land for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
By showing from Oslo, Obama earned praise from the right hand.
On Friday, the American Right handed welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize holder in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who at first laughed at the award of Obama on 9 October, this time the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, former Vice Presidential candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, declared Palin, the bridge of the right-wing republican wing, for the USA Today journal, and added that she herself expressed itself on this topic "sometimes necessary" of the war in her memories that are just coming out.
The war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to have for work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bushov, during Thursday in Oslo, justified his power-deployment and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a very good job in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really good, congratulations by former President of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be quite historical, declared Gingrich during the interview on the radio series "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see the "Leader's President" to remind the members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price at peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "big American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as he always did, but he said "the American president" and reminded Europeans " that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they do not do too much to keep it," he evaluated Gerson.
A few dissatisfactions from among the right are the Hawks of Bush's era, former ambassador to UN John Bolton, who referred to the speech as "a single, inflated and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, such as the democratic representative of Dennis Kucinich, is appalled by the view of Barack Obama as he justifys the use of power.
"When the war is packed in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press is facing the President with a commendable view.
Although Los Angeles Times still considers the award of the Peace Prize to Obama as premature, he assessed his performance as "excellent" even for a speaker known to his talent.
Projek of Oslo should serve as a guide to international resolutions in conflict management, in fighting poverty and relief, but the California daily is intimidation.
Obama "said a speech as needed", evaluated the New York Times, and called the speech "for simple and informative".
Road transporters: three Marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three years of marathons, road transport and TLF, the only employers' organization left until the end, the Friday night of the agreement that ended the challenge to strike and the threat that was hanging over the supply of Christmas supplies.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, in Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "rejoice" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as quickly as possible by the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned.
But there was a need for more than six hours of a meeting, which began at 11 o'clock to all agree, and at 18 o'clock, to sign the agreement.
This conflict "that would hurt businesses very much" and "may threaten to break the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text includes an increase in wages by 4% on lowest wages (for local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (national transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wage is increased from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we give our members orders to avoid blockages, no blocks of supply centers.
But there may be some other opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grilllot, President of TLF, welcomed "the right deal", even though it was hard to admit a high salary increase due to the international competition ".
According to him, it will increase by 170 euros per month at the lowest wages and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a agreement of sanity and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT) this is a "precedentable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focus on the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "reduction by EUR 100 million on corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of an amendment to the 2009 draft budget law, which was voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night at Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "suitable" vote.
The signature enables this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later to the whole branch, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
The event "in the shortest term", provided by Bussereau.
The whole process can only be disapproved by employers' organisations.
FNTR is talking about "bad trade" as EUR 100 million "which was offered to the sector as part of the compensation for carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to emergency action not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to ignite the fiery turkeys at the time of Christmas holidays, she complained of Unostra.
Otre's organization threatens that the agreement in the next 12 months "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises".
RER A municipal trains: travel interruptions on weekends, unions not satisfied with the proposals of RATP transport company.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A line of suburban trains, which is the largest public transport line in France, will also continue during the weekend, because the Friday negotiations between trade unions and the RATP led to no specific results on the issue of premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will ride only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (limits La Défence and Nation) will ride every other train, apart from this section only one train of four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Sales houses Gallerys Lafayette, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP tried to ensure connection with large business houses".
Linka RER A leads from the west to the east of Paris' agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train was in operation from two and virtually no set was driving away from the top as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France did not deal differently and there was no confusion on the platform.
So early this morning, at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) there were a lot less people than usual, among other things, because they were missing pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up by "hour and half early to be sure that he would arrive in time".
Saint-Lazare’s road was not overflowed, notified the state railway SNCF, for he foretold a large number of people and guards of order.
RER A passenger trains operated by SNCF in a direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrive or depart from Saint-Lazare Station with a connection to the subway.
Another general meeting of strikers will take place on Saturday and Sundays, which will evaluate the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management which the unions evaluated as "weak".
RER management proposes negotiations on a specific protocol for RER A urban trains on all pages, adjustment of working time, career course, etc.
However, that is not the case for drivers who demand a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP even put forward proposals for the premium for now, which worsened CGT with the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem while it was possible for travellers and SNCF to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the profession are reviewed", RATP specified the transport companies.
Which is why experts think the business "is making fun of weekend travelers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers took over a business committee in his office in Paris.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of the "ceasing" in the interests of the meeting.
It is dangerous that the conflict will expand on Tuesday, even on the RER B line, after Unsa and Independent alerts the strike emergency.
The departments demand premium from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendants (non-depends)) and make the working conditions worse on this line which transport millions of passengers daily.
RER urban train drivers make €2200 to €2700 gross wages in advance and €600 to € 650 premium for irregular working time and for working on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party and this decision has difficult consequences.
On Friday, the Constitutional Court decided to cancel the main Pro-Kurd party in the country. This decision immediately brought about protests in the Kurd Community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can considerably complicate the task of the government, which is trying to hand the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party for the democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it became "the nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its Sundayly unity," said the press president of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 Judges, when, in order to dissolution the party, most of the votes were required, Kiliç said and added that 37 party castes, including President Ahmet Türk and Member of Aysela Tugluka, were prohibited from taking part in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglucová used and the seizure of the assets of the party by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP side has 21 chairs in Parliament (from 500).
It has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdulahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Working Party of Turkey (PKK), which Ankar and many countries consider as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political vibration of the rebels of PKK.
The Party assures that there is no "basic connection with PKK", but refuses to refer it to as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's Verdict comes at a time when the government gives a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and try to reduce the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end the conflict.
DTP’s leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to the restoration of tension in the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been rejected against the conditions for which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcana is detained to clash with the police.
From the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the DTP residence in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, mostly the Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators were throwing Molotov cocktails or shooting stones from washing machines.
Also, in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After taking the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice was "a deepening desperation".
Turkey cannot address this question (Kurds, see red.) by prohibiting the party, stated in the press.
The Government, which was formed aside from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're the principle of counter-interruption.
It doesn't mean anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented on the political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can look forward to reacting from PKK, adding.
On Thursday, PKK applied to one of the most murderous attacks in the north of Turkey, who killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
No, because he wants to bully citizens, he says the head of the winter Technical Service Department of FES.
But so his employees can try and learn to control all the car technology.
This could happen for the first time on weekend by meteorologists.
There are over 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is progressing according to the exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt whole and temperatures fall below zero, they go out to 20 so-called sections and a big guy, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit moves such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firemen, urban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, a damp salt that is better held within a maximum of three hours is necessary.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock at night, "that roads are free until transport to work."
It's hard to keep snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to do a sleeper's place."
Only when it doesn't snow so much, there are incoming and connecting communication, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At 5:00 in the morning, FES men will go on the road, clean up dangerous places and transitions first.
The FES is usually unable to take care of all the cyclists.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 above all the bridges, says Brauburger.
Since they are quickly formed iceberg, the sleepers will leave as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaure column
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal long two metres and 1.50 metres high was running on two strong rear limbs, had a arched skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with rough claws and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then found in the equator's dry area of Pangea's supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for an earlier dinosaur evolution, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relative relationships, enlargements and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt started and other paleontologists with excavations in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found dozens of dinosaur bones on one day, it's uninhabited for trias settlements, informs a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists fast as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Found confirms the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual finding: "Fosile dinosaurs from trias are very rare, usually only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about early dinosaur history, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of the pradinosaurs is mostly disputed.
Experts are discussing, for example, when they are divided into three most important development lines: teropod carnivores, which later belonged to the Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and birds as well as the birds, four-legged sauropods, and their relatives, and the herbivores of Ornithichi (the bird) which included, for example, the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced features, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of airbags, which also had offspring of birds of terror.
As a result of the airtight, the breath of birds is more effective than mammals.
The bones of the spine were clearly filled with air at Tawa hallae.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terror with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lines of huge sauropods had later also airbags and light bones, they created this useful innovation already in common forefathers of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because, so far, the most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists developed that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time as the supercontinent Pangea formed a uniform ground mass.
She would also speak to the fact that the team found the remains of two others together with Tawa hallae, not particularly closely related terrors.
These three can't come from one common immigration ancestor, arguing with scientists.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One other older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonese paleontologist Martin Sander.
His thought could form a deformed picture, because in South America many very primitive fossils of dinosaurs have been preserved, and the other continents rarely have been preserved.
How did dinosaurs prove that, from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles, they have evolved to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the times of the Earth’s Middle Ages, they still remain a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the trias, dinosaurs have spread to the world and many new species have developed, while relatives have died and interfaces of trias and jury.
The success stories never lasted forever.
There are two hypothesiss to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extermination that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not a plague.
Or dinosaurs got better adapted, so they could squeeze out the competition.
The history of success did not last in any way forever.
One hundred and fifty million years later, the impact of meteorite on another animal group, which has also evolved in trias and lived in shadow since then: the mammals.
From Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatories are international.
The list includes professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley, California.
They joined the donors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brno.
Police clearance of the occupied French University casino took care of the worldwide start.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America share protesting students on Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English "do not approve" the presidium stimulated by police intervention.
Because they were enchanted walls and works of art, the university president of Werner Müller-Estler left the building to be cleared, which they took over last week by strike students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, the signatory judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and police officers".
Deployment represents an "unapplicable intervention" to freedom of research and science.
Excessive focus on vandalism is used for "inadvertentness and criminalisation of protest" and draws attention from content.
The presidencies have avoided the need for discussion.
Speakers call for the suspension of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Proclaimed protest
Students from Verdi and the German trade union also solidarity with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Earth's mystery youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far been defending the procedure of the Universal President and the Police.
We are grateful to the university president.
The destruction and castment are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Actuelle Stunde (Actual Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land House.
We have an understanding for protests, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said to the MP of the Earth for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition faction of the SPD, the Greens, and the Links.
The CDU takes the painted wall behind the excuse to criticise the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, the elimination has taken place.
Linke has submitted a proposal that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
Long summer, it paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Greenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Center, is considered the Russian Silicon Valley.
Major micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located.
Since September 2008, the Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the French Scientific Centre Riedberg - with the University institutions and companies of Frankfurt’s Investment Center (FIZ).
Many mutual visits were made, and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelerograd and Ridberg, "The Protocol for Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow morestar Jurij Rosljak and the prefect from Zerodograd Anatolyj Smirnov, for Frankfurt signed the Head of Planning Conference Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will take part in natural research into the seminar to Zerodograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also an economic relationship.
FAZ will be allowed to stand firm in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Greenograd is based on important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the Great Company Sitronics and Rossisskaj Electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as the so-called 'social planning city' for military research.
Zerodograd (a literal translation of "Green Town") gained its name according to the wooded hilly landscapes in which research facilities are established.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuart 21 is not enough to prepare.
For the supporters of the project, it is quite simply the "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than starting a station, more than a monstrosity building that will throw the capital of Bádenska-Württemberska into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Sutton 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway station, which ended in the center of the city, was then regarded as a transport-technical fossil of the 19th century, which acts as brakes of modern rail transport, because there was a need for enormously much time to move the locomotive from behind.
Let's go, let's stop, let's go, so it should work.
Therefore, head station: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Sutton: the railway station, which lies in the middle of the trans-European railway magistraly between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of 'European hearts'.
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that the start of construction was almost unfunded in Hesen and Bavarian city.
Since there are modern pendulum trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main station has no longer been in trouble with jamming and driving.
Still: It starts with a Stuart 21 including the new line IE to Ulmu.
The country and communal politicians established it.
The routes cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state company.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some other way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe in computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful to the railway transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which is typically in the 1980s - a huge increase.
That's when there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must go first of all about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight transport on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of a sharp climb.
More serious is that S21 is indirectly touching many other railway projects.
In Švábsk, a good six billion euros were to be buried.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It's clear that in the next decade, the funds will be missing for the next node points and narrow places in the network.
There are 60 larger projects on the list of transport departments.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been at a slow pace on this route.
There's gonna be a lot of pressure to push.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route to the Rhine valley will become the pride of the bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left the Land of Wiesbaden to the Earth if it will go against the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) judgment on the ban on night flights and will allow it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP Coalition commissioned experts to legally judge more than 400 pages of VGH’s judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the State would have to adapt the night ban on flights planned in the case of the construction of the North-Western Ranve of Francfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 years between 23th and 5th hour, as the Government of the Earth assumes, does not correspond with the law imposed by the protection of the population against the night of air noise.
Coalitions must be decided by 4 January if they will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and led to a representative of the government in order to dissuade the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel faction called on CDU and FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights that it has given before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as "infraction of the word".
It's fucking hard, if you can keep your word, said the Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the bump on the FDP electoral slogan "We're holding the word."
Minister Posch has refused the execution of Schäfer-Gümbel, the country's government is working through "interrupting rights and tricks" to get to its flights of night.
The exact legal control needs time.
Coalice doesn't want to work on "quick first impression."
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His claims to the ban on night flights were never the case of the opposition.
American banks paying for help
American, big banks' crises are getting rid of state bonds.
The Bank of America paid out at the same time on Wednesday to help the bank rescue fund Tarp amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros).
According to the US CNBC report, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
In this way, the Constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have been taken by taking money - to limit the payment of bonuses to managers and to pay high fees.
The bank of America took $19 billion of net money with investors due to a changeable bond.
The rest of the money was taken from its register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trades.
The bank chief Kenneth Lewis, specifically thanked the U.S. taxable person on Wednesday night: The money injection helped us overcome the difficult time.
The monetary institution damaged itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup also wants to free himself from its obligations towards the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC reported with its reference to its source that this US bank could have announced already on Thursday a capital increase of about $20 billion.
The spokesperson of Citigroup did not want to comment on this.
In June, aid was paid by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Selection
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after the Management Board of the ZDF pushed the director Nikolause Brender out of the office.
Last night, the gremium wanted to agree to the person in question.
Peter Frey, head of ZDF Studies in the capital city of Berlin, was a favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially not to run the process.
However, the role could also have been that they did not want to harm the ZDF’s intensity of Markus Schächter if this proposal were not passed by the Management Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the game.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he crashed in the Management Board of Schächter with his proposal to extend to Nikolaus Brender the contract for another five years.
Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although she could have been expected.
The EU’s majority in the Management Board has signaled for several weeks before the election that she does not want to confirm Brender at the office.
Resistance to the editors organized the Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the office of a highly-weighted editor, arguing that Brender's monitoring quotas for ZDF's intelligence broadcast have fallen behind him.
Until a short time before the election, protests were therefore strongly criticised by the political influence on the ZDF.
The last time in the debate, there were even 35 state-owned lawyers who value Koch's procedure as reputable.
It wasn't useless.
Information about person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 passed Frey to ZDF, first into "heute-Journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 lead and moderator "Morgenmagazines"; to 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; from then on leading ZDF major studio.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the Media Magazine Journal of the Year, was established, announced by Zelena that they would bring a constitutional action.
Koch's anti-candidacyate in the Management Board, Rynsko-falsky Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal countries should change the contract with the ZDF so that personnel's proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, took the board with a smart chess move - immediately after Brender was set up, critically criticised for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalist's independence, he could no longer be nominated as chief editor for his face without losing both Schächter, so he could be elected by the Governing Board without the suspicion that the party would be pushed into office.
In the party’s arithmetic, Frey is equally assigned to the left-wing liberals.
The studio's getting rid of the harpampas
Particulate success for students: After a year of stopping, they finally took over the Minister of Culture on Thursday to the Federal Countries of Culture: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that it was the will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load by testing: In principle, each study module should be completed once a single test.
In addition, the working burden of students should be reviewed and a "real and defenceable peace" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for the bachelor and master’s study fields.
Earth’s deviations should cease to exist.
Less of the tests
Since the start of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and the university rectors in their mouth have had word of better study.
Now they are filled with a particular content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board has fallen down that the number of tests in part will be reduced drastically: "Every module will normally only be completed by one test", writes in a 30-page report, which is to be partly newly regulated by the approval of study fields.
"Excellently lower test loads", said the chairman of the Reinhold Grimm accreditation board, "the incorrect development that significantly reduced the difficulty of studies."
This is supposed to be a 'seriousness of studies' in the future 'deciding criteria' for implementation.
Modules and content need to be controlled hard, so that "no limits the students during the selection"
seminars".
Students should "sight on a space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply in the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also for the current fields of study.
You need to be "credited" every five years – but that means that it will continue until 2015, before all study fields will be reviewed.
The 10 accreditation agencies, which are responsible throughout Germany, are subject to accreditation boards established by the Federal Countries.
In October, the Ministry of Culture called for "sightly" federal countries to act on agencies so that the equipment was not too big and the test regime is not strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed to the Ministry of Earth on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far promised the Porin-Falcko additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Schools should mainly cover consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen test and foreign offices.
The countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on it.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring amendment to the Parliament of the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one single test should be required to complete the study module.
The production of studies should be even more flexible, so recognition of tests from other universities should be guaranteed and the master's availability is to be made available.
By the end of next year, the importance of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition re-evaluated on Thursday about study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, the criticism of the resolution has also fallen.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Group Juso has called for education policy to not play in the future 'on closed door' to ministers and university rectors.
No later than a strike, "at least a word should speak to it" students such as the persons concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need student experience" on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which HRK advised on the joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW) there was not enough scope for the Bonska resolution: They demand legal claim to each graduate with the bachelor's title to allow access to the construction master's studies.
Secondly, the federal countries must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelor's students, there are plenty tomorrow available in master's studies with the best study conditions, a member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller said.
The Federal countries must employ far more speakers.
However, the Ministry of Culture did not comment on free access to master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one poem poem by Werner Söllner, who, in this embossed language course, discusses the experience of attracting one dissident who gained freedom, has also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a speaker of a children's book label, then moved to Frankfurt on Mohan.
Söllner was awarded various literary prices, 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary French Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesen Forum of literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, on Tuesday, he took care of a large non-terrorism seminar in Munich, on which it was a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a broken mirror of its security records".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which, in front of fellow writers of Romanian Germans, Richard Wagner, William Totík, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, he admits to his cooperation as a secret informant for the Romanian Secret Service of Securite.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received a language prize in 1989.
The attempts to recruit are said to have started at a low level, first in 1971.
I went on to Söllner, "That's when someone didn't resist enough attempts to intimidate themselves from the Secretite."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent of Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize of Hertě Müller and its irresistible literary settlement with the Dictatorial Government mechanisms is a literary scene, and especially a community of German authors originating in Romania, shattered by a case that marks the depths and shames of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it is possible to say according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
In the files of Secretary Walter played a secret role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to him as a positive influence on Walter's secret agent.
"He cut off" me in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and before this publication unexpected, but it is not entirely surprising to admit the former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Muller wrote in July when she read her own file, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the top Secretite.
Subsidiary, you can assume, will speculate, and in some cases even know which name is hidden behind the cover of the name Sorin, Voic, and right now also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, in the meantime a very certain examination of the components of Stazi is the manipulation with the remains of the Securite control yet very dissipated.
Over the past few years, systematic lighting of the lubricant has been reduced and reduced.
One of the Birthday Offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of the components of the Securite (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the release of the act has taken place more long.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the components.
That the former Secretite members in Romania still had a great influence after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Muller, one interview in which one of the former Secretite chiefs of Temešvár expressed their views on the holder of the award refused.
He said my psychosis, after all, was only questioned once.
The indignation of power has been expressed completely uninhabited in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the context of silenced accusations, raises inevitable questions.
Why until now? Who has been damaged? A strange response by listeners to Söllner's confessions makes it possible to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine a desire for knowledge rather than after the admission of guilt and shame.
It's more than a footnote to Herty Muller's geniuses that received Nobel's award yesterday.
Loaded Champions League Deposit
It seemed like a clean-dressed business representative from a cute Christmas party where he was handing out the manufacturer of sports goods of sweetness when he entered a quarter an hour after midnight in the invited Mercedes class C, a new coach of VfB Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-coloured sponsor.
A man with a brandy tinker was allowed to drive a foreign town after him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in play, and drunk luck was also a 55-year-old man.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow's gonna be going on at work.
Or it's just about to start.
Words are only three days’ engagement with Swiss: "We have achieved eight finals", thanks to the winnings of:1 over Unire Urzice from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by success: It will be brutally hard fighting the retreat."
"More important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Máchi performance from royal class even on ordinary league days.
And to prevent reassuring weaknesses after three rapid goals of Maricy (5), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawout
The eight-final Champions League (judgment 16/17. + February 23/24/Return 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babylon’s horrific successor will therefore remain preserved.
Not only with the alleged healer, who provided uncertain stuttgart professionals during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to set up and enjoy the game.
I went to the players, and I told them to focus on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be braver, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not show any effect for the effects of therapist Babbel.
"When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after many weeks of break due to the injury, became the best player on the field because of his dynamics, tried to describe the recorded "fenomerine" by the word "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "It is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Apparently it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But vfB Sutton needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before it came an ugly awakening after the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedir.
And the sports leader Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal was reached in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after the first home victory after three months, due to the weekend events that were freshly experienced in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions other than Jens, he's taken by Heldt to hard Lehmann's criticism.
He presupposed the board of directors of weak leadership and decided to change coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even since he was canceled his free day after the matches, Lehmann referred to as a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism", aired Heldt and announced the consecration for goalkeepers.
I don't think both 40s will have any joy in their lives anymore.
Anyway, they're for one thing with the others, that without the work of the appointed coaching team, it wouldn't be possible to play such a strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Battle of the World Cup in Hard Weight
Stunning duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the Master of the World Vitali Klik.
However, after twelve hard wheels, Ukraine has defended its title in the heavy weights of the WBC boxer organization.
The judgment of the judges was unanimity.
Hamburg - Vitali Kličko remains the world champion in the boxing weight.
The 38-year-old champion of the WBC beat Kevin Johnson on Saturday at Bern in a one-off at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It is the third successful defense of the title after its return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukraine was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't go to the... that they all expected.
The click has improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he was defeated because of the injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
About 17,000 viewers in the Berlin arena drove 2.02 meters high The fighting section mainly with their left.
Eleven inches smaller Johnson, who before the duel announced the end of the Klicky era, but pulled himself off before the strokes of the Master of the world, so Klicko couldn't set a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In total, passive Johnson did a lot on the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next round.
Although the click provoked words and gestures, its strikes, its masters of the world have hit little.
But even so, it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klick for 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of himself before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He's insulting the Clinic as a "resistible zombie" that doesn't know anything right.
During his Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled Johnson out of his nose's sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klick Return
Even after the fourth battle after its return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin, Nigeria, and took back the WBC belt he had had to commit without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight, I only got one punch, and physically I was in good shape, justified the Klick of a quick return to the ring.
His dream remains a defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA is wearing the British David Haye, after he settled from the throne in November 2,13 metres high Nikolay Vulaje.
Haye left a fight against Klick in the summer, scheduled for September.
He's supposed to be a promoter of his fight against Klick in London's Wembley Stadium.
Case of Kundúz
Front attack from the opposition: Chief of Green Jürgen Trittin marked for bad information about the affair of the Kundúz Minister of Defence Guttenberg as a liar.
SPD and Linkede (Levice) are invited by the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlín - According to the latest findings of the attack on Kundúz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodore zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious deception.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two Cisterens in September said, "knowly false," said the boss of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's news series "Tagasschau".
Let's call it the usual expression:
The order for killing was issued in non-respect of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of NATO's report, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not just about the destruction of stolen trucks, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
In the U.S. air raid required by the German commander Colonel Klein's Kundúz, there was a murder or injury of up to 142 people according to NATO's investigation.
Greens, SPD and Links called on Colonel Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately express themselves before the Federal Snow and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Chamber - and, if the Office of Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Renate Künest.
The spokesperson of Ulrich Wilhelm has definitely refused criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also a loud doubt about the ministry's term against the background of the release of Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg informed the two of the right and completely about the background of the attack on the tank.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister's sensitive details.
However, it was noted from the area of both top officials that they warned the D.O.D. even of several reports, between them on the two-page documentary commanding Colonel Klein and one military police report.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert was to ask in the letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received an answer yet.
The Ministry did not comment on the speeches on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the investigating committee of the Federal Chamber, which would be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in the pale state and hear voices that don't see and hear others.
Not only mentally ill or drug connection are the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie down with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
However, those who are living in the blindness of the night, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, usually pay in the Western world for foolishness or drug addicts, or at least as weird.
However, such images and voices do not exist only in the mentally ill or in the drug connection.
Vinu has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, here and there will make sure that the boundaries between dreams, visions, and reality go away.
Dreams of altered consciousness can occur in various forms, in better case we call them vision, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, you can see Hildegard von Bingen's mystics, the New Age experience of Carlos Castada, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis, and hallucination stem from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain occurs - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylquine - and interactions between different parts of the brain are broken.
Complex hallucinations and foolish thoughts occur very often in schizophren psychosis.
Gravitation doesn't have much over him.
The connection between the blue and the dream employed philosophers and physicians from the antiques.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a pale state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, recorded in 1861 "a great similarity to misappropriation with dream states", for Sigmund Freud was a dream even of "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and crystal color.
Gravity over him has no power, rising to the ceiling of the room.
Smells like a kick.
It's behind it by round black characters with bloody red grumas, precious teeth.
Drives him, digs him with heavy fire shoes, throws him against the wall, feels pain on the whole body.
Loud, bad voices threaten the wall and the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that they give him and insult him.
Henning T. rips out two cables from the stereo, sinks them into the loop and heats it on the hook on the ceiling.
He's gonna stand on one speaker, and the loop is hanging around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, scream the congregation voices, tear out his drums, "Go to the clinic and let him heal!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
LSD's been launched.
His diagnosis is schizofactive paranoid psychosis, besides it is manic depressive, taking medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's three years married.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt in my psychosis, he says.
Miracles are terrible facts
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics, it's the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disabled are mostly unable to distinguish the inner and outer world, they are becoming a reinventory condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or illusions of persecution.
The hearing of voices is particularly extended - the voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
No optical hallucinations are unusual.
The disabled is unable to distinguish important from the unessential, the brain cannot filter out the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the buildings of flooding thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head doctor Klinika general psychiatrist at the University of Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of the event, everything is important to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overkilled by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not usually possible, the miracles are terrible, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, she says Fuchss, "but the sense and spatial structure of the reality that one sees in psychosis, is substantially preserved."
Deteriorating experiences and hallucinations are based on reality.
The scientist is still in front of a puzzle, why exactly our brain does this kind of thing.
Exceptional conditions can lead to short-term loss of relation to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal brain damage.
In the early stages of development, we believe that neuronal brain damage, such as mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, is explained by Finchs.
But he remains a puzzle as to how the neural system is broken, which has not shown itself in the course of this long years.
Roles also play the influences of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences may be an initiator of psychosis if there is a history of mentality.
Hallucinogenic drugs may also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain warms
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicine, others give money for drugs to get it, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we see delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
The Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years about hallucinations and hypotenuse; last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Real World in our head).
Hallucination is a typical accompanying phenomenon of psychosis, but also a surprise of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as border personalities or depression, also often diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions and the brain of a healthy person himself.
Hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain is warmed up or if it lacks stimulation.
Drugs may run this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also to remove stimuli, stress, fear of love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the students were asked to experience hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 has been living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Urbansk, and she goes to that gymnasium.
Actually, it's a totally normal girl.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
Breaks may happen to her address cologne with long dark hair.
When he responds to him, she's been looked at by surprise classmates - no one can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl thinks of a tense dream, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, he hears and sees this boy, just like he hears and sees a girl sitting next to himself in a bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes that boy.
I'm crazy, he's ever asked.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather rousing.
There are often delusions of burden.
When he sits in a class, he can’t watch teaching, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else clearly and visibly on the mathematical equation table.
In the night, the images are rather rousing.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes little and too late, she can not often distinguish whether she's awake or whether she's asleep, whether she sees the images, the grimas, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs rise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at those characters.
The parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
By 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Last year she made a graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since Psych Kasten contacted the Internet, she knows she hasn't gone mad.
Creatures are also art from despair
If someone is socially isolated, or are stimulant, he'll be very likely hallucinating, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain has a lot of jobs and is taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, had, like, a little girl afraid of other kids, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out in 13 that the man that Dad has been calling since she thinks she's not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and sounds, are difficult for disabled people like Sarah K. to distinguish from each other delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "the reality is also displayed in the brain.
Hallucinations are also paintings that allow the brain to be formed, which is why it actually does so."
The dream also evaluates the Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people does not differ substantially from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, people are mentally able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
The Kasten therefore advises their patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between sleep and hallucination
In our world concentrated too much of consciousness, unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of Psychiatric and psychotherapy clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a heavy, severe disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - the delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard looked at the so-called inneroid form of experiences, a special form of changed consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams which the concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them from poor condition.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who are fully aware of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example the living, complete inability of movement, replaces life that threatens the real situation of his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality, there is no way to handle a situation, there will be a change in worlds, but the real situation will be brought to the idea.
An intensive form of supporting the senses and the transfer of senses into a situation that enables us to have our own ability to form, move right into loss of consciousness.
All is real, even later in memories
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiloid experiences in his book "Herzechsel" (Smalling of the heart) as a soul rescue event.
He was 49 years old when his heart valve followed by a heart transplant, and his body was still on the intensive care unit.
Claussen was immersed in a world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man put up in bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between a noble that makes the hallucinations of blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek takes him to his country, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets the Korean mob.
It sinks completely into imaginary history, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner ways are different to Claussen's, in principle, from any dream.
Dream is a different condition, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of these mental ways are still clear after years and in substantial detail.
Even clearer and more intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizons of our other actual experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug binding show how fragile our internal images of external reality are even in the pale state.
Every change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to deforming what we call reality."
A reality that can also be rich.
Snow can come
Burd
In 27 are to take over the publishership of children
The new manager of Kallen is a temporary solution: Hubert Burd wants to hand his business over to the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding belongs to the future 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burd sees his business long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man of SPIEGEL.
We handled the details carefully.
The question if they are also active in the company is considered later.
And the question is, do they have powers to do this?
It is not possible to build 7500 employees of their children in the head unless they are sufficiently capable.
It would kill both children and business.
Burd announced on Thursday that from January he had withdrawn from the Presidency of the board, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later on, she added responsibility for the company's assets and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenhöfera also Direct marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, there is no family member in the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "go through 10, 15 years", said Burd.
Holding should belong in the future 100 percent to the family, says Burd.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffer, Burd said that even family businesses had no security before the death: "It was always the case for companies who were allowed to infect themselves with the desire for capital that they had speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
Never had a world power dream, says Burd.
I don't think I'm the political predator of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these stores are too big.
Comprehensive Beauty Care
Everything you can wish in the area of beauty and well-being is within your hands.
This was envisaged by El Corte Inglés, who just started operating Callao (Madrid) business center for the distribution of more than 1000 m2 in which various services in the care area are provided.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and this is a time when it's appropriate to find out what the celebrities wear, and to adjust their wedding wardrobe.
The cutting shape is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to be aware.
We're making a few suggestions.
Fergie's singer chose extravagant and very complicated cut. We don't recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electromobile
Endes' energy company, together with Barcelona's council, founded 'The LIVE office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electromobile in the capital city of Catalan.
LIVE's Office (Logistics for the introduction of electromobiles) provides and manages a travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and provides agreements in the field of mobility, will manage, coordinate and present contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVEL, promote electromobility, gather views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
Barcelona, however, is not the only city to join the project to launch electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
This is three cities which the government has chosen under the MOVEL Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endes's energy company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to promote activities in the field of research and technological development in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes energy-related activities and energy efficiency in particular.
It is not the only initiative to take part in Endesa as regards the enforcement of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and is actively implementing a number of additional projects e.g.G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the room period's at the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, awaits "room period".
In the 2009 Prime Minister’s economic report, Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector today, we would have been expected to be abandoned, to close some of our main production companies," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, it is expected to be a certain period of peace for this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Motor Industry Plan (PIA), has identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies that have mobilised investments exceeding 3 billion Eur.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and for existing processes.
In addition, Zapatero stressed government support measures and mentioned plan 2000E, which applies in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed to reduce the average level of emissions for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and ensure a significant increase in entries, namely in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Hall of Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of 20 000 square meters, with more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors being represented.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid, products of all types will also be related to the world of motors.
The exhibitors in the pavilon will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products relating to classical engines, real bottlenecks for collectors and curiouss.
The following will be among the participating companies:Cláscos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and repair of cars; or Cocher Clasicos, specialised company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior competence tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be supplemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, testability, presentations and competitions.
Similarly, the eligibility tests for classical cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone will be carried out.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preservation of sport style
Mazda intends to show that the health of the environment has no negative effect on sport style.
Therefore, the Mazda3 also has a stop and start-up system - also baptised like a-Stop-, which is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, performance of the vehicle, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver's seat have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and even more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large luggage space and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is yet only available with a petrol engine for two litres and 150 horsepower and six-speed hand transmission.
This engine is a real bottle of water. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced level of noise, performance and lower consumption.
Although the most demanding Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, since it is marked by greater comfort in driving and reduced consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes more serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention, in particular, a system of monitoring lanes (RVM) that prevents the formation of dead angles, pull and stability control, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, onboard computer with large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain sensor and light,bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels from 17-inch alloys.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with a surcharge of EUR 1.500: an adaptable light of twoxenonic and sound system BOSE with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is primarily characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high levels of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not drive more miles per year can choose this version i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which amounts to EUR21.770 for Luxura and EUR 23.270 for the tested version - Sporative-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiera'
L. A. has a red carpet, fine as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled more than ever in new elegant and sexy brand models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachment or surf on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the second based on a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay for Peek six times the amount.
FonPeek, who was introduced to Le Web yesterday, is a European version of invention and at the same time its third turn.
It is limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People with smartphone already know what it means to lose data service after crossing the border or to look for a café with WiFi (or by connecting Fon) so they can view the post.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have a staggered effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name Fon, when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and considering various offers that would compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example of downloading books and other searching on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid during purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's the possibility of buying a permanent approach like this Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is the best type in consumer terms.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first ladies of the United States.
To get Barack Obama into the position of president of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color also chose to accompany him at the second most important moment of his life: giving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow green with sparkly effects - in both cases it was a three-piece kit - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same substance - decorated with a large size or collar.
At first sight, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Asturian Princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of taking Michelle's function, she used a large lace in Oslo velvet with a print.
Changes also accessories: green shoes with medium high drop, now similar model, but in gold color.
It also wears various hairstyles: this time adridol, before a dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study of 'Spainity and the work career of Spanish women' by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged between 15 and 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in opinions on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home are working part-time or have no stable work, start living with their partner earlier, having their first child and having more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner life and motherhood are postponeed and have fewer offspring.
"The women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have a first child of 3,7 years from the beginning of their relationship with their partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted more to their stable employment and therefore had to postpone partner life and arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influences on the period of initiation with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who deals with research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education is, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
The differences are also the same generation among women.
For example, between 35 and 49 years old, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to the first child before they find stable jobs, while women with secondary or higher education act on the contrary, prefer to get stable employment, before the marriage and birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious representative list: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, the German actress has become the face of the various products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I'm worth it.
The director of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most impeccable international actors, is added to another famous figure of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, they joined this selected club of actress Evangeline Lilly ('The Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionary from the chatter').
The Czech section of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey' anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'The Lost'.
UK Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and earlier - met at the annual prize delivery held in London, at theRoyal Court os Justice.
No one missed a meeting.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Esová poker' (Alphaguara, Fernando Vicente illustration) thirty X-ray photographs of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases also in his normal life).
It does not do so in obese and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but it is looking for something similar to the core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement, and Vicent does not save the covers or inspiration.
This book is an excellent readership, even during repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, just like what I feel, but it cannot be named: the benefit of anti-hosud, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not the intellectual, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without meaning as if it were a blade that nearly killed him."
Graham Green: "Our man has been set up with passion for this woman for all 13 years, adultery, pleasure, and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea was released in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight - month peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the northern side from which the best climbers often break down."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
On his own, he said he was heir to the peasants of the county, another time he was a black boy with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was the great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge a confused shout of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling into the future and speaking hard towards the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One of them knocked and prayed, "God, my beloved, please make sure I stop writing like a woman."
Joseph Conrad said: "Spenser's verses were cast on his grave: 'After an effort, there will be a peaceful port, / after the war of rest, / after the full life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
My husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her between the azals or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with neurotics whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos going about, other than targeting Joyce in Baroju?
What else was Benet's gun to get Baroju executed by Faulkner?
What else was Celo about, other than to become famous at the expense of the man's glory?"
Disgruntled aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed through our quarter, in the Fuenlabrad period, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed through the surrounding and our dog, a crossroads saved from the shelter with a weight of up to six kilograms, without a single word they kicked him twice and badly hurt him.
Our bitterness is greater that we don't see anything fun in such aggression against a small and defenceless animal, which was also on the ledge.
And to that, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on the walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil obsessed with a man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was something, and that we do not raise sensitive questions, we conclude that these cowards have been threatened by Spanish nationality.
The bitterness made us announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're talking about suffering from a defenseless animal that gives us love, company, and friendship.
We don't understand where the correct training, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together with the use of helm
The Michelin tyre manufacturer in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) launched a campaign to support the use of helmet, especially for younger motorists, as both of these entities have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries, possibly death in the event of motorcycle accidents.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their obligations relating to transport safety, which means "more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it was trying to fulfil this purpose also in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when riding on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when up to more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed in order to get to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Sale of light commercial vehicles is increased
Almost two years after the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 months of a permanent decline, according to the figures of the patron organisation of Anphac and the sellers of Ganvam.
However, the positive figure is better to put in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase over the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months accounts for 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light stones/lifts.
And they did not disappear or clouds that most damage demand, even though they were purchased by private persons, most purchases carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies and in 100% of these cases are financing through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the bad economic situation should also be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the sources of bank credit.
In the given situation, unlike passenger cars, the promotion of purchasing 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the figures of small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with an CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam again reminded us that particular attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as to industrial cars (stones and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales in passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The manual system for hand brakes is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-locking system, it will also be with the management of the stability of the ESP, the assistance of manual brake systems, all of which will become a mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they already form part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for the removal of scarcity is set, which is February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, with the effect that it can help prevent many of the collisions.
The manual hand brake system increases the brake pressure in the emergency case, which system finds out when the driver is down.
But it can't always hold this pressure till the end.
According to the study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch automotive parts, a third of drivers having an accident did not pull the brake before the collision and half of them did not use the full force of the brakes.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the braking system to maximum, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more distinctive than calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on the person-after the introduction of the so-called intelligent hand brakes systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (helps radar or camera) will capture the obstacles and report them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will make the brake as much as possible and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figuelas (Zaragoza), will be launched in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the US producer points out that more time will be needed to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is trying to make each item of the plan first agree with the party that concerns it.
As a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, will be issued late in 2010.
On the contrary, GM argues that the sales decision Saab should be adopted on these days.
No wonder the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US producer to adopt certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely who also wishes to get Volvo, but he considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which operates under the aegis of the Russian Converg group.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with either of them, GM could sell certain assets to Saab Chinese company Baic.
It shall continue to be decided by the end of Saab to close if its sale fails.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only1.275 kg.
Based on the first row, the automatic download roof is in a plated version with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; further use of aluminium doors such as GT3, which means a further 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning; 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of more than 7 kg; after the installation of sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to a 19-inch bicycle of five kilos.
Finally, the removal of the audio system by CDR-30 means another six kilograms less and the replacement of door handles by textile faults means another kilogram.
The same is offered with a two-point PDK transmission, one vehicle was tested manually lined with a six-stage speed cabinet, especially on the second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many mixed turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as inviolable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not print to the asphalt.
On the contrary, we haven't tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also transfer such safety in the movement of the corner, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of warming up muscles for a short drive during the necessary time until we can get him sprint, braking, and restore the use of the engine...
Thanks to the steering that's so communicative as accurate, whatever we're suggesting by hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he does it with surgical accuracy.
Sound the engine according to will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horses (by 10 more than Boxster S) is very supplyable and can be strengthened by the option 'sport' and through a system that modifys the sound of the engine which has already been used in the Panamery.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either during drying or recuperation.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of roads we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car was well managed by the excavators.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, we hit some of the corners at the light of the turret and the skank even in the advanced morning.
The finality of this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, because it is more than just the modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold for sale in February 2010 at EUR70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Girl Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and occasional 'starlette' on the show 'physy', the singer shows his face to an evil girl both vihementically as his bag Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Bavaria gave itself victory in Israel
The office won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during its hosting at the complicated playground Maccabi Electra, despite numerous abstractions in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus came to the head of its group after the great performance of Mirá Teletovice, which with eight three points was declared the best in the team (29 reviews).
Vitoria’s team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic’s great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
Moreover, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points was much involved in the final triumph.
The match began with a front for the blue, which from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicated that they attacked Israel’s team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first section.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team decided for the internal game Barac and the work of Eliyah, who was accepted by the whistle and kiss when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to appear as best in his team with 13 points, although without six in Splitter's evaluation indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided even in the smallest and macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that they did not win everyone at their playground, and 'the hand of Elías' were able to win.
Eidson and Pni have definitely contributed to returning to the Eidson (50-49).
More inappropriate
Ivanovic's members, injured, but not dead at all, needed a number of exact games to take breath, and in this there appeared a goal of Mirza Teletovic, which three three three almost over each other, and with the help of English and Ribase returned score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs have taken their skins in the last parts and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow someone to prepare them for the serviced results of the first 30 minutes.
However, Pini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team in life from line three points (70-77).
Despite that and Splitter excluded from Faul seIvanovic did not hate and defend themselves well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already been won by ATel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds make Unicija fight
Unicaja played a great deal in Greece with Olympiacos and left him head of Group B in Eurolyze in a fight that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagy team did not have an environment of peace and friendship or opponent, perhaps one of the most ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusan to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, lit the playground with 12-18, a minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the avalanal of locals in the inner game with Bouusus, Vjciccic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between U.S. resistance and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its predominance in both zones, where the absence of an English beer due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Among the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Unable to retaliate
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, although lost by 19, proved overweight and could even equalen the difference from the match in Malaze Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which opened up the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who had been injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicija thanks to the leadership and the triple Points of Cook and Lewis' benefits, she had a certain hope for a 66-57 win, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and overture in centimetres in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatia's beer Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja pendulum and handed over the lead of Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?

Within a week of running the application, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally feels "a bad reward", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data that Trovit has from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the best paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 4.526 of gross and French EUR 31.059, while Spain receives 24.000.
Similarly, the driver has a payment of EUR 34.247 net per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.

The most sought employment on the network in the last three months is a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil established the date of Zelay’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelay to continue in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President appointed must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when he officially ends his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d ́Affaires Brazilian embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since 21 September.
"He is aware that January 27th after the end of his mandate he must go and seek other shelters."
The station also quoted the former statesman, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline laid down: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the aegis of the Brazilian government", said Zelay by telephone.
After the election of November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would continue at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally crashed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that the government "de facto" was trying to impose on him, which was chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and rose since last spring, when asset inflation represented a predominant mood on markets, there was once again uncertainty in the markets, which should not be surprising because it is already a natural state in an environment where actors accept decisions on the future which is uncertain.
The treatment used by central banks for market stabilization was the guarantee of debt by direct purchasing of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at the near-term rate, so that financial institutions can purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct acquisitions of assets have almost ended without questioning their unsustainable liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a bit of sand into the conciliation as the Spanish central bank did with their auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterogeneous measures, and we are taking part in a return to a reduction in risk returns.
The movement of storms and the differences in bond societies has again gained points, although they are still very remote from the abnormal level they achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the US, Japan, and Germany have become a place of refuge for the selected investors, thereby expanding the differential of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain has almost not been affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction of the Kingdom's qualification.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried to re-emergence the conscience of those responsible for global economic policy due to the sounding of the destructive consequences of limiting the loan to employment, when, in fact, a new day of thanks should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs of the restoration of power in the emirates and, as regards Greece, we have seen before.
The government that covers the deficit, the election, and the new government is taking over.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconim and Sócrates in Portugal in Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and that the euro-country member states do not fulfil their obligations.
But what my logic is to force Ecofin to force the Greek government to transparency and to oblige its own citizens to share responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are located before a transitional risk premium normalisation period, after some excess on supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not need to be concerned.
If European differences are reduced and our differences continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The advantage of Standard & Poor's is just anecdota. When our leading indicators force most services of the studies to prejudge their recovery scenarios and review their 2011 growth scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, this is not a great hope for the Spanish economy to be able to achieve this warning.
Again, it looks like it's going to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, though, for the time being, careful, driving buddy.

President Iberdrol Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before the subcommittee of the Chamber, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided several comments on the proposal made to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50.000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date until 2030 if nuclear power plants are in operation.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but 95.000 million.
Iberdrol is indeed of the opinion that, over the next decade, investments need to be focused not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the question has changed and the performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and above all on renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that new 18.000 MW, but with other "prudential energy".
The galan, who believes that the bill on sustainable economy, which just approved the government, is in line with the line he requested, did not want to let go as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "excess" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that the investment decision, although long-term, has to start adopting now, because it takes time to deliver it, and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s daughter-in-law for airport ground services, Swissport, will play a role in the preferential partnership of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet taken place, has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol for the establishment of the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre yesterday
The association presupposes an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% falls on Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Accion strives for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction is estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about € 1.047 million).
Her opponents are French business Bouygues and German Hochtief.
Tunnel long 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option to settle Action as a building and concession highway in this country.
The town hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan hosted by Ernest & Young, the administration has already had a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operating of the toll.
The offers are expected to be presented in May, and the expected investments will reach USD 1.700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and at the last stage there will be three companies with significant presence in European constructions.
The Transcity group leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second based in Italy is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Against Acciona Group is in the game Northern Direct with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Bouygues Construction Group.
The third and last group which passed through the plant has the name LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (the third company of the German construction firm Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also in the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major company dedicated to the civilian construction of Ramel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering other than local construction companies.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategy followed by the said Hochtief or bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained market position through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton quoted company.
Monetary assets
Accion is betting on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier's activities and in the decontamination trade.
In addition to other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria has a group of companies that build and manages a desalation facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road subject to the toll, which is the Brisbane Infrastructure Office, called Northern Link (Northern Link), is to connect the western highway from Toowong to the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce the traffic overload of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to enter into the summer of 2010 and start working on December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for up to 2016.
Tunnel started designing in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensand government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract Hochtief
Australia still brings a significant profit to Hochtief as it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
The ACS shall operate through its local Leighton infrastructure for a wide range of national networks with a cable from optical fibers.
This situation will allow a quick Internet access of 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the tower King George on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just about to start and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC gained EUR 64,5 million in allocation of the tunnel construction through its Alpine subsidiaries.
The company received a contract several days after work on expanding the tunnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work shall be planned at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation shall be 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of EUR three million per year, informed the railway company.
The Treaty contains the possibility to extend by 12 months each year. Shra. Rushmore was selected between 16 agencies which introduced themselves in the Renfe contest, four of which joined the finale, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra. Rushmore will look after the design and production of campaigns.
Guarantee 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
The competition regulatory authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France on counter-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator reduced competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to consumers at the edge of regulation.
This sanctions by the former French monopoly and still state society has purchased more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 to impose obstacles to its competitors.
The claim imposed yesterday was increased by de facto because the Authority overseeing competition considers France Télécom to have committed a similar breach as in the past and that it was therefore recitious.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star between other operators and opened online trading to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries as Spain.
Play in the Champions League since the beginning of 476.4 million Madrid and Barça
The League of Champions has become the source of income for these clubs since 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is run by Manchester United.
The list is run by Manchester United.
Win the UEFA League of Champions does not just bring glory, and it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Up to the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish), which participated in this event since the launch of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three main prizes.
The Catalan current champion and the final winner of the Europe Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams, which in addition charged the most money for participation in the previous Liza masters.
And yet, she lost to Barça both.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has won the most money through Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (at once against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for dividing the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini is planning to make 1.090 million for Champions League.
From this money, the UEFA spends 413.1 million on solid payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification round (by other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who participated received 3.8 million only for their presence, except for the additional EUR 550,000 for each game they participate in.
There is also a prize premium (EUR 800,000) and for the tie (EUR 400,000 for each team).
Each of the last four gets 4 million.
Champion will make 9 million while second finalist 5.2 million.
In this way, at firm payments the club will make at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are moving payments to which 337.8 million are intended.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the mains and has fourlike places.
The champion of last year gets 40% of the money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published detailed offers of shares, with which it wants to obtain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for acquisitions (opce) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share to pay in ten years for which interest would be paid per year.
Yesterday Sos shares ended trading at EUR 1,85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer valued 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional upon appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez group shall provide a period of 15 days to notify shareholders of their interest in selling shares.
CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateo confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million while Sos' capitalization is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, soss continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers for purchase and settlement of the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazars, the election of María Luis Jorda was announced as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to take a high function in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be led directly to the president of the group.
And it is not removed from the field because the company is still in a legal battle with an alleged movement of more than 230 million from Sos by the Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot be subject to the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months
As regards Salazar's credit card yesterday, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega Board and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja Actors) confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows the exclusion option of Paterina, which was involved in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) voted yesterday to exclude Inversor Mer from the Federation Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the adjustments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at obtaining 50.008 shares of Federica Paterina at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
Furthermore, it explained that 5.592.778 million shares were derecognitioned, which would not be transferred in any way until an offer has been concluded that the price had been determined by the Federation of Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car valuation tools
These days, storms and accidents make not only autoservices.
Each day is thousands of cars that have suffered a insurance event being taken to the service where the expert must estimate the damage and costs of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of working force can be long and complex work.
Calculate manually the repair costs from EUR 20.000 to EUR 30,000 including parts and working forces can take two or three hours.
However, it would be a question of minutes with the support of new computer tools
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information that manufacturers provide to them in order to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatax, the American group is the manager of the company; 80% of the rating is performed with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation and sector information processing are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturer is not simple at all.
According to Eduard Velazquez, Sales Director Audatax, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of processing data is increasing as more versions, variants and solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very hot job, because we need to catalog each of thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "smart" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "off" individual parts of the tourist cars.
As far as the model with massive sales is concerned, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
About the mobile park in circulation exceeds 99%.
For the execution of documentation and databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The home is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 technicians (normally mechanical experts) working at the same time with three computer screens.
The Audatax invests EUR 90 million per year in the production of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous stream of information allows businesses to use and supply different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to each country there are also tools to control spare parts or calculate the car’s sales or residual value.
The only business with a guide, which informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain, is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different units, with AudaPlus's star product, the standard solution for the award of insurance events for the expert.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the parts costs, it shall also include time to repair estimated by the manufacturer or by the lacquer.
This tool shall be applied according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, not more than ten times a month.
Then every insurance undertaking carrying out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatax.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which they are based on the assembly line only on the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to a professional sector on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with a total insurance event.
His statistical service is very useful to identify tendency, to perform geodemographic analysis or to detect deviations according to marks or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modeled brands went through the service due to the crash or how much serious insurance events have suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company devoted to the development of such instruments.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group established in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to damage, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Guinea valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.300 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover volume increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 they charged EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, an internationalization process began in Paris.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it was established in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother is made up in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoice of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Soler's group stood at $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007 he has been anchored on the stock exchange in New York and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought a Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after insurance events.
The operation assumed an upsizing EUR 59.5 million of 85% of the company's capital to expand in the next year by the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is provided exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental houses, services, sale of spare parts and professional dealers who must register before the operation starts.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
They manage 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish act of the car whose number of the chassis has been removed, it cannot return to operation, but may be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be permitted to operate, although they have been disabled after the preliminary proceeding.
Maintenance of the service in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user receives the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creating a budget and generating.
Easiness of use is a crucial condition for these systems, especially for the beliefs of professionals of older age who are more or less persistent in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which hiking 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 truck.
Naturally for use, a computer with Internet connection is required.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the number of the chassis, there is a real graphic display of the model and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user may include variables such as the cost of working force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an award tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is focused on the service and does not include an estimate of the labour force.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year which the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex is working on making these views three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics welcome because it allows for example to choose a door and turn them around to show the inner side.
