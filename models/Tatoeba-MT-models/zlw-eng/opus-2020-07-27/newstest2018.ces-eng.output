The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for Benefits of Coloring People (NAACP) published a warning for colourful people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory principles of state and racist attacks.
“The NAACP’s recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and the inhabitants of Missouri to pay greater attention when travelling across the state due to a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the country,” says the Association.
NAACP stated that this step was taken on the basis of the current law of the state of Missouri, which makes it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts in court, as did the criminal proceedings aimed at minorities disproportionately.
“Citizen rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said the President of NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have the greatest complaints so far."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organization issued for the US State.
Among the incidents the organization quoted were racially motivated abuses directed towards students by black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, men of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year after his gas ran across the state and the police threw him into custody without a charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent statement by the High State Council of Missouri, which states that black skin drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping them.
"The aim of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People must be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail or warn their relatives that they are planning to travel by the State.”
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme, reports of hateful acts occurred in Missouri in 2015 on hundreds of cases of hate conduct, which indicates the state to a 16th place between all states.
At the same time, travel is a response to the New Law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to sue society for discrimination when providing accommodation or employment.
The US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States have approved an immigration law that allows state officials to hold people under violation of this law, which is designed to improve racial profiling according to ACLU.
The travel recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Countries, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family hasn't even been calm in 12 years!
The killer is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
A girl originating in Croydon was murdered by chef Mark Dixi in 2005, directly at the restaurant where she worked, who planted her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, and then he killed her.
The killer sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough criminalist work to search for the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to release freedom of 34 years for murder and rape by Sally's models.
He admitted only to assaulting a minor and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had been fighting for good nights.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"Absolutely attracted the attention of the taxi driver," said the lie.
The girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, although she could, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his insistence and his taste for a girl.
When he dressed after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light a marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, he told the police himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, which is why he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," she added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family is facing other attacks from the vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," she told the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda about missing the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither prude nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs Prague's Intimity boutique.
In it you will find designer and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started inconspicuous, approximately 12 years ago.
Martin and his friends went on a cycle year after Moravia.
One of them did not only bring a bicycle, but also a box full of insurmountable vibrators.
" Various moles and dolphins, and all of them were green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me about lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with one other partner with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which was interested in Martin, and so he offered to help with marketing.
When his partner left to serve other professions, he replaced him.
Today he operates in the Prague Benedictian Street boutique Intimity, where he sells erotic aids in a way that is usually offered luxury purses or shoes.
And why wouldn't he?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fair Fun Factory, designed by the recognized designer Karim Rashid, served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone else is used to.
No coverings, all made in beautiful, delicate style, products exposed more than in perfume.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka started to reflect on how to take the Prague store where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimity liked both of them.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's also, it can be said, tender," she says.
She followed the purchase of the internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, she won a variant that spread the store into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom with a waterbed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpán from FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
First, he didn't look perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting in the name of Intimity again.
It's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one buys any customers," Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a deal that will be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mainly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they've ever entered such a business.
When I walked into Intimity's boutique half an hour ago, the street was emptiness.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior known from the fashion boutiques.
Although there's only a woman's service in the store, it doesn't mean that women don't get to ask for help, it doesn't mean that the man's foot doesn't come in here.
Most of the gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their friends.
"My men are mostly unable to estimate the right size and choose bigger," Martin is smiling over a lot of mistakes.
It's these prejudices, the clichés that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses a uselessly large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, whereas a woman tends to be more of a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product of theft called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the expression in my face that I don't know which beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a stimulant clitoris stimulant.
Pere needs to get caught up in me with the admiration of the serious tone I'm being used to interpreting.
It's like they're not snooping around.
And it doesn't really make sense.
It is worth a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's kind of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care of the fact that women were more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely demolished the taboo that some men may endure in erotic aids see competition.
"There are various variants," continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a control freak in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the other hand, the category of insertable vibrators is a fault.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they need to use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, is very popular.
What about the men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work solely for men.
It would have to be taken a little differently.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have a little help for them, but to a limited extent." The most is sold mainly by the Masturbator, in this case by the manufacturer Tenga.
Because it does not look like anatomical vagina, but "you sleep like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It concentrates on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, this is completely different.
It's embarrassing in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot from erotic aids, I suggest.
"That's the Internet reality," explained to me.
The day-to-day is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Only for interest - what the Japanese sign Tenga is, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs aren't very forward.
On the contrary, we are a wholehearted nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the business ranges between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience but has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
She will come for something nicer, better than she would have completed her partner life or herself." In order to come back, Martin Roż and her business partner Zdeněk Šebelka are old enough to convince each product whether it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go to a bandation and latex special, because we don't have room for it, but it doesn't really fit in here.
Such things could be discouraged by the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been ashamed to go to the sex shop because they were afraid they'd look at them like that.
Many of the products displayed on the shelf are truly lovely.
It is also given by the selection of represented brands.
Some of them even gained design prices, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first awarded was the marine horse "and it triggered a change throughout the sector.
It started to escape from cheap materials and, on the other hand, to work with healthyly harmless, to produce other designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that some of them are behind the design of Czechs, although popular designer Anna Mareš.
I have to say, I'm quite surprised how many people have the designs of Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareš buys, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who go directly to Venus's balls from Anna Mareš.
She did a really huge job in the Czech Republic and abroad, presenting exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nice, with a story.
Anne's story started as a school job.
Now it's a finished product, which is also manufactured in our country.
I wanted to have a process of production under control, and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo makes the products.
Because it's not a large product, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
I may be going a little against the current, but I think it's important to keep my development in the Czech Republic.
In a few years, it could be easier for us to be able to produce anything," he later describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin, that our company is becoming more and more open.
He doesn't meet with a negative or repetitive attitude.
I hear people are despaired.
"But even then they will smile." Now Anna Mareš has a vibrator on offer that you can make a personal message for you, and this year he also plans his own lubricant gel.
In the next year, there should be vibrating eggs and other news news.
Borders of healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Reage wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one person, another may seem totally abnormal, so we're more of a range of branded producers.
None of them are allowed into some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the most insane demand they've received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in which some lady demanded a masturbation aid for her friend with the birth of a long 20 inches.
So we had to write that down that we didn't have anything, unfortunately.
The question is, if anyone's making fun of us, Martin's got a suspicious look at me.
And that happens from time to time...
A wound for Karl Gott.
After two cancers of Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Happy is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is struggling with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately, it is true," confirmed the sad flash information itself, the singer.
I know about my illness and I'm handling it in the light of circumstances.
"I'm taking drugs that are supposed to slow down the disease," he added that he thanks his loved ones for their support.
The whole family has moved here to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as possible, her father's house on the White Hora also comes from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, taking care of Karel's son, called Karas.
The generous man fought twice with cancer and gave his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He's got 60 chemotherapy on him.
He was able to return to work and to tennis court and ski slopes.
"From an astrologer I have foretold to be here by the '90s," said Karel Lightning.
He's a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating my words to keep me from forgetting them," Karel admitted.
Květa Fial has been fighting with the same disease now in the constitution as well.
Do you have a patient in your family with Alzheimer's?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chinese Parliament has repealed the ban on interference, the law will judge the ÚS.
In Chile, the absolute ban on artificial interruption of pregnancy is still in force, and therefore, for health reasons, it must not be done.
"I feel like the legislators filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August should get a new chair, which according to AFP is a close opposition.
The law breaking the absolute ban on interference, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The rule opposition then announced that the law would attack the court, because according to her, it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Members put aside the vote on the bill last month until the Joint Parliamentary Commission analyses it.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and again made the Senate.
According to the new legislative regulation, there should be a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened if the fetus does not have a chance of survival, or if pregnancy is caused by rape.
There were similar exceptions under the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, i.e. before women received election law in 1949.
The absolute ban on interference in 1989 introduced the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet just a few months before the President's office left.
Chile is one of the few countries of the world where absolute prohibition of interference applies.
The others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to thirty-year prison sentences for interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is Socha Freedom now
A false sign of a change in mode is a critical sculpture.
Americans could talk about it just as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged reduction of the Saddam Husajn statue on the Baghdad Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was going on when in a passionate debate with the reporter CNN Jim Acosta on the subject of president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants with a symbolic axe at the Freedom Alliance.
It's easy to say that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, the crowds of cruise owners and imitators of Socha Freedom would be lynched by him.
However, he attacked its significance, namely, that in 1903 a poster with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the stand, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
“ I don’t want to get into history here, ” Miller said, “but Socha Svoboda is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the stand is not a part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, it's not about history.
This is mainly the surprising words of Emma Lazarus, who are resonating today - inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest of the poorest: "Let him go to me who has fallen, who can breathe freely, who can barely breathe in the midst of the cities."
And just in modern times, we can be better than ever before to watch these "bad worms" on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to find out about the criticism of poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict of American importance.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who after her death sought to put the posters with poems on the statue stand, knew quite well that they were going into a high political game.
Socha was supposed to express the connection between the French and the U.S. Republican government by representing a classic theme, i.e. the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem there is no female character abstract, but she has her own voice.
She has a very different name: the mother of the evictions.
The merger of poems with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastation attack on American Naziism.
And the same way Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of statues, the rightmen long tried to undo this meaning.
A well-known commentator Rush Limbaught - Jan Baptizer in the case of Trump’s onset to power - in 2010 argued that Socha Svoboda was not really inviting anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the lost world: “Soch Svoboda continues forward.
It produces the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's posology is in the middle of an important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger who often comes after a long and scary cruise across the ocean with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a view of the world by the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses the statue of hope and listens to their needs.
And, of course, this is a perspective that Miller and Trump will certainly not know.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to provoke hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup in Athletic 2017: Neil Black is praised by Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the British team had only two Scottish members.
Director of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom of Neil Black said that a strong quadra 16 Scots on the team of World Championships will be “a huge asset for the team”.
For MS in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that “ something special happens in Scotland” and British athletes could hardly learn from Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
“I spoke with people from the Scottish Sport Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The leaders of Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they've done.
That's what people in the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in a race of 5000 m while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“ Some athlete, whether Scotsmen or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The passion and the uncircumcised feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the run over obstacles to his fifth world championship, stated that it is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The jock in Muir's high school route has set five British and two European records for the last year only.
The MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. This season won British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship in which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team has led to the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues were made to the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about the team captain's office is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by members of the team is comforting," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who have entered the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the fronts on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's happening on homeland.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back to the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm gonna enjoy the amazing atmosphere."
Blocking the critics on Facebook: do not take care of the public function unless you bear the criticism of the voters
Our country's father knew about his criticism.
The American George Washington loved her, but the newspapers weren't long enough to criticize her for anything, starting with domestic politics, and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism didn't leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to keep his mouth shut.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “The fruit of speech can be taken away from us, and the foolish and the Germans will be led as sheep at slaughter.”
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on getting him acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union.
The employees of the governor rejected the action as unfounded, and many views on the Internet have appeared in the comments of the type "who cares".
“It’s just Facebook,” said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not poppy.
As is clear, the state manages its own and strictly respects the principles.
It turns out he's also skillful in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his voters - except for the publication of the first photograph with the naked head after attending chemotherapy.
Blocking people that close to the governor's side - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his staff paid by taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor that the blocking of comments took place in a position to modify the contributions.
However, it is too easy to use the image of Internet trolls, spamers or angry people.
Washington Post interviewed some real people who had deleted contributions.
And that is exactly exactly what - real people who speak to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not cruel.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment, calling upon Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hateful crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I humbly noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hateful crimes and other current reports," she wrote in a section with comments from the Washington Post daily.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are identified as promoting the so-called collective effort instead of being recognized as a larger group of citizens."
What the governor’s employees called “centralised spam interest” would be likely to call another “defense”.
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism or arrest or silenced Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for the shame of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors broke the first amendment in Alexandria, which prevented one of the voters' access to her Facebook page, according to the district judge James C. Cacheris.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky has also waited for visits from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington times, she had a low postage price virtually the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was multiplied and many anonymous writers questioned his position as leader.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under the pseudonym "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the people within the online project Papers of George Washington Project, the petitions criticised in his office with regard to the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disapproval and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the true leader must accept that.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
Foreignly Czechs use more of their tariff than at home.
They are most often moving in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season takes Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to ram on the web, especially under the sun, they usually do not have the ability to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming, and a smart phone in your hand.
So it looks typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the service of their home operators.
This results from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available in the framework of the paušál than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum of our followers travel through winter, this summer season has increased even 50 times.
In the second place, Italy placed the data consumed.
Most minutes Czechs are calling from Germany, where many are going to work during the summer.
Croatia, according to the data of the Czech travel agency, visits to 800,000 Czechs every year, so our most popular destination.
But people here have exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was July 7th.
"The data transmitted would fit tens of millions of photographs," explains the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Even though Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
Austria is at first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is four and Italy is six.
To Austria, we are heading for a walking tourism and an active holiday that we don't have so much time for online twilighting.
"More than Austria, the Czech Republic is heading for the Adriatic," explained Cieslar.
While in the data, the operator has recorded high year-on-year growth after the roaming charges have been released, the telephony growth is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming increased to twice last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead in front of other countries.
"The roaming call uses company customers on business travels," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
In the next three days, the former Ronan Rafferty golfer will hope for a pleasant atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative region of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th year of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who came from Northern Ireland last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on the way to the finals according to Paul Eales. This year, he will perform the role of Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the first-class playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
The tournament is in the right hands."
English Eales will first defend a master title, despite winning the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the earth is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I had a real win for my wife.
It was a beautiful time I would never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after he celebrated 50 years from the country of this year, returns to home land.
This event will be his first participation by Aberdeen Asset Management Scotty Open in 2013.
"I'll always like to play home," said Orr about Helensburg.
“You want it to work out and you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really happy to play again, and I think I'm doing great.
I'm happy with the result I've achieved."
The three players also join a former Masters Ian Woosnam winner on the field and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access to the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Chudoba and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses pans.
In its wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the speech of local “not” - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, she will choose the potato and taste it with her unwashed hands.
Bardina sits in a mudy country - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing the laundry in turbulent water from the nearby marshmallow.
A bucket in a room without a roof gives you a toilet.
As the youngest of her four wives, she was not assigned any field to serve.
Polygamy is common here.
Work until late nights poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. Moreover, the village has soldiers.
"This afternoon after 5:00, no one is allowed to roam around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of the daily life in Papua University, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after the controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by public uplifting their hands before the occupation army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Romanian government, which ruled the whole region, except for foreign journalists or civil rights overseers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so far away and a desolated city where you will reach the ninety-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach with a ride.
Mass transport in this place doesn't work.
The town with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty colors.
Only a few Indonesians looked at this place, including journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We are not used to wearing these clothes," says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-dressed turban, dark t-shirt and bright dress.
"We used to carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and the child's mortality and gravity is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the U.S. Pheenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province of approximately 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport made gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated value of 78 billion dollars.
However, these wealthes are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid to local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the amount of $150,000 for one officer.
The parrots who cry for self-inflictedly threaten this gold goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, over 500 000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, raped and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papua Tribal Area over the 1970s have been genocid as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
The Indonesian police in the region only arrested over 3900 peaceful Protestants last year.
We Will Lose Everything, report from 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, as out-of-court executions, torture - according to other reports, is especially popular rape and execution by electric current - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was making it difficult for the papal resources to attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province here, 83% of Christianity are reported, but demography is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javian cantains sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people fight for survival.
"Immigrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains the four-year-old Abeth You, who was born on Paniai and moved to Jayapura Province in charge of the capital.
"The original inhabitants of Papuy - Mama-mama - have lost their job."
As part of his 2014 presidential campaign, President Joko Widodo promised to address inequality and violations of rights.
The former emperor has secured and made his way to the presidential palace of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panaai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and locals feel injured.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would hear our calls for justice," said You.
The fact is, only two months after October's inauguration of Jake had a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched this extract and the tone, which was spoken, and later returned to four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Teai.
Two of the soldiers in the subsidized state followed a group of children and beat them with arms, brought victims and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the constituency of the electoral commission, and the next day things were still happening.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the soccer field in front of local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came up with the rite hunting gaps and they performed the waita dance - in which they ran in the circle and imitated the singing of birds - the papal tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones on the building.
With the increasing voltage, the order was given to the soldiers via the radio: “If the crowd attempts at at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot,” said TIMME in an official document whose contents were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), Head of Enarotali Koto District, recognized the dangers and called on the residents to spread into their homes.
However, no one had a doubled on his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said the week TIMME on the porch of his glass-painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was yet, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around, and a lot of fire was fired," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was struck three times.
“I went to the body to convince myself that it was really him,” said TIMME, a sad voice from Yohanes, who, like many Indonesias, only uses one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers were only providing a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to die," said the press secretary of the Papuan Police in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiya.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many of them were injured.
The murder report could have been the next day by Jakartské media.
Three weeks later, he gave Jok in Jayapura a passionate speech and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I require immediate solutions to this problem so that it can never repeat itself," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security announced that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts in the past.
Almost immediately, but they began to call excuses.
“ Most violent acts have taken place a long time.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're determined to punish these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
In an interview of 5 June for the week TIMME, which took place in Jakarta, he claimed that he was not planning to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought to judgment. ”
The United Nations accused of “criminal crimes” on the basis of more than one thousand dead people during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been compared so far, including the incident in Pania.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Pania welcomed his statement of distrust.
"I have been questioned a total of four times in the last three years, but I have not waited until now," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later, he still lives in fear.
"I fear," as he claims.
"I fear the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of the inhabitants of Pania who are afraid of the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After my body was buried, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting doesn't stop yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
There was one person who died and another 17 was injured, between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned in fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
An angry villagers protested outside the building of society.
According to the statement by the police, villagers were throwing after their respective stones and the response was a warning shooting.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indian paramilitarian police) began shooting into a crowd and killing one person.
"It was a panic, we were afraid of payback," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed his arrival.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has been required to punish the police involved and to withdraw the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the strains of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central colleges.
Many joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - the army of rebels who protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kaya.
As a result of the attacks of the army in recent years, thousands of inhabitants of Paniai have been arrested and held arbitraryly, all under the excuse of “the assurance of national sovereignty”.
Some of them never see again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuaa as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil pours poverty into the fire.
Few rice that sells in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
Here, the inhabitants of their food grow: sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them makes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are designed for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport has opened several air routes and new immigrants have started to flow to the country, economic imbalances have increased between native Papuans and immigrants.
In general, so few jobs will be occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Paluans rarely have the necessary capital and education to let themselves into business.
“ Young people move from the village because of the shortage of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of Panaai.
Because of isolation, Papua is hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Francck Escudie and Basel Longchamp - were fired out of papaya because of the lack of cooperation with the authorities, all of which, despite the fact that they received such a rare permit for filming.
Phleim Kine, representative of the Human Rights Watch Organization, Jok promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"The foreign journalists working in the most violent areas of Papua and Western Papua are at a high risk: non-recognition of visas and inclusion on a black list" said the statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six pacifical nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - United Nations Human Rights Council on the investigation of "various and widespread violence" in Papua, including shootings in Pania.
In the past, these countries have also supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian State Department, Arrmanath Nasir, made accusations when he told the journalists in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals call for participation in foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the MP for human rights Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people called according to the source, which was also attended by the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "We want freedom".
For 2019, other elections are planned in Indonesia, but the parrots claim not to vote for Jok.
“Jok is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania,” said Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jok to know that the inhabitants of Panai - besides living in constant fear of the robbery army - are rolling in poverty, poor education and health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Panaai, like the other Papuans, consider their voice “long, ” which he must pay to Jok.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Virgin Islands, they continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on land across from police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be taken for enough, at least they will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," Yacobus said, "he was stuck in the head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has been detained in a Pacific yacht with 1,46 tons of cocaine worth about $ 256 million.
The shipment went to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship, apparently formed by the people of Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested during the intervention.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police pulled it to the port in Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Austral Intelligence stated that in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where the drugs were coming from and where they were headed, and to reveal the "Litish Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a lot of drugs going to Australia," said the Executive Director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of growing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
This is not the case at present.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, which tried to smuggle through the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
The seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to remind them of the drinks.
This problem may be in the home for seniors, according to the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavela Mádlová could be the infusion of the physiological solution that mix the thin needle under the skin.
But they only apply to medical devices so far.
The older you are, the more the water falls in his body.
"And in addition, the feeling of thirst loses, so the seniors generally accept less fluids and very quickly dehydrate," said Mádlová.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
There are often no physicians watching in the senior homes.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually handled by infusions.
"I think even there should be a gradual introduction so that they can receive a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In her opinion, up to two-litre bottles of physiological solution may be added to old people in a day.
Lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is shown to be an absolute loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," he added.
In case of neglect, it can result in brain events.
Blood's going to go down, and it's clogging blood in the brain, and there's also a risk of kidney failure.
Lie patients should not be covered with a seal, maximum cotton sheets.
The problem can also be disposable diapers.
"It's a more demanding nurse, but it would be ideal for the patient to discover and allow the skin to blow," said the doctor.
In Dubai, the sky was on fire for the second time.
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world’s largest living clouds was found in the flames. Firemen had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floors of buildings.
In the last two years, this is already the second fire of this college building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (the West).
The cause of the fire is unknown.
“ We slept and woke up an alarm. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geoge, one of the inhabitants of the skycraper.
Dubai's civilian defense stated that firemen managed to get fire under control around the fourth morning hours (20:00 GMT) while continuing to cool down buildings.
Government officials have added that they provide spare accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again lead to discussions on the safety of materials used to cover tall buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation, which launched the management of skycraper Torch after fire in 2015, it appeared that the most damage was to the lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation.
The British police said that the insulation system and coverage of the London Grenfeld Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire, where nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the survey have shown that more than one of the five passengers to the USA do prohibited items on board the aircraft
The survey among passengers has shown that more than 20 percent of them are consciously or unconsciously made prohibited items through the control posts of the US Government Transport Security Administration on the aircraft deck. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft deck with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they were late to discover that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1000 questions responded - it appeared that in younger passengers there is a greater likelihood of breaking the rules.
From respondents who admitted that they had attempted to travel knowingly with the subject of banning TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flight compared to less than 15 percent of the members of generation X.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of the TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents consciously made a sharp object, while 2.2% of the women asked for and 3.7 percent of the men concerned also admitted that they deliberately carried out illegal drugs on board aircraft.
The company stated that it carried out research between passengers around the world to see how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have passed unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel the plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directive is somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can pass on to the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA has seized the highest amount of just banned fluids.
At some point, people thought TSA would be dealing with books in the same way as it was with stuffed goods.
Transmission of fluids is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the deferral of the proposed directives to reduce the emissions of Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency has been sued by 15 countries, its boss Scott Pruitt called off his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan, thus reacting more light than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position at the federal appeal.
This concerns the last date, which was set for October 1, when countries should begin to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and provide a more detailed study of the plan in order to avoid "consistencies with local decisions or threats to economic growth".
Pruitt, who long served as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations before joining the role of Head of EPA, Donald Trump.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or separate the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden midday turnover is the greatest legal failure for Pruitto's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal appeal court in Washington decided that the contractor of the EPA exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the integration of the Obama administration plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce the leakage of methane.
In the statement issued on Wednesday evening Pruitt suggested its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA commitment to cooperation with countries through complex processes and implementation of new standards in the given time frame.
“For the government of the previous EPA administration, she often did not meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with settlement and further setting up of plans,” Pruitt said, who put more than a dozen complaints on the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in the regulation by means of judicial proceedings and by the implementation of the term we take seriously.
We never joke about our statutes and authority which results from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use ‘the possibility of delaying and all other legally available authority’ to ensure that the regulation ‘will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information’.
The Republicans at Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month aims to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure is still not passed by the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in charge of the coalition of the states that were sued by the EPA this week, said that the group did not intend to authorise in legal pressure.
"In the opinion of the EPA, following our trial, it is an important victory for health and safety of the 6.7 million non-nationals and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when normal harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in vulnerable people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists have a sudden change to Pruitt's thanks.
“It is worrying what pressure needs to be made to change the thinking of responsible persons and to protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre of Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight with the ideological campaign of Trump administration, which tries to help pollutes and special interests."
Polil man with acid, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you laugh, the other one suddenly changes your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopher of Great Britain, whose face was glued by acid by an unknown attacker who was finally released from guilt.
Information provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopher's.
Andreas picked up that he was going to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door to deliver Christmas presents for his family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he's never seen before, right after he opened it without warning, he's done it with acid, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was incorruptible.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I only felt the pain on the skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly moved him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned a terrible news - according to the doctors, he had no chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patients would be infected that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
With 90 percent, the face that doctors tried to put together using skin from another part of the patient’s body was struck.
Christophesus has become a loss of eye wax for great complications.
It's probably the worst thing I've ever seen.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopher has completed 12 operations that are not the last.
The injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical surgery and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after the demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight against deformation and defrostion for life," said Professor Peter Dawulski, spokesperson of British plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christopher is sure that an unknown man had to be with someone.
The perpetrator believed that the revenge of the man who sexually abused his close person.
The police have checked the case properly and the attacker has searched again.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the wonder of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"Three judges finally concluded that the penalty should be lifted because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the past few years, the number of assaults with eating substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Interior expressed its intention to provide new guidance to the state representatives on the classification of food.
Those should be classified among dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not intend to surrender.
They require the UK government to enforce more stringent and longer sentences to repel freedom for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require that strict checks be made on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different trades, as these are various cleaners.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai burned in the night famous skycraper The Torch, which belongs to the world's largest residential buildings.
According to Dublin civil defence, the population of the 80-story building was able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the Dublin police spokesman, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several inhabitants of the house, this was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, as they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by the Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with the falling wreckage.
We slept.
The alarm woke us up, people shouted.
"We went down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," described George's tenant's events.
Another one of CNN's witnesses estimated that the flames kept about 40 flats.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when they caught a burning section of the building.
About two hours later, according to the civilian defense message, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of his formation is not yet known.
According to the Witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current went off.
The vast fire damaged the Dublin skycraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
There was nothing happened to anyone at that time, because the residents were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metres tallest residential building in the world.
The record was issued by another Dublin skyscraper the following year.
The cultist had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a three-year-old Ippolity sample had a full collection of unauthorized devices - from steroids to diuretics to medicines for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, it ended fourth.
Now the body's at risk of four-year-old distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragbista David Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was until then a record quantity for the affected athletes.
A three-way player began taking steroids year before he fell through the culture.
Lucka Vondrakková in the Czech Republic.
She's got a hard time hugging her ex-girlfriend!
Not only did Lucka Vondráčková enter the territory of the Czech Republic, in one round.
And he will also pay attention to wherever he comes.
The last time she fell into her arms was by her former lover Michal Dlouh, who lived with her for three years.
The actor was 12 years older then, and he wanted for his family.
Lucia was only 19 years old, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went apart, but friends stayed until today.
Which was also proven at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
The two of them came together in a blue color.
At first, they didn't notice each other, but then Lucie got closer, and she laughed at Michal's pranks when she fell over her belly.
Then they'd hugged themselves, and the photographers would willingly pose.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they would play a lover couple on the new Prime Captain Exner series.
Islamists have been given life in Great Britain for the preparation of the bomber.
The British court sent for life on Thursday for four members of the Islamic cell, which was called Three Musketeers, and, according to the D.A., it planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were already convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unfaithful" in Arabic, and a gun make-up.
This happened when the MI5 secret service agent set up a listening device in the car.
"The new bombers showed what terror the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said the prosecutor at Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial, the men in London claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car placed an MI5 agent in there.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendant's claim.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodonin, they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday temperature record 37.3 degrees Celsia remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia, recorded in the Watchtower in Hodonín, it overcame Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by workers of the Czech hydrometherological Institute.
But there wasn't a lot of temperature records compared to Tuesday.
On Tuesday, records to 35 of 145 meteorological stations were overcome or settled for over 30 years.
On Thursday, record temperatures were only recorded by nine long-term measuring stations.
Maybe there was a quarter-temperature in the Watchtower the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclav, Thursday, 37.4 degrees overrun the original maximum of four tenth degrees and in Pohřelice in Brno, current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, just like the Watchtower, came from 2013.
In the west, there were ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watch Tower was the biggest heat in Dyjákice in Znojsk and Broda nad Dyje in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37,8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, for example in Western and Northwestern Bohemia, the fourth highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsia, according to the ČHMTU site.
"The temperature began to grow there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists told.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually sound, and on Sunday, more significant rains may come.
At most places in Moravia, however, they will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia as well as Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing's losing billions to visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without using force-free resources.
Every year, it spends $10 billion in support of language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushes its fun industry into foreign markets and tries to attract western tourists.
That's not good for Beijing.
There is a state media talking about a plan to turn the tourism into a driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global ambitions, China does not welcome a stranger with an open arms, evaluates the situation in the world's most popular country, professor of economics from the University of Peking Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free ties with China, the citizens of the others must take a visa with advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the USA, therefore, the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $ 140, but if you don't want to wait a long hours in the front, you have to pay $100 and more for extra services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited Estonia, while Hong Kong, which is less than three percent of China’s domestic product and less than one percent of its inhabitants live there, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring reduced its transport to South Korea, as part of the collapse around the South Korean Anti-raket System, the South Koreans paid her back, and the Chinese avoided.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recently published reports by the US Central Bank Fed, China could have left up to $190 billion as a result of the foreign travels of China, while China, as part of the sale of currencies, receives about $35 billion per year to tourists.
According to official numbers on the development of the balance of payments, China had a $217 billion deficit last year in Turism, equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, who are anxious to defend the capital flow, are planting a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one expression of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places, China has hardly heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are more in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has twice.
Many scientific work shows that immigrants are usually reinvigorating economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But you can't practically find them in China.
These problems will be politically demanding, but the step offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts lately to simplify and lower visa certification procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the pledging zoo, they reproduced deadly reptiles.
The Plzen Kingdom poison can enjoy three rare, deadly, toxic reptiles.
Only all nine freshly born Turkish disappearances will be seen by visitors at the exhibition.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"A growing length is growing," said Zoo Martin Vobruba.
The young men of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras of the red, will gain strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't tell you when people see them.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal about it being a year or two.
Austral's deaths came to the world of eight, they're the offspring of a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The only person that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the deaths from the Perth area," said Vobrub with the need to winter 6-8 weeks in human care at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsia.
A hundred percent success accompanied a collection of African spitting cobras of red.
A couple in a pledging zoo hatched out of four eggs of a total of four babies.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," Vobrba added.
This species in nature will spray the poison on its victims, within a distance of up to four metres.
He's heading for the eyes, he can cause permanent blindness.
The babies of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they're still waiting for the hatching of the cubs of the black mamba, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an incredible transcript of a telephone conversation, Trump is creating a pressure on Mexico due to payment for a border wall
The Washington Post American daily published a transcript of President Trump's telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In his phone interview of January 27 with the Mexican President Enrique Peña, Trump requested him to stop publicly saying that he will not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US President said to him that he publicly condemns the building of the wall, saying: "You cannot speak like this in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and reported that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also leaked his first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tight exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US Surveillance Agreement on Refugees going to Australia was "smell" and "dumbly" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's reign - would look like "drained" after he proposed a ban on entry refugees into the US.
Trump terminated the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most uncomfortable call to the day.”
Tusk re-explained the Procuracy for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," declared Tusk's brother of the dead president, President of the Government Party of Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski will not frighten me," Tusk sent and told the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
When he left the D.A.'s office, he waited for Tuska, according to TVN 24 crowds, which was chanting Donald Tusk! and wanted politics for 100 years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczyński will not frighten me."
The prosecutors say nothing works, but he doesn't doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, oppositions or people who don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to this group.
He was the second time in the interrogation.
The expremier was questioned at the Procuracy for the second time, this time the interrogation was about doubts in the postmortem victims of the Smolenic disaster.
Because there has been an extravagation of the body in the coffin.
The families banned the coffins from opening up, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason is that they were afraid of scandals because they would burden the Polish-Russian relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński said on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that any conflict with Russia would have given Tusk the chance to obtain the most important chair in the union, which Poland had absolutely nothing to do with.
At the same time, Kaczyński declared that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might have been different with Donald Tusk, but it did not take any notice.
Tusk has submitted an eight-hour questioning for the Procuracy on April 19th.
He didn't even talk as a suspect at the time, only as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning were considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the boss of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by connecting with various scandals.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is under the authority of the Minister of Justice in Poland, acting as General Prosecutor.
The appeal for questioning came after the election of Tunisia to the head of the European Council, which Kaczynski sought to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkel in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested at the EU Summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Mr. Varšav left Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the shavings and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters of power will be newly voting for the composition of Houses from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It's coming from a decree that adjusts the delivery of voting tickets to a foreign.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, at the moment it is in the comments procedure.
Four years ago, Members abroad voted 10 thousand Czech citizens.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifys its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices were created, some authorities were closed, or there was a change in the level of representation," is written in the material.
The notice shall contain two Annexes, first of which shall indicate the representative offices to which the paper voting tickets are to be delivered.
This group of offices include the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will get a voting ticket in the version for printing.
Their list is changing by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote for example at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassys are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in the Maltese Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
He's not even going to vote for a consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014, due to war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassys in Nairobi, Venezuela, the capital city of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has extended its representation of the general consulate in Iraq and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-chchuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassys in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs in the foreign country had the opportunity to select Members in electoral rooms at representative offices or consuls so far four times.
Before each election of the State electoral committee, a country for which candidates shall be voted abroad shall be determined by chance.
It was for the first time in 2002 when it decided between South Moravian candidates.
During the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad between South Czech candidates.
In 2013, the Mediterranean Region was selected as this year.
The number of Czechs in the foreign country is increasing stablely.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote, and in 2006, they were around 6700, four years later 8222.
Early Roman elections four years ago came to the embassy 10.571 voters.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: activists remembered racist lynching
From 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the sightings of Monroe, Georgia, and codercal towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men replaced it with weapons.
Leader of the group - the middle-aged man in a puddle suit - long stretched out of a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want to do it n--and Roger!" a man screamed.
Bring him to me!
Silence breaks the screams of a young black man who's pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22nd.
But when one of the men has crossed Roger's neck, the audience is excited.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford Bridge has been returning a regular group of activists who reconstructed the fate night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder yet.
“It is strange that in all these years one person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; although we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the event reconstruction.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to conduct. Each community of Monroe reminds us that justice was not done enough.
"We require judicial prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but more importantly, justice," Brooks said.
"Until then, a process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The doctor covers on July 27, 1946, one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's files to the NBC News, 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were to attend lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted so far.
Although suspects remain free for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the people of the city.
In April 1946, the inhabitants of Georgia received the right to participate for the first time in the elections planned for the summer, based on the decision of the Supreme Court.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer was supposed to stab the owner of the land in the white skin of Barnett Hester, allegedly due to his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester had been living with Malcom Dorothy's wife and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the most important owner of Loy Harrison's white land for Malcom's bail of $600.
It was accompanied by Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from the prison, just before they entered the Moore's Ford Bridge, they were replaced by a group of suspects.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," she excites the FBI.
“It is also obvious that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers, who were not only involved in lynching, but also to rid themselves of evidence and to conceal the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks spoke more briefly about the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for electoral law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black skins: "If you register and go to vote."
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Its performance is obvious, reassuring and robust. It shows a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider in modern America as being destroyed.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it's even more difficult to reverse your eyes, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so, we must face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us,” Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship if you don't listen to what I had to go through."
The main exams of this year's reconstruction began in June and the first day about 30 actors - dozens of whites, the rest of the black - recorded in the room where Greene introduced them with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is in charge of his assistant director.
For many years, the leader of Kukluxklan played, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it, because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaught.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time."
Hercs Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, also Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The presentation begins with a fight - Malcom concurs with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n--e!"
I can't get Rascon.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (or every actor in black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What's happened?" he's turning out to be Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," will hang Greene's smile.
"Only I don't think white people used to call it "n-r's tone."
"Excellently," says one of the actors of the black skin.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of getting closer.
Everyone wants the show authentic, just to be done behind enough four victims of massacre.
The actors of the scene are repeating.
Rascona puts emphasis on the correct word word to N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The presentation ends violently and quickly.
River, gunshots... and silences.
A woman dressed in black standing above the bodies of actors and is a sad song by Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word in the room, it feels sad.
In the background of all this, about a dozen sightings are running out of sweat and tears from the eyes.
In the community there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came all the way from New York Ithaca, many looking around.
Each of them endures local wet climates almost eight hours, and Brooks is at the crowd leading them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this moment, murder may have been viewed by a distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
In the last words of the song, Greene's crowd calls for body inspection.
The kids are knocking at the head of the victim, watching false blood and the non-stop bodies and whispering something into the ear.
"They're not dead," they're losing a little boy.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and stare at tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaught, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon will cover his two friends-herce and cry in their arms; finally, emotions catch him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know that the roles are troubling for you.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience is sitting together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about the black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feeling from today's show.
"It's difficult to listen to these ugly words and look at the disgusting works... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to reconstruct.
“It’s not for me to realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic,” she added, “the only one called it police fights.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows, it could happen again.
People who don't know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree. On the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where instructions for using anything was rather a rational statement.
So, for example, my first turntable contained only one paper that had hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, there were some secret marks on everyone.
After years, when something went wrong inside, I offered the Shaman leaf that wasn't going to blow out the back board.
He told me with a gloat what the other paper with the mercenary is suitable for.
Yes, it was a custom aid for chronic toilet paper depleting.
He found a broken wire and enabled me to listen to expensive vinyl cookies again.
A new time brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where just stuck to the overcircumcised grep, required about ten images.
Especially led was a sketch with a description of how to move one part into another.
The consultation was two-way and another procedure just couldn't be done.
To give it the opposite required considerable efforts with the necessity to remove certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-lock.
The 2003 production year had a book with a manual for minor repairs, among other things it included the change of the blinkru bulb.
It was simple.
A total of three steps, and the work was supposed to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions failed to mention that while the bulb on the right went to exchange really only in three steps.
First, remove the cover.
2. Blow out a broken light bulb and screw up a new one.
3. string the cover.
The left-handed bulb had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought, by moving the right upper limb into the car work, I covered some springs, screws, and then I'd be able to handle points 1-3 of the savings book author.
I think it's the bottle.
The cover had no place, no space, no sleazy hand, no other obese Slezana.
I've lost half my life, and it's completely without any success.
The state was still forced by my wife's entry into the garage, which brought up the knight and the words that she heard very specially from my mouth.
"What are you doing here?" she said, "I don't know what you're doing."
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"Why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last.
I briefly explained the problem, and I put the main emphasis on the process of torture the author of the instruction, where weeding with a burning iron on her hand, which she wrote, and then to try to get her to write nothing again, was simply an introduction to the wide range of instructions Kladiva on the witch, including his commissary burn on the top of the Losin Castle.
"How about putting the box away?" said the woman about putting the battery down.
In clear desperation it occurred and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought there was nothing to surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called, who was just talking about collapsing after having checked two of the presidents of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague, who has experienced impossible in the field, and who can also interpret wild stories with an uninterrupted voice.
"Throw that I have received a fine for not being given instructions for washing my hands," he said to me with a weak voice.
I gradually pulled the whole problem out of him in that he didn't have any picture instructions to wash his hands over the sink on the patient's toilet.
His argument with the Commission's office that adults usually know how to wash their hands, and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people, had no hounding effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simple wash-out of washed palms running water is a primitive action at the level of cromonon, that man modern, home sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that it is necessary to let go of the tap of water.
The whole process has 11 points, but at the end there's a joyous discovery that a person washed his hands just as it orders him a hosud from the SÚKL.
Finally, I must point out that I've been inspired and prepared a detailed action plan for the toilet.
On the issue of defection, the procedure is uniform, there is no problem, urination, due to a certain difference in both sexes, two instructions will need to be posted.
The problem is that these icons remain, because creating a perfect procedure means even the exact picture of all the anatomic details, which could be aroused by a prude visitor of a certain indignant toilet, the fact that he can finally learn that he has cut off the right hole in a very wrong manner throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in order to bring business back.
The British Education Group, Pearson, said on Friday, that they would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another discharge wave, which, according to John Fallon’s Executive Director, will be released at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees under previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to increase the declining trade due to the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that this year's outlook remained unchanged after it announced a 1 % increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul, and in the attack one NATO soldier died, and several others were injured, the official authorities put in place.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, says NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in Qarabagh city district.
This month, Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday at an explosion in the Heratian Mosque.
He killed suicide on Monday, two people near Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday’s explosion occurred after a patrol with the members of the Afghan army was attacked by “local person with a flyer made by an explosive device”.
The statement also states that all soldiers' injuries are out of danger of life and are found in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagrám Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteur, the growing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in the nearby Bagrám.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb was killed in a car of at least 30 people in Shia's Kabul district.
The Taliban entered the attack.
On 31 May, he killed a large explosion in the city center of more than 150 people. This is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S. troops have thrown down the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence undermines the already doubtful situation in Afghanistan and US President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteur, suicide attacks have opened up to the public in recent weeks' confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in President Ashraf Ghanín's reputation.
The EPA re-evaluated its decision on the withdrawal of smoking rules in response to the action
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone Obama administration law, which directed States to reduce emissions, only the day after 15 countries were sued by the Agency.
The EPA announced in Wednesday nights its decision to transfer ‘Ozone Standards 2015’ in the words that it submits the Agency's commitment to co-operation with the States.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and hear their views,” said Director EPA Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced an attempt to delay the ozone standards - which measure the actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed an action on Tuesday, arguing that EPA's illegal.
President Trumpa's administrator is seeking to avoid many environmental regulations designed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an attempt to undermine economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have begun countermeasures on the part of the Democrats and conservative groups concerned with the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that air breathing with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got shot and the blood flowed!
This, with us a rather new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this unfamiliar singer has arranged for the Czech condition of a monstrous event, where he has hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and many others, and no one else has been successful in the event but Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, show up to the public and introduce his music video to Sara's song, whose baptism was made up of the named personality.
However, few people already know that the filming itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big filming with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go without a proper troupe.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singers' video had an indication of the punch of the story.
However, at one point, he hit him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to treat the doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, I immediately got blood out of my nose," said Ladislav of the situation.
Colleagues and producers said it was an unfortunate coincidence, and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation of the next production.
We are bringing you a video video of a young artist, and you can also record the scene with a punch.
The unscheduled version of blood, but was not more likely to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibility of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could incentivise the most fast boxing match in light weight, met for the first time on Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the unharmed champion in the light scales of World Boxing Council - came not down to the hall, where Lomachenko welcomed, the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory based on a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in easy weight.
Garcia drew his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends on Saturday at 19:00h his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm the former champion in the dickweight," Garcia adds.
"I had to bring up for a fight with Broner (67 kg) but I'm not that big.
I'm 63 pounds small.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
Lomachchenko has to move again to get lightly... then we can run away.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't you do it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The Box would benefit this game."
Klimas made a request to pay for sightings - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should take his debut in light weight at the end of this year and meet with Garcia next year (37-0, 30 knockots) who also expressed interest in the match against the duel of Jorge Lineres vs. Luke Campbell, who will meet on 23 September for a title in the forum's lightweight.
“The stock should run through the way the payments were made for views,” said Garcia, who later expressed the opportunity to send the game through the television station, which would come with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomanchenko as a “climb boxer” and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn't give Garcia's praise to enjoy it when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're thinking about a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said that they felt a rising tension in front of a mutual duel.
"You're not just gonna forget about this game.
No other game is paying attention.
And I, with great comfort, put it into the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple of 12 years ago, he disappeared without a trace.
They just found their car at the bottom of Volhy.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police finally stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, it was a sad end to the whole story.
The wreck of their car found a lay diver on the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of Cheboxara in Čuvaska.
Only thanks to the evidence left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade under water without the police taking much longer to detect the identity of the people found.
The couple were last spotted when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver that discovered the car has yet to remain anonymous.
He reported his finding to the Cheboxaran police who pulled the car out to the beach the following day.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused the road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to establish age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers test in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been asked as early as 18 years, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish medical agency (RÃttsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to better assess applicants in the framework of evaluating asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failure to determine the age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid- March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as an age of 18, while in the next 25 cases, the forensic medical agency considered that the question was ‘ maybe older than 18 years’.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the question was ‘ maybe less than 18 years’.
The test shall only be conducted if the age of the contested person is disputed.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson, the results of the forensic medical agency correspond with the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, statistics are held in busy tracks and numbers are very similar," said The Local.
The higher number of candidates whose age has been estimated at the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that ‘the person concerned is 18 years old or older’.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 cases published and found that in 243 cases the contested said it would be 18 years old.
The criteria have also been followed by a medical method of determining the age, which includes wisdom teeth xengen and mRI skin joints, which subsequently assess dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological matureness of people to determine the age when the concerned went through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue, and I do not think that these measurements to assess the age are right.
The assessment of a biological age is very uncertain in a sense.
If we cannot determine age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise," said Metro.
The forensic medical agency Agent's GÃ¶ransson argued: “It is currently possible to say that the risk of wrong assessment of the child as an adult is small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the person in question is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all the questions asked."
Trump threatened Mexican president on the phone.
American President Donald Trump in January's telephone to Mexican President Enrique Peno-Neta threatened him not to meet with him unless he publicly says his country won't pay for building a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that the financing would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted he would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the transcripts of interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made a wall construction at the southern border for the Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first interview with the Mexican President shortly after taking up the function of Trump Penou Neta's nediplomatics for building the wall.
He clipped the South neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed on the Mexican president so he didn't publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," said Trump repeatedly in an interview from January 27 and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a relentless statement.
I hear the funding's gonna come up with something, and it's gonna end up all right.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you guys anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American daily.
The wall has identified the least important thing we're talking about, but it may be politicalally the most important thing.
Effective order to build the wall of Trump released shortly after power was taken.
Mexico’s construction and construction of walls with a length of 3200 kilometres refused, and the relations between the two countries also failed.
By the end of March Trump said that the project will be paying the United States so far.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the June G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To such a conclusion, it allowed him to exchange views on an agreement whereby Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the fact that the United States will adopt persons from international facilities in the Pacific Islands.
Trump first considered the deal as a fool, but later he joined her.
"You can say that this is not an agreement you have created, but you will have to hold on to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone interview with Turnbull was almost lovable, for example when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees coming in boats.
"You're worse than me," said Trump.
But suddenly, this conversation got high.
"I hate to accept these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who go to work for local milk," he said.
He also noted in his interview that a fugitive could become a Bostonent in five years' time.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after arriving in the White House, phone talks with a number of world states, often several times.
The talk with Turnbull finally referred to as the least pleasant in the whole day.
Before he terminated, he pointed out that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the killer Rany before the crowd.
She also looked at her father.
The execution took place at the square in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi has chosen for his sacrifice the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took him to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he then dumped near the Mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit the whole country that is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was standing in the first row of a thousand - head crowd gathered to become a witness to the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi has been sentenced under the law of the charm.
The victim's father gave the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
And the other family members were present, and together with the crowd, they shouted the password "to live justice."
A gunman in the square brought a police van from which he was removed.
The cops tied him up on his stomach.
One of his members turned his gun against him and immediately launched fire.
The present crowd was celebrating every blow that was fired.
Mr almatari told the web MailOnline that justice was executed in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah, and the law of Sharia have won," he added.
I stood on the Square of the liberation in Sana waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice was accomplished.
The police were afraid that a crowd gathered in the square would fall through the hateful madness, the killer would fall and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of Shiite Hútí.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 punches after arrest, but his act had aroused such humiliation that the judge had decided for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Ran's family knew him well.
When the police searched his house's basement, she discovered evidence that a man planned his action.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rano.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that ran Ranino's body was terrible," he told the media.
"The Roan disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, and we told it to the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
A girl's mother, Jamile, must have been hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to play out with other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The inhabitants of Yemen were dishonored of crime and began to gather before the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
Deputy Justice Department read the investigation log to the present crowd to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show regret over his actions.
Just before he was punished, the police read him a verdict, but the defendant only looked at his executioner for the flight.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many records available on the Internet that the crowd ordered.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced at the meeting of President Trumpa on Thursday night that he would go to another party.
“You like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me,” said Governor of Justice.
"This day after long prayer and thought, I am telling you... today as residents of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The ascension of the sightings has exploded in joy.
"I will report to the Republicans tomorrow," says Justice.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised the people at a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only millionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited great property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: “The running of Governor Justice is another morning for the democratic party that puts obstacles in our way rather than making reasons for the lifting of our country."
“For a democratic party with only 15 governors and controls at least the law enforcement authorities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last drop for an already established party without a leader who has no interest in finding a positive and unifying report,” said President Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's “direct” apology for the doping scandal
Former excellent sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated again that it had not yet come true time for Russia to return to the sporting world.
The head of the Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the MS in the athlete - that the extermination of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who have lost gold and silver medals. ”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think today we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised to hear Russia admits its mistake and works from all forces to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said that he was also “blessed” that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have proceeded to a further degree, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the penalty that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“We need to do everything we can to stabilise the situation in the coming months.
Our effort was always to separate honest athletes from those unreserved," he concluded his speech.
At the MS at the athlete, which starts on Friday in London, will compete under neutral flag 19 Russian athletes who have fulfilled the strict rules of IAAF.
IAAF Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being released back.
Drug presence tests are still inconvenient and the exclusion of trainers continues to operate, told the reporters in London after the IAAF Council was completed.
The CzechTrade state contract has been awarded by František Savov, whose state is undermining.
The public contract of the CzechTrade State Export Agency has been awarded the publishership of the Young Front of František Savov.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that Savaov was being prosecuted by the Czech state for tax fraud and asked for his edition to the Czech Republic.
Proport agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade has published a public contract in April for four years providing editorial content for BusinessInfo portal.
A contract worth CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishers of the Young Front of the businessman František Savaov.
In 2014, the Czech police charged him with tax evasion, and he ran away.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic asks for his release.
The case alerted the server currently.cz.
The award of the contract was based on the original criteria of CzechTraade to decide of 60 percent of the price offered and of the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
At the same time, Savov’s company helped the second criterion significantly.
According to Dotik.cz, she received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
This was the result of moving her to another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a sum of 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Fronts, however, it has gained 62 points from the reviewers in all qualitative criteria for the sub-species.
Tendru was also attended by the consultant BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which looks just like the server News.cz under the publication of Economics.
VLM's publishers objected several concerns against the outcome of the tendon that its evaluation considers it unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it decided to challenge the Competition Office of the ÚOHS.
It is believed that the CzechTrade proceeded against the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract supplier on the basis of a fair subjective assessment, clearly a favoring participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and of other suppliers," writes in the proposal to initiate the procedure given at the ÚOHS this week, which published the server currently.
According to the Director-General and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klímy, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be unfaithful and 100% evaluation of the project Young Fronts for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," said Klíma.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed its view on the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not basically comment on public contracts before closing them.
All information about you covered by the contract is published in the Customer Profile and in the Public Contract Holder.
"After completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the contract period we cannot comment on it," said Dotik.cz media representative of the agency Štěpán Long.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publishers of Economics had hit the article in News.cz in a competition where they had their own business interests.
However, that fact has been stated in that Article.
In the tendru she could have helped by providing a BusinessInfo editorial service in the previous four years.
The contract first took place in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Cuba ODS.
Frantisek Savova blames the tax evasion police in connection with the excessive deductions of VAT to its companies, which caused the Czech state to damage up to CZK 770 million.
Czech Republic has been asking the Great Britain to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO Andrej Babiš movement, under whose influence the publishers of Mafra, stands.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov's appeal against the issue, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, from Great Britain we have received no understanding of the judgment until today," said Štěpánek Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Attorney.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Fronts, Savov was established in Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech-duch Brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing a threatened asset.
It should also control the failing Heavy Machinery Services, previously the Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Saviov was associated with the acquisition of assets from the former Socialist Society of Youth.
The biker was driving through the sidewalks and the park, and he ended up in the boilers.
The biker drew attention to himself by taking a careless ride across the streets, pavements and parking trails in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to run it in the direction of Stanstě.
"The policemen of men followed the city with caution when, on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně, he failed to drive and he entered the area with the motorcycle, where he crashed," said Police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, the rescue helicopter, who was transporting the injured biker to the Plzeň hospital, had to come to the accident.
Later, the police found that the motorcycle's own driving licence, the motorcycle registration marks were stolen, its production number was removed and the production label itself was removed.
It's so possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is another investigation.
"The breath test carried out was excluded at the site of the presence of alcohol in the driver, but a positive result was found on the metamphetamine substance," said the police spokesperson.
How financial rules of football affect the movement of Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in prestigious Lize champions.
The rules of fair play (FFP) that the UEFA introduced in 2011 indicate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without much loss.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neymara out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary in the sum of several decades of millions of dollars per year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Catholic family, which has richer for the sale of energy, it can afford to bring Neymara into such a star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on purchasing players, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate legal revenue sources, which allows them to cover the direct costs of football-related business activities.
FFP led Michel Platini to the seat of UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who are in pursuit of new reinforcements owe themselves, ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to arrange them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and to spend hot sums for players y to build a global brand - suddenly it was not so beneficial.
In the context of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may make a loss up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Czeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive loss.
"FFP rules are still valid and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, which is supervised by compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-off payment, the amount may, for accounting purposes, spread over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million annually for a period of five years.
In 2014, PSG and Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi Group, hit the first wave of the highest sanctions.
PSG had a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the League Champions' League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is careful of teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through a club owner company.
Therefore, even if the Cataran company sponsors PSG, once funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, the UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
In 2014, after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority was too high, UEFA joined similar measures.
Part of Neymar’s revenue in PSG could be paid from the MS organizational commission in football 2022 in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and MS 2022 representatives in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become an MS ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday, UEFA has not initiated any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, as it is not entitled to comment with PSG, stated The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542,4 million in turnover.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of dressings.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The leaders of the Spanish League, apparently concerned with leaving one of the greatest stars, sought to freeze Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break the rules of the FFP.
“It is a clear case of “financial doping” club and state,” said President la Liga Javier Tea for Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG’s Catalan Syndicate.
Manager Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares the same attitude La League on financing the club.
“This is the result of ownership that has changed the football world since the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of fair play is very difficult because the State can have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan backup Russian: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand aploying fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as in Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan backup man was moving against the Crvene Zhronda game, devised several gloats, but his teammates didn't lock in black.
The airline team pumped with new multimillion reinforcements, so after the inception of doubles in European cups, ends.
Was there anything else difficult to do after the Bělehrad goal?
After the incased goal it was necessary to shoot four, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, raise our confidence, so we'd have a lot to go to next game.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is so worked out.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we fired in half the time, maybe once.
Of course, that is very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents more often into these positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new man is formed.
We've only played three competitions and the lineup is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11-year-old to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you have already played part of two matches after each other?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to develop, and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same thing as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came back in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
Once again, there was a wonderful visit, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Show me something for which they'll come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember that kind of visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a cupless season be at least an advantage to the league?
For the time being we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not the advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman is supposed to sit down for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint by the businessman Jiří Toman, who is supposed to have a major tax cut to the extent of serving ten years in prison.
The resulting damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman in the complaint claimed that justice infringed its fundamental rights, the effective findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges referred to the complaint as unfounded, found the CTK from the Court database.
U.S. is not another appeal court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, judge the facts or legal doubts which allegedly have been committed by general courts, if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," is in the resolution.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
Verdict has been competent since November 2015, when he was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in the discharge custody of Argentina, where he was also at the time of the decision of the U.S.
The penalty imposed is at the top of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Court of First Instance held that the case was an extreme tax evasion which had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man acted as Chairman of World Service Board between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the total escape according to the expert exceeded the billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the complainant, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of the monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, the tax in just hundreds of thousands was paid.
The World Servis and some of the companies with whom the company was trading have a relationship with the business of Radomír Chosen, who was responsible for the VAT machine for trade in fuel materials for 13 years in prison.
He also refused his complaint before the time of the Constitutional Court.
The "Léto To Insurrection" and "Comrade Detective" series play on the nostalgic string
This story is nostalgic for both characters of the famous 1980s; and for dirty 1990s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter put the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV; and of course also for modern times, namely, 2001, than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd started to develop to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also an epithelial of our modern facebook eras of permanent memories.
Well, it looks like someone's breathing' from a frantic point of view.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to absurd humor (for example, there can be a story about the creation of a talking can with vegetables that H. Jon Benjamin said).
The authors turned away from the main funny points - middle-aged actors who play teen horny children - and they couldn't pull them off from previous events.
The continuation of “This Years Later” in which adults are playing adults do not push so much on emotional plane and satire is very sporadic, including parody for thrillers from the 1990’s as the “Ruka on the collage”.
At one point, the character will find on a pile of Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and "pull of other 1991 things".
Many major stories are repeated.
Dobrostrečný Coop (Mr Showalter), now the writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), which is stimulated by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many other stories are the best part of the French.
It is especially fun to watch young Rudd forever with long hair alias the character Matt Dillon from the movie Young, who once respected Andy's character is now behind the old paprik.
The French could start the moments of random madness, such as the strongest series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the whole group will be released at the premiere "Léta do not survive".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War of the series "such as normal Americans", the film "Atomical Blond: Without regret" and even the program "GLOW" in which the icons of Eastern and Western Wrestling scenes meet.
Brian Gatewood's comedians' comedians and Hansandra Tanaka in Rhys Thomas's directorship to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s, fighting for truth and atheism after Marxism-Lenism.
The main roles are the Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which have been converted to the English language Channing Tatum (actual producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cop watching chess on TV, parody on American football).
The series has rented its voice to many known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is focused too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes also the killer with the Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too angry and comedy moments is not enough.
In shorter footage, the propaganda satire in the “Comrade Detective” could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in which two fatmen glide burgers put together.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The ideas of Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes didn't wait for the IAAF to cancel.
The International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian racers due to a state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the world championship, which starts on Friday, came as expected very clearly.
There were 166 delegates in favour of extending the ban, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is that Russia is unable to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the Head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have yet to be heard, and there are still trainers working in the country with a shattered reputation.
Even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA is not fully operational yet, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-doping Agency.
RUSADA may, however, be testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
Russian athlete federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost last year's Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro.
Despite the ban of the upcoming MS, 19 Russians, who have previously proven themselves to have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for longer periods.
However, they will not be able to start in national colours and if they win, they will not be able to play a Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will hold a interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following an inconspicuous economic growth and a weakening inflation that has sufficiencyd the speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background” in connection with the maintenance of interest rates - despite the desire of family budgets.
The policy-makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of England voted six to two for the maintenance of the interest rate of 0,25%. The results of the vote on the interest rate increase supported unsustainable economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecast growth to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that, over the next few years, inflation due to Brexite inflation should increase, and it also indicated that the mosality rental should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
They also voted in favour of downloading parts of the mammothed package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was introduced to practice a year ago as an answer to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the plan should start from next February, offering cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has said that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: “MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (HDP) will, in short term, stagnate together with a pressure on real household income and consumption burden.”
On the issue of the bank’s tariffs, it stated that it would be necessary to ‘take cash policy belts’ to calm inflation, in addition to the markets they expect.
Markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the Bank pointed out that any increase would be "free" and "restricted".
The Bank decreased its growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1,7 % as predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 was 1,8 % unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound decreased against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain the status of the present has come after a more disappointing increase has buried the hope of further growth - GDP has stopped to 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0,2 % of the previous three months.
The increase is very likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter, although it should be slightly increased by the end of the year.
The latest message on inflation is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report further states that the monetary policy "can't prevent" the reduction of revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also increase due to great interest in British goods thanks to weak libra, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came after the rate was reduced to 0,025 % in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, leading to a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and economies will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many requested a rise in the rates together with rising inflation, which has created a growing pressure on the household, and three political agents requested an increase of 0.5% in June.
The inflation decreased back to 2.6% from June 2.9%, even though the bank claimed that such a change had been expected and inflation should rise over the next month.
The Bank claimed that the overrun of the target was ‘total’ as a result of weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “With regard to the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those to which the existing contracts and mortgages are concluded - there are options free of charge as well as the low rates they receive on the counter."
NHS prescribes an controversial HIV medicine of 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access from September to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) pill, which is used before sex, reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 percent, will be offered through healthcare to approximately 10,000 patients during the three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court of last year, expressing that NHS had funds to pay PEP despite the statement that the drug should finance local authorities.
The decision that was announced on Thursday was taken by the NHS of England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’ while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘declaring moment’.
The sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Further clinics will join in October and complete implementation will take place until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an HIV medicine used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV between patients at risk.
The application of PEP before sex means that the patient’s body has a sufficient amount of specific medicines to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexuals or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive people who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall designate eligible participants who have accepted participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in Great Britain can also log in in in their local sex health clinic and discuss potential participation in testing.
The program comes to taxpayers for £10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution agreement this week after obtaining an international contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and to assess the full potential of the PEP, its strength, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and make full use of constantly expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
He's another milestone in more than 30 years trying to stop one of the greatest challenges in human health.'
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer an opportunity to transform the HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients exposed to the high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to talk to a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Executive Director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘The usual number one must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure that it is accessible to every patient.
We now have a PreEP test and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PEP test period is welcome and long awaited by change after months of delay and detention by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transfer of this life-threatening infection.
Following tests will lead us to a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and, together, put an end to the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on a high leg: Interpatro and smart design have turned this small apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leighová, former banker with passion for real estate, replaced a large house in Knightsbridge for apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an opinionable demonstration of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
“I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same height of ceiling.
I fell in love with him right now, and that same day I was knocking on him."
Since then, the apartment has been through a size of 1000 square meters of complete renovation.
One room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - you wanted Joanne to add a detour space and intertwine to use a high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
That was my request," she said.
To this end, Erfana Azadi employed from the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights so that there would be two gaps — the challenge for architects, so it was to create an intermediate on which to walk inward.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
“The total construction is complicated,” he explained.
“We had both had to organize the premises so that we could walk uprightly.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend steel construction so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full rooms on each other - and at the same time add to dramaticity.
In the meantime, he looks at the wonderful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the dramaticity, space and lighting.
A short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror railing in the kitchen looks like a window in the next room.
On the front door are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store items and greenhouses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a much larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Glass kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a slide door.
"We had to resolve the technical side," Erfan says about the stiffed doorways.
"The door is equipped with anti-seriousness to address itself very easily."
Due to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne received another 16 square meters, second room and better total layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you sell is a living area - or an award of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate broker essentially calculates its price on the basis of the living area at the entrance to the apartment.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that lend a luxury look to space.
“Material is very important because you touch him and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power distribution in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts won't get it."
As it turns out, quality design and increased living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is running.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travelling its citizens to Tennessee State and other seven states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retaliatory ban on travelling its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense that citizens of the United States can travel freely after all 50 states.
It is the fact that California has forbidden state money to spend on the journeys of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any statement of opposition to the LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law on the subject of conscience, according to which a psychotherapet, which has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients, has no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with other therapists who do not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws, according to which religious charities, which, from mothers, received children from birth to adoption, do not have to give these children their adoption to the same sexes.
Because of these laws, California has prohibited the financing of its citizens' travels to eight countries from its means.
In practice, this means that California’s professors must not have a way to a scientific symposia, for example, in Texas, to be paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
On the way, they must obtain either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travels of citizens from State A to State B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has come to be patient and its Parliament has adopted a law with resolutions that it also does not like California's policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerances for illegal immigrants, but still does not apply to California because of this embargo.
He treats them as a retribution for California's embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to each state of the Union, who would order travel for any reason to another country.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is anti-stoppable.
States have the right to adopt laws on the subject of conscience as well as to decide what their money will go and what they can't.
Second of all, what's wrong with your conscience?
If the butcher had a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him under penalty to sell pork when butchers offering pork is enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to make a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to take cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes for hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can have internal, domestic policy within the powers that are not federal, to adjust according to their preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, the members of the LGBT once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many of the members of this community are governed by the rule of life, and let them live, to which all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek not to tolerate themselves and others, but to be extreme intolerant to others.
No one should ever express any moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle anymore, and if this is the case, it is to be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern-day enemies of freedom.
In fifth, I don't know the situation in American history, where states have, for political reasons, had this kind of purpose in addition to a single case.
Even during the time of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and South on the side of the Segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery and was set to war in the North against South.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally dissolving.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin's got a oil fine.
Russian opposition policy Alexej Navalnyi received a fine of 300,000 rubles for breaking the rules of the campaign before the presidential election next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the past two months, Navalny organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wanted to be the head of the state in March next year.
The President-in-Office of Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but is generally expected to do so and will win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and brought him to court.
He gave him a fine for calling people to demonstrations through videos located on YouTube's web portal.
Pokuta is three hundred thousand.
"We'd better pull them off the salary of the judge," he joking on the twitter of the critic Kremlin.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalnyi cannot take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered to be an anti-corruption fighter, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
The executions of 300,000 rubles, and the 25 thousand rubles of the court of Thursday also imposed on two members of the Navalní prelection team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskinn.
Navalj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality on a broken opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalna in the campaign in all ways.
In February he was sentenced to a five-year-old penalty because he robbed Kirovles' forestry company.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so competent, which, according to the Russian law, prevents running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over 500 million dollars
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the Empire of their Italian family, drag about one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over 500 million dollars.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in the Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who made a dispute about common property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being held before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna owns 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, the first store bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family of Westco Jeans was founded, which grew into the chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the entire family sold $85 million to the entire company.
For money, other properties and portfolios of De Lutis now include offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who according to Paul’s words, is “a significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The Court states that Colin owns a $316 million property, while Paul manages real estate for $176 million.
Paul's problem has just become the distribution of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal was very important in my eyes,” wrote Paul in a court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business – Paul’s comments of Colin were cut off by.
Colin resists the fact that it's not true and blames Paul for wrong dealing with some properties.
In the previous reference statement, Colin said that he believed in the obvious resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates that family is most important,” he wrote.
The cost of court proceedings is rising. Hundreds of pages of page reference declarations, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and both parties' lawyers.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who had been running milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s, and in the 1970s they bought a mall in Brunswick.
With the money gained by stopping the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family company with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco, “the last year of college, Paul was still young, about a 10-year-old. ”
Anna De Lutis stated that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would take place after good.
“Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was indemnified by the amount of $10 million and Luke in the amount of $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, "they would not be satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation".
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he's a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL, as he said in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin through the text message in which he stated that, given that the dispute is dealt with in court, "I have nothing to add."
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole case in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in the court of Colin, he tried to adapt to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would be very disgruntled if he saw our current situation," he said, "he said, "he was hoping for a tough solution."
I don't see all the hopes on Friday.
“Our disputes will be resolved in the short time of trial,” Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers are blowing up both water and summer clothes.
In parent school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now present, he only goes out in the morning.
The school is after the reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide great shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classes where they are aging a blind and covered curtains.
Air is trying to cool the air cleaners because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for parent schools, so we should not actually have an open operation at this time," said the principal of the school of Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten where she thinks the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We blow up after 6 o'clock in the morning, the windows shut down, and we have a blind on the south side of the wall that we protect ourselves.
"But it won't help," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest kindergarten in Hrázice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful peanut there, there's a table below it, and there we do things," she described the head of Barbora Koman's kindergarten.
Teachers and children are trying to walk into the woods where there's more cold.
The children of wet hats and the programs have different games with water.
"We have a hand-to-hand pressure sprayer, which is used for flower sprays, and we use it for showering children," the Companian said.
Also headmistress in Novoborská street on Jitka Vilmovská Proseku, Prague, said that the teachers of children try to keep the shadows and drops them with water.
"We have a relatively growing garden, so they're under trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every kid has to have a head cover.
Teachers also remind their children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a few sweeted teas or diluted juices and in the garden have pins with water.
Every day, they also have fresh fruit and vegetables for eating vegetables and snacks, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"The third mother here today brought about a ten-year-old melon for the children," said Makačková.
Drivers get water or summer uniform.
The Prague DPP provides them with water in hot days, ion drinks or summer uniforms.
The bus cabs also trams are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP Aneta Říhková.
In addition to cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger space.
The high-temperature tramways haven't really damaged much yet.
There was little damage in the Hostvar loop.
At current high temperatures, we ensure that drivers have enough drinks available.
"The cool drinking water is available in all loops, changing points and roads," said Řehková.
In cars and in some conversion places, employees have so-called sodours, which produce a chilled soda.
Drivers also get soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," said the spokesperson.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firemen in the Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday through the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsia, the firemen employed mainly to fight fire.
"They considered fires in the natural environment as well as those associated with the harvest work," said the spokesperson of Nicole Zaoral.
The relief to the firemen did not bring any evening weather change, with the heat on a number of places kept storms and flooding down.
In connection with storms, firemen went to 236 hits.
It was especially about the removal of burnt trees and branches.
"The most affected in the Mediterranean region," Zaoral continues.
The firemen’s help, however, was also needed at Stoznka in Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from the children’s camp because of storms.
The tropical temperatures have also made the work of the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances drove to ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning with penalty.
That's why people should check their water heaters, warn paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas free of smell, which is released in imperfect combustion.
The symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, an infected room must be left.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Many tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
The Politico portal said that the new Chief of Staff in the White House is planning to limit the flow of information from President Trumpa - including reports on television news - in the hope of keeping Trumpa high.
Here's a part of the report to Josh Dawsey:
“When the new chief of White House John F. Kelly met the first day in a new position with employees, he drew the key issue of Trump’s White House, which intends to correct: the incorrect information that becomes the president’s hands.
Kelly has announced to employees that he must personally approve all information - whether on paper or speech - because the President can decide better on the basis of correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors broke teeth on Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back for decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV messages is even stronger.
“If Trump was distraught as a candidate by honest reports, it was convenient to show him that he spoke about him in positive light of a lot of other media that was easier to convince,” said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign adviser.
Tara Palmer, at that time, wrote from the Politico portal, that “a place for the maintenance of Trump’s tweets on sight - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly follow the media that sing praise for him. ”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter has ever been “in control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more stimulating if they weren't checked.
We'll never know about the tweets Trump sent out.
If his staff managed to keep him at least several times in check, then their efforts did not come out.
However, no one has yet been able to stop Trump from encouraging controversial issues on a regular basis.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving on the Trumps' materials - which they can, but may not be reliable - supporting their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit doubtful information to the Head of State in May.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's reporter's pen:
“The current and former Trumpa officials claim that the President often responds very angryly to the negative media reports, especially to the release of information, and seeks to find their origin.
This was the case at the end of February when someone planted a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of provocative Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy chief of staff of Katie Walsh from being “sourced by many leaks of information” from the White House.
No matter what, Johnson was always out of Twitter for harassment; or because he did not give his claim any evidence; or that he had already made false accusations in the past and later called them off.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “ tried to implement the system for the administration and documentation of information that President Trump would receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later trying to enforce the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just run out and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission are definitely making it worse.
Tourists are negotiating the moat and returning to the "Million Quarter"
Several of the most popular owners of home in the English county of West Midland are once again allowed to cross with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to regain the field for their residence.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in the city of Solihull, called the “millionaire quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and army of caravans, tourists return after they were declared in May. They did not pull out a ditch that was dug up on the spot under the authorities' orders in order to prevent their invasion.
Such a group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with an unprotected gap that served for the journey.
The city council of Solihull attacked the city’s city’s city’s city’s population with the fact that it was not able to solve the problem.
One of the people who wished to stay anonymously said: ‘They planted the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones after other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another place, and now they're back.
The others arrived last night, and I think there'll be more to it tonight.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham Board knows how to handle this problem. It uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't mean to pay any taxes until the board of directors deal with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, ‘It’s ridiculous, and we just watched the last of the driving tourists recently, and now they're back.
And this time, there are more, and this time they brought horses.'
Press spokesperson of Solihull City Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals report any non-communist or illegal conduct to the police at number 101.
We'll get the total picture we're going to present in court.'

Italians confirm in the fight against rescue ships of NG with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue NG vessels arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean, unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations," said the Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship of the Jugend RETT's German rescue organization due to suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly eases illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works for the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of an accusation by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"For us is and will always be the priority of one human life saving, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," said the organization in the Social Networks Declaration.
"All current charges can only be commented after the meeting of all information and the assessment of the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking Iuvent's Jugend Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspicious of the fact that she carried immigrants on the ship, who were handed them directly to human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place according to the applicant's file, only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and surrounding the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuvento to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last named organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any ‘essential change or obstacle’ in the case of rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct has, for example, rejected the organisation of doctors without frontiers (MSF) which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, which are located in Italy in the context of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen the patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bears fruit.
"We are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in recent days," said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the Mayors of Libya on the subject of economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali concerning measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Naughty Mesaroshe: From overalu came her silicone and cellulite.
The hot summer days are completely attracted to taking only the necessary ones to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaros is doing the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where it was actors, moderators, singers, and everyone who had anything to do with TV Prima, was just heming, and their bodies wrapped in a mini overall.
And only a couple of regular moves and a model showed everyone her sillies, but also her buttocks.
He turned over how many times he cut it in between half, plus he coughed up so high that she had to keep fixing it.
The attention of gentlemen and photographers present was definitely not necessary.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages in support of Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to release freedom in two years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
The twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will take 15 months from a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years in a conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father, on Thursday, in court, said: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision.
She had been threatened by freedom for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream shirts, Carter was standing on the spot when she declared a judgment with tears in the eyes, bound by hands and eyes headed toward the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the judge told the judge.
“ She finished his life to ease herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no regrets."
However, the lawyer Carter said that these were “unhappi circumstances which he deeply regrets”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “its age or level of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on her conduct”.
The applicant read Roy’s mother’s statement, Lynn Roy, saying: “It will not be one day that I will not grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and we will suffer the great pain we will carry with us forever," she said.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, testified that she was "prosecuted" by the fact that she would never participate in brother's wedding and be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of a person I have been seeing since I was born is the pain I bear for life,” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person who would help the suicide of another person, so this case is based on a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew attention to the whole nation after Carter's texts were published, which encouraged suicide.
"The two of you, jump out of the building or get stabbed, I don't care," wrote in the text messages Carter sent out just two weeks before he died when Roy was on his family vacation.
She wrote to him a few minutes before she was killed, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just need to set up a generator and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to abstain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who stood up to Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charges were dismissed.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi fixes up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Short day before Audi notice, BMW manufacturer stated that he would offer his customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of the BMW said that the company believes that there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions in response to European cities - including Munich, which is established by BMW - which consider the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would repair three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision as a download.
Europe's car manufacturers have promoted a large measure of the use of diesel atamombils in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide that releases diesel engines is considered carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automotive installations is increased to neutralize the gas produced by diesel engines, which makes the competitiveness of cars more difficult.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges against the dissecting of powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the Volkswagen errors, which in order to meet the emission limits installed in their cars software, which reduced the amount of emissions issued while testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were charged in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, a former head of thermodynamics would be arrested by the Department of Motor Development in Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to it extradition, so it can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi joined the criminal investigation of the German police in the case of Volkswagen's car after the authorities charged Audi with the installation of the system that was intended to cover European emission limits - and extended the charges faced by Audi in the US.
The inclusion of Audi's car into the investigation may have an unbleached impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is an disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profit.
Emergency plane landed on the beach.
A man and a little girl died.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in Costa da Caparica, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Notecias said that the plane before landing flew just over people on the beach who tanned.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from dangers to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50 - year - old man and an eight - year - old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them, and they were dead where they were," described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them came out of the accident alive, and the cops picked them up for questioning.
D11 or how to stop the highway.
And are there motorways in the Czech Republic even final?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's inexhaustible, even though it began to build in 1978.
Even if it's inexhaustible, it's fixed all the time.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a construction permit.
What is it?
Yes, Castle D11 motorway.
The construction of her next section for at least a few months stopped the Children's Earth movement.
We easters get highways after pieces, like when they're cutting through the halls.
They'll cut down the wheel and then they'll just see when and if we even get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get a truck going to Poland or Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the platoons are coming right through the city of Jaroměj or Náchod, which is not reasonable to evade.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, which is, before the incredible nine years.
Don't knock ever since.
That's why when the remaining four kilometres of an infinite section began to build to Hradec Králové recently, and at other sections to Jaroměj, archaeological research began with the fact that it would begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud swinging of pins in Eastern Bohemia.
No one ever believed it.
Last week, it turns out it won't be coming this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's movement of the Earth-Klub for sustainable transport from Brno was a decomposition.
The children of the Earth are repeating their tactics from D1.
They have assaulted decisions on construction permits in their entirety.
In the decomposition, they shall require a review of all already issued binding opinions by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hungarian Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Office.
So so far, we are leaving D11 near the village with an eloquent name Pohřibačka.
So we're going down, we're just going on a highway, and then we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to go back into the colon.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benecko, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their funeral.
What are the Children of Earth required?
What is the essence of construction problems in the Czech Republic?
And why is it virtually inviolable in the existing highway network?
You read in the new Reflex.
Provence Levandule threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of the Province of South-East France, but they are now at risk of climate change.
Levandules remain as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, which makes the eyes of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The development of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less precipitation in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
They also have cicadas and cobs carrying micro-bacterials, which are in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil they produce is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The town of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
Of course, the amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is smaller."
The possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and slowing the discharge of water from the soil, but also lavender sprays by a protective mixture of clay and water and cropping of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the Riodoce weekly meets regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots that are taking place in the Sinaloa area in the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and unscrupulous drug wars.
Today, however, it is mostly because of its own safety to support recent events.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked by a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to name each word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and premonition.
Collect them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal conduct.
The violence does not stand, and the bodies rise to a group across the country; journalists are constantly added between them: according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists there are at least 25 of President Enrique Pena's power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed in all seven countries this year.
Among them also co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His loss is surprising, although his presence is all-progressive - great photos of Valdez with the words “Justice” shown by the mediators, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - in the age of 30, have a T-shirt with photos of Valdez with a smile on their faces, glasses on his nose and hat Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although, in 2010, a special federal prosecutor was set up to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects have been sued by the Committee for the protection of journalists so far.
Most of the thousands of murders that take place every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
The Riodoce Newsists insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory at present is very treacherous.
Without information about the storms and without evidence of justice, a security meeting is unfamiliar, says Ibarr.
“It is foolish to waste time on such meetings,” adds.
"If we don't get more information, nobody can be trusted."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodace, Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to run several blocks when his red Toyota Coroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th river.
The shooters then got in his car and not far from the crime scene, crashed him.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
It seems that the rumors spread quickly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
From last year's arrest of Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country as the rival fraction tries to fill an empty site.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of two-story mausolei for the drug king, many of whom are larger than houses.
For a moment, the word “crossroads” believes that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that go to the United States of America with drugs.
Encourage this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, still indicting that he did not protect his friend.
She believes that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was a February interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The peace could have been angry with the sons; the suspects of the gang kicked all the copies of the newspaper at a time when they landed on their faces.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country because of his own safety, after having seized other newspapers in which the same story was left.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroeste's period he was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his shares worth $50 in 2003 and start with five Riodace colleagues.
In Sinaloe, “there was an impossible way to run a newspaper and not to mention a drug deal,” Bojorquez said.
In time Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true intelligence; the news began to work.
The reporters liked to go after the problem themes and published texts without censorship - readers encouraged to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for a report on Latin America.
Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Committee for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez admitted openly that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said when accepting the prices.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "life custom", said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take the role of a journalist or play a stupid one.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What were you doing face to face death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
Riodoce's employees miss Valdez. A man was known for his jokes and unincreasing language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hug - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone was relying on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the bar El Guayabo across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, has this routine caused his death?
His death also raised questions about her own assumptions - how to do her job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you come up with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
“These things were forbidden,” Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-inclusion.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like something's wrong, hands off.
The problem is, the editor Riodace Andres Villarreal said that “the eye is a sense that can be deceived... and then that thing happened with Javier.”
The old rules according to him, like others, in Sinaloae, are no longer valid - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states home to the toxic mix of lucrative smugglers, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones allowed in the room where Riodoce's employees meet; a spyware was discovered a few days ago, buying governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of a 40-degree helm in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-story building in the Culiacan city district.
The reporters are pulling off whether these police officers are 50 percent of the law defenders who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been a few months since journalists have last gone to mines that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three major stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of a former boxer Julia Caesar Chávez in Sinalo.
They also cover suspicious government expenditures that took place in the home town of the Governor of the State.
Recently, there were also several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious restaurants of Culiacan, just a block from the state representative's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is linked to a policy that is a member of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scene almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the former incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including the incident where one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzman escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly have taken the case,” said Villarreal (46), who is named “El Flaco” for his squeaky character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protests against the killing of journalists. The employees certainly didn't expect them to become activists in the representation of the press.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez dropped several signs and went out to demonstrate the next morning in front of the state's attorney's office because of other journalists.
El Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michigan.
Only a burned body has been discovered, the authorities say it's Adame's DNA analysis.
The activities of journalists are progressing across the country, many of them are organising protests and drawing on walkways and the "SOS press" buildings.
The head of Bojorquez newspaper is a day to visit Washington, where he tries to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who held the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and murdering them for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of fear that her anger might jeopardise her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "deathed" by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifference to the public.
In his last book “Narco-Journalis” he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels but also on the order of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all attacks on journalists and public officers.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Matías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a note that allegedly signed Zetas' cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages.”
There were keyboards and headphones lying around the head.
Some branches decided to end their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
The others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels article on the opening page called "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are being chased all the time.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who decided to stay and not give up their work, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits he's scaring him about drugs.
"Mexico is heading for hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday night and Riodoce's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly begins to ring.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war proceeds exactly as it promised many messages left in this area by members of the Syndicate.
This news is published from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
There will be no one day, and the initial title will change again.
The sound of the police sirens points to another shootout.
The Bojoorquez throws a easy view of a police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show up.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodics - whose middleman is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinoloe - all Riodace employees follow his steps.
"How could we think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "When I was killed by Javier the same day that one intern asked me to send her out to the streets?"
The dinosaurs used stone to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first amazing creation of the size of the rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” - found Canadian miners.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts could determine the red color of his supple skin and say that dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in Current Biology reported that it was the “uninhabitedest ever found dinosaur and one of the best kinds of dinosaurs in the world”.
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in a period of Křída, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by researchers who described him in the words “in fact remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the protective white man is the best preserved by his kind.
The find is Shawn Funk, which revealed the fossils on March 21, 2011 when drilling in the mine of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palestine.
The researchers spent the next six years working to discover an animal from a vast piece of country weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“It’s a bit of an eye-set, and you believe that she sleeps,” said Caleb Brown’s head of work and the natureist of the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
‘It will certainly be written into history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved species of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.’
Through the study of his skin researchers found that this bull - although he was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - he was very likely faced with a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The hard armored dinosaur used a red and white stone to protect against predators and use a masking system that uses many today's animals.
Experts say that it enabled him to get better connected with his surroundings and avoid his enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years old dinosaurs led by Nodosauridae appeared for the first time in the newspaper in May. Currently, it is available to view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him Borealopelt's name as a marker for Mark Mitchell's museum, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team to carefully uncover the fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document samples and shapes of ham and armor all over the body.
They discovered the method of masking, which they commonly use today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part of it.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta's size is far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred masking before confronting.
Many present animals with masking - the purchase of deer, zebras and or belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, indicating that rosadusaurus had to fight for its survival literally.
“The expression of a huge and hard-armed dinosaur illustrates the dangers that the predators had imagined during the cycle of the wing,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the shapins also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had red brown discoloration.
The researchers continue to study the animal and search for other knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach contents, to empty his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken into the sea where he sank to the bottom.
In Alberta, at that time, the climate of Florida and the rivers and the oceans were much further into the inland than it is today.
‘This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved shambled skin while maintaining it in three dimensions and we can see its original size,’ Brown said.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as at the time of the wing.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to make your eyes look a little bit, and it seems like he's only sleeping.'
During the period of the wing, there were huge terrors walking around the earth, carnivorous dinosaurs, who were moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite root of his equally horrific ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with weight over 6 tonnes.
The researchers whose latest findings have been published in the Current Biology magazine believe Borealopelta's body was sailed into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
The find is Shawn Funk, which revealed the fossils on March 21, 2011 when drilling below Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the world's most preserved dinosaur, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the platoon to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two hundred and fifty inches of his shoulder.
The researchers believe that this bulldozer was taking over the territory of today's Canada until he ended up in a river that spits him into the sea.
His submarine tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote the National Geographic gate, “to find a person that is kept up to date can be compared to the lottery prize.
The longer I've been following him, the shocking find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the vultures on his foot.'
How did one activist know the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook contributions on her phone.
She ran into some high school student's contribution.
"The police just shot a 18-year-old young man whose body is still on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @ThePharaah has constantly rectified her contributions to the wall.
Rapper of St. Louis published his Twitter contributions about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old man who shot a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies in a stateless street, from where no one took it after four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She left her phone to return to him the night she was watching tweets about the people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
She followed photographs of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held in hand the sign "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She followed live news - one of the cops stood in front of the protesting group, holding a clue in his hand and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video, he held another police officer, as she said, in the hand of the weapon he was aiming at the crowd, saying, "I will kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've used to and can be called normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately booked her return flight and traveled home on the second day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson in the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?" which will be put in the cinema on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and incompetence from the point of view of people living in a community who go into the streets and demand answers.
Ferrell’s dialogue with her daughter, dressed in a flower dressing and the same flower bee, introduced on the way to Ferguson, about the subject that they discussed many times before - “on the experience with blacks”.
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" remembers the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"It was not considered that I would not take it with me," later said Ferrell.
“ Today’s events are a culmination... of the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but she also needed to know the difference between different layers of black experience and what we needed to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to assure her the conditions in which she does not live on her own skin racism, she is no different from another black child.
I feel like if I protected her from this experience, I would just hurt her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was against the police department, which became the base of the activists expected to be the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who prepared for other food.
Together, they prepared food for bags and helped spread it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
“My activism turned upside down on August 9,” Ferrell said, and added that when studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the president of Minority Student Nurses Assn, she sought to introduce health care and food in the Black Communities.
“I had no experience with organizations.
It was natural."
A few weeks later Ferrell met her co-director, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “just document” the ongoing events.
However, Ferrell thought: “Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used? ”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people who wanted to make money for pain and resolve.
She explained: “We heard that the voices of the people who are born and grow up in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners for death purposes.
His participation in the project was also directed by Ferrell and along with the other six local residents who followed the team "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's murder.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but it’s our statement,” said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the objective of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences - in order to show that the movement “not about the salvation leaders, but on the approximation of the community,” Folayan said - it turned out that she is the most openly open towards the participation of filming.
The document “Whose Streets” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on my face when thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and lick the black guys, I have to open up."
In addition, the Ferrell story highlights the role of eccentric black women in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the murder of the teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 at the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMitter - call themselves weirdies.
“The Black Eccentric Women at the Headmasters of the Final Position is behind the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this expression and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by a large multitude of eccentric black women.”
However, it insists that “this is not just an apologative matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his views.
"It was the driving force and energy source," she said.
“It’s not a coincidence that she found herself in the front lines, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black weird woman is dangerous.
You can feel that energy pressure even before the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, they cleared out the television stations' positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell has a two-and-a-half flight condition for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in an area called home described as "Niebrek."
Still, she's not in her effort to which she's committed since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
“ It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Kolínsk.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, as well as a helicopter.
Near the Czech Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Ivanna and Liblice, the area burned from 14:00 to about 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen declared a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the spokesman of Ladislav Holomčík, the fire from the air helped fire from the fires of fire and helicopters.
At 6:00 a.m. fire managed to put out a fire, fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
With flames on the spot, dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fought.
Fire was created due to a technical defect in the chamber's engine space.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which he made a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the city of intervention to the owner until tomorrow 8:00 he will be guarded by a unit of voluntary firemen," said Holomčík today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
At the center of one of the New York Fridman Gallery rooms is placed immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and eaten - hanging from ceiling on wires. Each of them as if the previous one fell out of the eye.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg's artist from the extracts of the oral cavity and hair that was sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth prison, where an ex-analyst does 35-year-old sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, informatics and art, and Manning - transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose punishment Obama reduced three days before his departure from the U.S. president's post.
The algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and the use of 30 portraits to show what a person would look like with this genotype, created Dewey-Hagborg's blue, if not an intellectual comment on DNA submissiveness - as well as about many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and unthinkable determination of these interpretations as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, had spoken since her youth that she was considered a woman. She was condemned on the basis of 20 prosecutions in 2013, including violation of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison workers. Only one black and white photograph escaped in the lower quality at which Manning, obviously concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig, with which it is now connected.
In 2015, positive responses to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions continued.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensics - such as cigarette pads and gums - to create images of possible forms of these people.
And at that time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“The original interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article by portrait,” explained Dewey-Hagborg on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visitors or photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she was interested in DNA portrait.
The artist and her trapped muse had their friends in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could participate in the exhibition personally.
President Obama, indeed, several days after the release of the comic, asked for Manning's release, which was a welcome change after several insatiable years in the military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is being held at the time when Donald Trump leads a war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incentivise their tweets in areas that should support.
In response to the question regarding this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all things are happening for a reason”.
Under an artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with his huge signature (the song "i" in his last name is a heart-coated name) after the end of "self-inclusion based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side, there is a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA - a stack of letters C, G and A recorded pencils.
By entering 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
“I hope that people will take away from it that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can interpret them after their own,” said Dewey-Hagborgová.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in the separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novels.
It's showing Manning's form of King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Don't ever be silent."
“It is a direct transcript from one of the letters,” said the philatelf artist.
"When I think about it, it's a goose of my skin."
Manning's exhibition has not personally visited - which was foretold in a comic book - but when it does, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by its masks, by its own genome-likes, sorted as the crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high sculptures of Maning, on which the pencils are recorded by its genetic haplogroup.
“In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to have a feeling of crowding,” said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
"I wanted to draw the impression of the mass movement, which takes on Chelsea's form and frees it."
Professor Northwestern University and Staff of Oxford University looking for murder
On these days, an international search for professor of the Northwestern University and employees of Oxford University, who are being prosecuted for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, told the police.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports Cook County's court file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago Police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Police officers were alerted by telephone after arrival to Grand Plaza Apartments found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and the detectives are investigating a case like murder, while police are looking for both suspects, the authorities have put in place.
Lathem has been working on the position of Professor of Microbiology and Imunology of the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering the university's school space.
"The entire matter is now being examined by the competent authorities and the North-Western University cooperates fully with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The spokesperson of University and Somerville College stated in the statement sent by e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police too.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues have been shocked by the fact that they wish to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Public Relations of the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about the place of their stay and efforts to track down suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national police are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said that it is not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim,” said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza led by a statement for all residents: “The police are now working on setting up a time-consuming view and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence. ”
"In the early future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) and to re-establish the establishment of the Russian Anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the Code contains nothing to concern Russia.
“ Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned above calls for the public announcement of the results of the WAD investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, an alleged sponsor of the Doping of Russian athletes by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We are taking an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
It was attached to all measures.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed."
Mutkov's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee.
In an interview for the Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “On many occasions we said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to take the report completely without reservation," Smirnov finished.
WADA suspected RUSADU from carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organisation authorised planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit by the Moscow headquarters in July, the Director-General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "at the right path" for renewal.
The police have accused three people, one of them young.
The police charged three men with setting up a center fire of a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech at Frydecko-Místeck.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech national.
They're up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
The reporters today told the Moravian police director Tomáš Kužel.
He thought it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the theme of the whole matter," Kužel said.
He said that the police would be about the possible incarceration of the accused.
Further information provided by the Director cannot be published.
"I can't tell yet, because crime police and investigation workers are really working on matters, and the state attorney who's overseeing the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God's body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Mortgage damage is estimated to go to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is indeterminate.
Early after the fire, thinking about the restoration of the church began.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the next cost is ready to share with the Ministry of Culture and the city, and the public collection is also being prepared and counted with the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of the Holy Kateřina of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hraba also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
It caused the installation failure.
The exact copy was then made in his place.
The state counts as citizens in defence of the state.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for societies used in the defence of the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers, the legislation on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state counts.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the mission of the government, promises from him that it will be able to increase the physical integrity of the Czechs and their ability to use in crisis situations.
It's coming from a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law was adopted in the future, the State would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the order.
The basic objective of the proposal is to establish an effective system to help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of its duties and on the basis of voluntaryity.
For example, the state would financially or material support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would increase the ability of their members.
In return, he would receive data about people who are willing to come to the country if necessary in time of crisis to help, and about their ability or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help societies and other interested parties to train or train.
It also counts with organizing besed with war vets or people who acted heroically.
One possible variant presupposes that a new office should be set up in charge of administration and coordination of the project.
The draft authors stress that human participation should be voluntary and that their ability should be used by the State only after the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual prosecution of earlier clear borders between different types of threats," states the intention of referring to the threat of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on the support of the widest range of capabilities, not only of those of the military.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very wide base which will enable each citizen to respond to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or life, the health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute, where appropriate, to the protection of others, and to the wrong conduct of not to burden the fulfilment of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their height will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
Another money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of regional military headquarters to employ another 42 soldiers.
The leaders of the Ministry said earlier that the law should also help resolve the disapproval of certain Czech policies with the introduction of a directive of the European Union concerning arms possession.
Its acceptance would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons they require.
The startups that your company will help not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of his employees' e-commerce startup, but she did not find a suitable survey.
Answers were often impenetrable, useless, or even deceptive.
And although she has promised anonymity of the survey, some employees have expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I looked for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, the owner of the e-commerce company of Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
She asked for outside aid.
New startups in the field of human resources are constantly emerging in the market, helping companies explore the satisfaction of employees.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention to measure employees' obligations, startups enable companies to make a rapid vote, aim for specific teams and demographic groups, further offers the complete anonymity of employees and a hot complaint line, and in some cases they also allow informers to bypass superiors and contact the director directly.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit that follow your medical condition, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint launch, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said she gained a greater sense of what her employees think and how she felt, thanks to Glint.
In addition to rapid surveys and votes of specific teams, Glint offers a company’s temperature map and a continuous overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low rating managers - which allows users to work on repair.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is rejected in the scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and the harassment of workers who dare to speak openly.
For startups as Glint represents demand after surveys of corporate culture lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compilation sector by 2020 can exceed $118.8 billion.
Startup Convertent from Denver, Colorado, who helps the company to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Among almost 600 clients of Convertor include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, Convertent allows the company to send a customizable “blue” surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has authorised regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the launch of Convertent.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment with its employees or non-ethical behavior - and if the regulators do not follow - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotting, staff exhaustion or judicial proceedings, he added Quinlan.
The Ruby Tuesday Network, employing over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convertent for more than a year to increase the awareness of employees about corporate principles and procedures and to ensure easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check the phone number or e-mail at the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a obvious solution.
It was often a reprehensible and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way of monitoring employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convertent, it is ensured quick detection and resolution of problems that have never previously been addressed to managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual complaint solution - the purchase of discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It comes from a Holistic, overall view of employees' experiences," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from court disputes by employees."
The companies ceased to take ethics, values and employees' participation in light in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed after Enron’s collapse in the issue of the abuse of ethical workers’ rights, said Quinlan.
But only when “the social media on the whole thing ” began to realize that in the online world, companies could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“ Before people started using the ethics of technology, they relyed on faith,” added Quinlan.
Glint and Convertert offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors that supported both startups.
Convercent chose 10 million dollars in his February campaign from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and finally took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million from Bessesmer Venture Partners in November, and during the whole campaign he won $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, cultures and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more than ever from their workplace.
And competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and valued and that they spend their time with a society that seeks a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employees’ benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convertent and Glint.
Investors earn money when companies and companies are successful if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the engagement and commitment of employees to society, there is no wonder that there will be many investors who will support this effort.
According to working culture experts, it is important to have data about staff satisfaction.
But the data itself is ineffective if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“When you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, Director of Advisory at Kotter International, who was witnessing many companies that were too relying on data alone.
“As soon as things don’t end, the employees start asking themselves: ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey between employees every month, can solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, said Errett.
After the assembly of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision making and the quality of communication, Errett managed to re-organise several teams within the company and to initiate communication training to a clear solution to the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes that this will achieve high employment in the field, which is known to be a long-term release.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent work environment, employees will not believe you," said Vitrano.
“And as soon as you lose employees, you lose customers.
And the entire company is going to fail with the customer outflow."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watchtower in Hodonín, Czech Republic, the hottest day of the year.
He crossed that Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed about this by employees of the Czech hydrometherological Institute.
But, compared to Tuesday, Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit Moravia, mainly in Bohemia.
On Tuesday, the records were overrated or settled to 35 of 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded.
Maybe today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record in the Watchtower.
In Lednice, in Břeclav, today's 37.4 degree, the original maximum was four tenth degrees, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, just like the Watchtower, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower was the biggest heat in Dyjákice in Znojsk and Broda nad Dyje in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37,8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMTU web, the highest temperatures of today were only around 22 degrees Celsia.
"The temperature began to grow there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists told.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually sound, and on Sunday, more significant rains may come.
At most places in Moravia, however, they will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia as well as Saturday.
We've got such a bad mind going on here.
The billions aren't enough for the same vote in elections as any full-time man in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not all are as lewd as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penny Marek Dospiva together with other colleagues with the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryčem sponsors Robejškvy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance and business in real estate by Pavel Sál, who is also a chairman.
The condemned Korean player and King of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta took the Private Party.
The Agrofert’s political movement, as Andrej Babiš’s project did not want to name the other mayor Jaroslav Němec, is the chapter itself.
They caught the Mayors recently.
She's a Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company at Jablotron's secure facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The Entree in the Mayor's Dream didn't work very well for Grandpa.
"I've never had a little goal," he said at the press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the ANO movement to win the Mayors' movement 20 percent in elections.
Lecko's had a laugh.
However, Grandpa’s dissolution is rather significant.
Piedbor Grandpa's a man of firm opinions.
Even though it intends to be about the voter's voices in the Mayor's Dream, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
In his last parliamentary elections, Grandpa supported.
"Babish is not a shooting speaker and does not control a kissy rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But certainly not in politics because he wants to improve himself.
Babiš is a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world under control, and do something for us all.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he learned from his admiration of Babiš again.
And he said that he wanted the Mayors to learn how to cooperate with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his mind, and he's standing behind himself no matter what uniform he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends someone so incomparable to the Mayors.
Others may ask if the boss of Jablotron and the head of the Agrofert did not break down in a bad shop and seek no other way to defend himself with his business rival.
But the first public appearance was not just about Babiš.
Grandpa promised that he would send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been difficult to suspend.
In addition, the courtly recognized gauner Zdeněk Bakal before his elections in 2010 blew millions to all parties.
The political division of the Security Agency Vita Bárty, TOP 09 and the citizens' Democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
Now that Grandpa's entering politics, he could at least have been studying the rules of the game.
Maybe then he wouldn't have to ask why the politics have such a bad reputation.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with higher education will come to us for about 50 grand a month.
Those with less than 20 basics.
A man with 50 grand is rich in this place.
The one with 20 poor.
In his vision of society, poor people are fairly paying taxes and rich people enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state, in which they do not participate too much.
The rich is simply to help them not to have poverty with need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babiš has his hands washed.
The rest of us, even thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that the millionaires aren't good people.
Then there remains a question of whom to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their own parties neither citizens nor citizens of the State have their employees nor their country for their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich land for all men, not just for some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to go down at 234 million.
Sale of real estate sometimes is not easy.
And often, it won't even help him 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the real estate is selling U.S. President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down to an incredible 8 million pounds.
He informed about the Mirror.co.uk website.
It says in the brochure, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like any other.
But not even a real estate company with the US president was able to defend extreme prices.
Donald Trump must have reduced the price of his Caribbean mansion to an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
The villa complex, too, is about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And there's nothing to blame.
The wonderful location of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the link with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
The property is now closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was supposed to buy for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, however, they are placed in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £ 13.5 million.
NCAA decided to quit two trainings a day. Bruins takes long days
The 11th morning and UCLA UCLA football players are waiting on the sidelines of the new school course.
Some of them take off their dressings and reveal their sweaty back, an inconclusive sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes nothing is worth a lunch break.
Players registered in the summer semester will go to rooms after three hours of practice to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 am.
"For these boys, there will be a real poppy next three days," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday went over on Tuesday.
By deleting two trainings on one day, NCAA wants to lighten up to players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least by Friday, when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to get stuck in the already so-called diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, Mora spent on the position of coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited for the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
A total of 18 training courses are planned by August 20, and the formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team are being held in September.
Mora has been heard that he supports the NCAA decision, although he added another item to the already charged player's diary.
"Three or four days, players are under great stress, and it is very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“ But no one gave up, everyone is trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protection net behind the goal bar.
Players of Bruins should take the hotel from this week forward, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty out during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," Mora added.
“ Security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
He's doing a good job dealing with that stuff.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking no. 8.
We'll use our resources at maximum.
I believe everything will work out well.
It's all planned."
Facebook is planning a more thorough control of the facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under original contributions in an attempt to combat the so-called "fake news", said the biggest social network on Thursday.
The company in its statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible faxes that will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original posts.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the election of President of the United States last year.
The French voters are flooded by avalanche of false reports on Mayan presidential elections and Germany is planning with advance before bright elections to make fines on the social media network if they quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook on Thursday in his next statement issued in Germany stated that he was planning to launch testing new functions of false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In terms of displaying messages verified by third parties, people demand more content to be better informed and be able to make the right decision on what they can share,” said Sara Su, a product manager from Facebook.
It added that Facebook continued to test the ‘related articles’ function and also works on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Create graphic novels: story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotland Castle has recently played a major role in the Squeez band's music video and found Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotland was a witness in the Bewl River from his cozy place in Kent, England, 700 years of stormy history, inspired by the korth of Jamie Rhodes from York County - a famous interest in historical documents - to create graphic novels.
"The look at the scripture of a man who is 300 years after death is fascinating me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I can feel a personal connection."
Grafická novela A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scotland Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stones (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was taken by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s, who worked for Jacobite," he said.
"That's a fingerprint for his fingers!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell a letter right now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How do I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinating with old papers, support by the National Trust and Arts Council England organization is, and the possibility to stay almost four months in the castle as a dream. (“To be honest, I’ve spent a little bit of my stay.”)
Rhodes spent time investigating the Victorian “new” castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the heads of hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He went through the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to the shameful, gardeners and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
In the night, he was drinking whiskey and he was writing.
The reliable history of Scotland is relatively unknown, since the National Trust organization gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words, as when “the rivals of many centuries are scattered with their hands, saying: “Bring it into the attic.”
Deniks, letters from the British Empire, maps showing property: “Maybe you think the dispute about land is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I ran into one case when two families were stretching over the shore.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge, and they dive deeper into English history, including the story called The Labourer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a history of rebellion in the castle of 1380, which was called Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex in the book," said Rhodes.
“ In fact, the English rebellion began in this area, and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe in the end it's somehow related."
Other stories are tightly linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during English reform.
Or The Smuggler of the 18th century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly staged his own funeral when he filled the stone coffin (which was found for up to several years after he discovered the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by male generations - these men have always been indebted and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of Darrell's families discussed this by taking rich or old ladies, I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who were with the cover of the heads of their heirs."
End of stay at the castle looking for Rhodes for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week show in the Finnish wilderness, where he set inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotland.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I was like, "Now I'm gonna get the hell back to real life."
Washington changes the green card terms
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, in which it will also change in the award of green cards.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 annually as a result of more stringent rules on the granting of temporary visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules propose Republicans and presidents.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers of taxes, by changing the rules for issuing green cards to other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process favors English speaking applicants, who burn through funds and demonstrate the ability to benefit our country," said Trump, quoted media.
The sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, there's a news on the Internet about the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
The sexual robots are really popular these days.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to the words of former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharpey, it is necessary to look at the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“The people are tightening them up, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable master to robot women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm on touch - of course is artificial intelligence that imitates human behavior.
The user can “adjust” the robot to his image - from the colour of the eyes and shape of the chin to the appearance and color of the nails.
Of course, it is very worrying that many robots have their own "personality" that would also disgrace Stepford's panic.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into a robot woman with silicone skin.
The robot owner RealBotix can set up his replacement wife various character features, including shyness.
And then there is a sexual robot woman Roxxxy Gold to True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including the “friged Farrah”, which is characterized by a shameful nature and “divoké Wendy” with a “natural” character.
“The identity of Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality to a maximum extent,” says True Companion’s website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, called or “in the mood. ”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among whom there is no confusion for real interhuman relations.
True Companion resembles Roxxxy to a man's vibrator on its website.
"If a woman could have a vibrator, why couldn't he have a Roxxx man?" it says on the page.
But sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophisticacy have shown something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - away from the ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for undermining sex with an optional addition.
Of course, most men do not buy a robot woman and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots remain on the edge of the public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until they have a free market to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women throughout the world get their rights and the White House is sitting President, who is often very shameful at the address of a woman.
The sinister aspect of the program The story of the maid is not what we see - hanged bodies and dirty eyes, rather than the reality of these visions.
Book template The story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
The sexual robots are to be as much as possible like real women (but also with pornoherek peace).
Their creators are designed to be pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing to encourage their independence or distort their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
They say 21st century: maids.
NBA star on the green armpit.
Curry is fighting for cut in California.
Stephen Curry's star basketball player has not lost himself in spite of the messed-up first launch between professional golfers.
Double winner of the award for the most useful NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in the Hayward California first round to 74 shots and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second degree with the Warriors team in the NBA this season, started very nervous and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even though he was not as accurate between the pits as he was under basketball basket, he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots above the steam.
"It was not the ideal way to get started, to have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it was a little saddled up," Curry said, "with the fact that a huge tremble fell upon him.
It was very nervous, set off the first punch at the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cut, which will probably be determined by two shots under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I get rid of the tremies, I hope it will go," said an excited golfer, who has already played Celebrations and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsor's exception and maintained an amateur status.
Series Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against this, Mitt Romney is an embodiment of sanity
The unscrupulous sign of Trump's era becomes political decompositions, which divide the American voters and toss the whole family on a micro scale as well.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was in the American newspapers with advice on how to deal with relatives who choose Trumpa.
All we're looking forward to is waiting for the nerve.
However, less attention is given to Trump’s ability to stmble the family.
I'm talking about this because this week my cousin, poet and fanny, who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York for a long time and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that sobriety in the face of a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family is - including all the Republican siblings with whom she was talking about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but I am surprised that this represents a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
As we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrifying possibility of losing his suitors one day for attractiveness.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, who, by resisting his standards, will be a dismay of what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgics in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we had the awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like a very mild move compared to Trump.
After Trumpa's departure, it is sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took the children to Central Park to the largest collage that runs the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find better use if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle roller is covered with glassing - clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders in fear - a completely deceptive view and glamorous music is a strange reminder of public transport.
Some clichés will soon be frozen: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama is looking, rather than breathing on you with the atmosphere and the integrity of the city does not get your ideas.
Eleven years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the London Metro Station.
However, collapsing in Central Park provokes a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two-year-olds like two mature women are enjoying it.
If I could evaluate, he would deserve maximum points, but luckily nobody asks.
This week, I have experienced a similar experience at a store when I was asked to evaluate my "life" on a scale from one to five on my credit card.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can add 15% to the rating tips for something I'm going to buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the other fast sale, but the waitress is forced to intrude in the favor of the shopkeepers when it is not necessary.
A woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I misjudged my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transported from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius must have been transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wrist wounds, which, according to the opinion of the prison, caused himself to fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning at Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the toilet door of the closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said she was wrong about a thief.
The applicants have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year penalty of the Pistorius, which is too modest according to their words.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that it would take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius will be threatened to extend the penalty to up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in the Republic of South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity of a preserved panda who was burned in the wild.
It's a huge success to save panda.
The Centre is trying to expand the genofonide panda held in captivity.
Čang Č-čung has been told by the New China Agency that panda breeding threatens to pose a great risk from the related crossroads.
In captivity, only 471 panda lived at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand of them out in the open.
The attempt to let the captive pandas with those wild ones be so the first step towards helping the panda breed this kind of protection.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the October 11th.
Thanks to the neck tracking device, scientists could watch every step of it.
She met her chosen one Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sex with the male panda lasted a minute and a half, and he was successful.
This can also be considered a small miracle, because the males are not considered to be the most successful lover of the animal empire.
In addition, males quite misjudge the time when the female is ready, are often confused and have no idea what to do.
Young people were born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an exceptional appetite during pregnancy, they weighed after giving birth 216 grams.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on 1 August in the morning of the Sitonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and impose strict fines for anyone who is caught in a place where the campsite is not allowed.
Check will take place all season.
The Ministry said that a court may impose fines.
The saw is the first round British Open in the 50th place.
Golf player Klára Spilík is set on the first round of Major British Open in the 50th place.
The game in Scottish Kingsbarns went around score one punch under steam when she played threerds and twice the Bogeys.
The 20-year-old Czech player has the hope that for the first time he will pass through a cut on the famous major.
The entry into the competition with a subsidy of $3.25 million came out of America's best star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in record goal 64 shots, which is eight under pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
180 poultry have already been temporarily closed for the incident by the Netherlands itself.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Supervisory Authority announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which, according to him, means that 80 percent of eggs in the market are harmless.
The Authority pointed out that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identified according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and for adults is not present, but the potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also joined the closure of breeding, have not recently imported into the Czech Republic.
However, vets will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland on which the problem marks of insecticide appeared on the markets.
According to the veterinary administration in the Czech market, eggs from the Netherlands were last in May, according to the Belgian egg.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the products against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, animals whose meat is consumed by humans must not be served.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feeling sick and dizzy.
Riga is beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, says goalman Sedláček, looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"I'm going back there one time," suffocated with a 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlínský dres.
Depends on whether he gets involved until the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it as at school, in three.
I didn't catch much for the first year. I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've learned.
I started catching for the second year.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I used to shoot again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch up all the time.
But we only got five points during the opening ten games, so the trainers started to spin.
In the end, my friend got more caught.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riz?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're going to be married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for the goalkeeper?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Sloan who have to change their game style against them.
Skills are on the other side, so you have to replace them.
It means playing more back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is the Russians want to play empty.
They're shooting at each other, and even though they're half-empty in front of each other, they're more likely to record.
In the Czech Republic, more fires are fired.
Didn't you have a problem travelling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
She can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done by playing like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotys feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
Latvia's been watching hockey, along with basketball, is a national sport.
Everybody fancies.
Even though it didn't work out, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinam’s action in KHL help that Latvia almost stepped into the quarter finals at this year’s world championship?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results at the world championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Soči fell in the quarter final with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
Still more Latvian players are heading for Czech extraligies.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts was established and prior to signing the contract, Ralfs Freibergs.
What's so many of them coming here?
They're not any bet players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotys are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unattractive?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on with Riza.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was classic.
We had fun with different teams, but they decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, and I'm gonna wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
I was four years ago when I left here, and I didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the option that you're going to start a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens next month.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer to have a contest?
The last season wasn't like me to choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government outbursts at Let's go.
In January this year I wrote in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper, including at the camp in Lety at the Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the difficult passage of the article to be recalled.
The camp in Lety has been talking for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it'll be probably best when they look, for example, at the official site of the cultural monuments Pietá place Lety.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8th 1940 served as a work camp, from 1.1. 1942 he was a collection camp and from 2nd of 1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including the nonhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 5 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
There were 420 total.
A very sad story of the enormous hardships of human beings that caused them human beings and degenerate ideology.
There is no reason to remember these events all the time.
Nor is it a dispute that this reminder should be seen in the memorial in the place of the sufferings they experience.
The problem is elsewhere.
It was a bit forgotten at the camp during socialism, and in the 1970 ’ s, it was near and built on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp accidentally discovered an American Paul Polansky in 1992, in 1995 a memorial was discovered in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy back and take up the veto, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998, the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under Lidice Memorial has fallen.
In July 2013, he invited the UN Human Rights Committee of the Czech Republic to conclude the convent.
A very brief fact about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last autumn, the government approved the buy-in and decided to make an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is then going to buy out the outside.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably have the intentions if I went to the public with them."
Let's see what the expert assessment brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions may be, according to others, the price can reach a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be cheap.
At the same time, just a few hundred meters from the former camp, there is a memorial to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were to be financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not at risk, it would be just as much money-making as I think.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragics and anyone who wants to do it can be the memory of the sufferers and the murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the pie place with maximum care.
A responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the care of a proper economy owner, as well as the money of taxpayers.
At least with the same as your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
But I still see the password of the leader of the ANO movement from the above facts as an empty pre-lection curse.
This May I went straight to the scene.
Very decent drive, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp huts.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and looking at its own pedestrian place, which is created from stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and garlands.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as it pleases and belongs.
At present, the site of the original camp of archeological research is being held.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the discovered foundations could not be preserved and, in an appropriate manner, at least visibly made available.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could push his efforts.
If he manages to buy out a public money from the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already very problematic action as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolates may reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal proteins and dairy products could help to relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An irritable disease affecting up to 1.3 million inhabitants of the United States and 300 000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and milk products to ease the symptoms. However, researchers in Washington University have found that essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps to create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
The lead study by Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestine and ensure that the harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protects the body without causing damage to the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of weight lean on the side of the inflammation, inflammation of the intestine may occur.
In research, scientists have discovered the presence of immune cells that support body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the formation of cells the presence of Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiom and cell development that supports body tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and diets rich in Tryptophan would help develop a more difficult and less inflammatory gut environment.
A postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of a type of immune cells supporting body tolerance revealed that one group of mouse testing had these cells, while the other group of same mice kept separate cells lacked.
It was because one group of mice had a different gut microbiom - a community of bacteria, viruses and molds, which normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse tree was tested by a method of decomposition of DNA and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing the other group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and they lacked the gut microbiom - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given the L. reuteri bacteria - and they formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerance cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid it turned out to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in a mouse diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice and most of us keep the L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether L. reuteri by-products of Tryptophan cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tertofane-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably seek the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of Tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with Nemanje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United has acquired into his team "genia" in the form of Nemanja Maticia - at least he thinks of José Mourin after he debuted in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a 40 million pounds contract, was introduced in the first match at 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-study match before the UEFA Superstar, where the United States met on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and engaged in its role as the backupman alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team’s pre-war Asian tour, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes, which according to the word Mourinha needs to be working before the start of the next season of Premier League.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has brilliant thinking -- he's thinking football," he said.
"We will help him to get into his condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, even his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourin are slowly starting to shape his 11th season for another season.
Independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with other three players, but insists that the club has done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Fours of four would please me more, but I acknowledge they've done my best."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-sanctioned picture began to grow thanks to the new show on Prima Zdenkova Academy.
The girdle immediately hit the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to apply this to your Academy of Cooking because, my hand on the heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he invited him in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been on the hook for several years, he hasn't forgotten to bother him this time.
"In return, I can teach you znojem from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why it's favorite fried cheese," Hrushk said.
She's serious about her participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to step up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said about it," he said.
But he didn't express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, chef!
Only Prima reacted to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy with the fact that the whole matter is taken as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
Hrushk Pohlreich settled a large wound in December 2004 with his first cook.
Over 300,000 pieces sold to her in a few days!
The new programme, which Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn sending scheme, is an unfalsified cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from a number of viewers, and in twelve parts they will meet with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now she cooks the boss in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt ironed on a severed chest.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"On top of the pear, it's just a bit bit of a bit - it's a healthy fruit and it has lots of vitamins," he responded to the Lada.
Love's culinary arts think of theirs.
"I can cook according to the Love of Hruška it's not even at home, because I'm not letting go of my home," my boss is clear.
Zdenka Pohlreicha I appreciate myself very much, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
On my show, however, his recipes are definitely not going to show up," Hrushk did not forgive.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabet or asshole," said Pohlreich about Hrushk on one lecture.
"I don't have twenty to be able to touch hands over them, but I don't solve them any more," Hrushk said on the account.
The British Inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by swinging
The British invention became the first person in the country with a microchip in the body. With a simple fixing of the hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
The three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between the thumb and the index finger and currently offers the same service through its company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist of Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, is under surveillance of the implantation and treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to replace locks of doors and cars compatible with microchip.
A married father of one child had technology integrated into his house and his BMW Z4 car, which will start with a simple hand wave.
White House Review cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House decision to come with a helicopter Navy to South Lawn on the occasion of the celebration of the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the Navy records issued by TIME week, at 24 000 dollars.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the program from July 17 in the White House, which was the show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House were watching the show of products from all 50 countries.
The Helicopter of Connecticut was exposed next to the yachts of Maine, the fire truck from Wisconsin and the forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued a fragmented order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the arrival of a helicopter on South Lawn in the context of a "murious" event, reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such important events," wrote commander HMX-1 in email to his superior, representatives of the Navy commander of the day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the show, whose start is scheduled at 15:00 and remain on the spot until the full clearance of the whole place planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if the late departure from the White House is delayed, a replacement crew for the return flight will be sent for a regulation on working time.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening with the helicopter and together with them a security unit.
From the records - which TIMME received - it was not obvious if the second crew was sent in the end.
Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," the deputy commander wrote down.
This "Made in America" show was marked by the White House as an official event, and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But the official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the President promoted a health reform that was going through the Senate and talked about an attempt to maintain government regulations in line with.
The use of air means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence is purely due to presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's plane was driven in the background during his first meeting in the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is clouded by complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
“The White House is pleased with the “Made in America” show, which presented products from all 50 countries produced by Americans from American materials,” said the deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train Washington landings and South Lawn and train potential arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight for Made in America was part of the current crew training, said the state officials.
The helicopter unit on the same day flew within the "non-president mission" for another 11 hours.
The White House stated that no other props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
The spokesperson Sikorsky said that the company was not in any way interested in making a helicopter in South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the Presidential Flight Budget and the exact costs related to the show are difficult to determine according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is the refund of the DoD expenses for the VH-3D 24 380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate the time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are much below that amount.
"The cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," said Walters.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD expenditure compensation does not cover staff costs, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Back then, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of helicopters for show purposes.
"The "Idea show, which takes place this week, is to present products produced in the USA," said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of helicopters and other military devices in which countless American citizens are produced.
This fact is meant to be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter at his trip to South Lawn. With certainty, only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky’s representatives and was joking with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "your own three."
The young woman was stuck in a swamp near Mách's lake, the police were sneaking up on her.
The girl went to the beach on Sundays around the second hour of the morning.
Instead of swimming, she was trapped in the wets.
When she decided to ask her cell phone to help the cops, she had 12 percent of her batteries.
"Therefore the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Baláková.
A couple of police guards went out to a place that described it, but finding a young woman wasn't easy at all.
"Some of the officers had to broach their racosa mochas hundreds of metres before they felt the land solid again," Baláková approached.
And so she was missing.
The cops were determined by the direction from which her calls for assistance were based.
"In order not to lose this connection, they agreed to her that she would respond loudly," said the spokesperson.
Only three quarters of a woman was found in the swamps in the Born area.
She was on the edge of both physical and mental forces, and she was giving signs of colding.
That's why she was transferred to the Czech Republic by an ambulance.
Widka's connection with the TAN?
A woman becomes a sales girl from a desired bride.
It's a little irony.
With its web project, searchameslusny.cz as a millionaire to voters, he basically said that STAN suffers from the deficit of decent people.
And he also created that a politically unnatural party of less known mayors and independents, actually has no national programme for the House’s elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion he has.
This is how Vit Bárt started, and it didn't work out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, which, if possible, will replace some mayors as well as Gazdík, also cancels the popular argument of Chief STAN, that the greatest value of the movement is politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally most popular politicians and according to surveys.
Now, they're going to be able to cut off the short-term unknown.
The total dissolution with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík explained also by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN suspected from identity then little more than ever before, after his grandfather's arrival, the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík had long defined against ANO Andrej Babiš, but Grandpa, who publicly praised Babylon, said as follows: "My goal is to get the ANO movement, that is, the Mayors' movement has 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't get the move wrong.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and there's no chance a millionaire.
Politics often speak of as Babish, unlike him, but I will not be a political brand.
STAN has been more like a reality show for some time than a real political party and a grandfather's helping hand, as if she's even more of a sales girl than a bride.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone hear from us.
Police dogs practiced in Mosto crossings helicopter
Dogs specialized in searching for explosives and search dogs today trained at Lake Most crossing helicopters.
Police dog must not be fearful and fearful of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the St. Peter Tomášek Region.
Police dog training takes about two years.
They practiced both adult dog training and those who were just going through training.
In addition to standard training, in which all 12 animals were to be exposed in the lake's sharp explosives samples and to seek lost mantle, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
To get on the helicopter immediately, the dog can go work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's path.
"He will reach the helicopter, the dog will go and seek immediately," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or unable to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of them then leave them for instance in the garden," said Tomáš.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ústecký Region.
German sheep rule, but also the Belgian sheep.
The dog's been taking care of him since the puppy.
"He keeps it himself, he prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," said Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal possible healthhensikeps.
If the dog is healthy and unobtrusive, it shall consist of the first test in 20 months.
"In sharp intervention comes about two-and-a-half years," Tomáš added.
The length of police service depends on the dog's health condition.
Most of them are eight to ten years old.
Most of them live with their hospitables.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, were put in place at the centre of the UN's representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the UN Assistant Mission, said that elections to local representatives are attended by hundreds of women, three women are about the post of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his midday statement.
The choices may be fully representative and credible only if women and women participate, as well as any associated processes that relate to the choices.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process, which is moving the international fighting activity to the other direction.
This year’s elections are the first time passed by a democratically elected government to the following government.
Haysom said the strong roles of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan independent electoral committee stated that from the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are women.
A unique brewer is cooking beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewer.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a brewer in Lobč u Mšen a few years ago.
The Brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century was converted into a paro-system operation.
It followed the years of bloom, when a brewer was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, the production was stopped during World War II and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, they've served buildings for a state ship.
Part of destruction was made by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devasted and taken into account for building materials.
In 2007, however, the new hope of new owners, architects of Jana and Pavel Prouzová was revealed.
They began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The Brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of the Brewery for the cultural monument of the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Roads of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015 they also celebrated the tradition of cooking beer.
If you want to taste a great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the bar in the beer area.
During cooking beer here uses coconut water springing in a protected landscape area, malts from the lobby fields and Žatecký hops.
You will taste a traditional light spoon in the haircushion, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, held on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half the second.
The biggest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest strengths of your type on a global scale?
Such a unique construction should be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the field back above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to form up to twelve bunkers connected with a vast underground.
Here was the headquarters, the casino, the ammunition warehouses, the material, the power plant, the engine room and the hospital.
However, the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, the only massive iron bunker was built and underground space broke out.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who started to rebuild in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is made available from 75 percent!
The premises include the T-S 73 with exposure and underground and armed light fortification, two built-in foam screws, coves and an educational trail fixed by Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy altánek and stunning views to the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and wonderful Czech building has reached a list next to monuments such as the Great Wall of China, the Traian Port of Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineve and Nimrod.
The monastery Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today mainly forms a huge four-cylinder building of the convention over a beautiful garden.
The list he's got on, but unfortunately he's one of the unique buildings he's in.
But the Nazis don't want to give up and to support the monastery, they're holding a lot of action.
One of them is another year of the evening for the monastery Chotěšov this Saturday on the fifth August, where you will perform. Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Vocal, you will see the Šerměřská performances and look at places of beautiful large constructions which are usually unavailable.
But you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Would you like to see the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to Neanderthals in the Athropos Hall of Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest right until the Stone Age, into the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals have been able to cope in a perfect way with various extreme climate conditions, especially by changing ice and interled times.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also know how they looked, what their anatomia was, technological skills and hunting um, but also their aesthetic affection.
Wouldn't you say that to the Neanderthals?
Let's make sure of it in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday at the Veveří Castle.

Know a plant by one click.
Students with herbists and ordinary plant lovers will help new free applications Pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they just hit on a walk, these applications will advise them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself knows what kind of it is.
A new application available for iOS and Android was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre of Ethical and Environmental Education of CEEV in Bratislava Park in the City's Secret Life Project.
Even students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were involved in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site the secret life of the city.
The main goal of the French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that applications can recognize.
"The children who maintain the tablet or cell phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Based on good quality photos of flower, leaf or fruit plants, the application can recognize its name, which is then in Czech and Slovak according to photography within a few seconds.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovenian and Czech into the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute to a plant image that does not yet exist in the database after the account has been created.
"The French will assess if it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
Concerning GMB's investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Departments require insurance from managers of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer with a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that, for the time being, the company is silent regarding any investment in a factory in Tollcross.
There are over 500 employees in the factory who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that she invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area over the previous few years.
It added that employees and representatives of trade unions would be "the first informed limits" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In their letter to the building company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitsie's “will not be given his promises to finance and modernize production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not get clear answers from the builder about the needs of society and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families and employees have worked here mostly from the local community and the Glasgow region, where work in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the perspective of Brexit, the rising cost of living and slow production - needs the eastern part of Glasgow desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
Pladis spokesman said: “Tollcross’s contractors received a letter from GMB just yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, since we value a continuing commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operation on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and efficient operation.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and local sites and, in the event of any changes in the operation of this factory, employees and representatives of trade unions will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to be acquired on her side after she has deposited 189 million £, i.e. the amount needed to purchase Neymar from the contract, but has warned this French team of Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
The Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid $89 million in last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athletes in the world - after tax the PSG team will collect more than 500 000 £ per week.
Barcelona is upset by the way Neymar took out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to meet Neymar in all things since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this fact three years ago by President PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we certainly talk about one of their players,” Al-Khelai said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they are trying to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the lines when she expressed interest in PSG Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances would allow the departure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona now has a bitter pill in its falsified negotiations with the departure of Neymara.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad rules?
Donald Trump was snooping against anti-russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan President Madura.
And before that, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like that.
Even a cleaner idea of sanctions as a shoe straw.
You can't put those things in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really went out on the road to the dictuary, to the totalitarian.
China doesn't just act as the US president would have wished.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it all up, so that even a common voters, an American, a European or otherwise, understands what it is and what rules are based on a policy of sanctions, it would be a task almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely draws on what President Obama has already intended, but it was only an implementing stamp.
Then why so upset?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump was to win the American election, she would be able to deal with Putin and withdraw sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the opposite.
The sanctions don't release with Trump, but they're tightening up.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like the kosher is only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
However, they are neither kosher nor anti-russian sanctions of the EU.
The Head of the European Commission, Juncker, is complaining that Trump's sanctions are jeopardising the EU's energy security.
What, like using sanctions just so weak they don't threaten anyone?
The common voter's groping.
He heard for three years that the fate of anti-rust sanctions was dependent only on the fulfilment of mines' truce agreements in Ukraine.
Now it learns that it is the EU's energy security.
The sorcerer's hotter and wide.
There are sanctions in Russia for being too montified where it doesn't belong.
China is skinny because it's not enough.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All those sentences or just reflections have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, a law, or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossing the Republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardic Region, all candidates are already prepared.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed that Moravskoslezski should lead the captain and shadow minister of the education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a captain," said Babiš.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your thesis that direct elected mayors and mayors should drive the municipalities and cities themselves, with only the managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we vote directly from the President, and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about the interference of the representatives, they can still be there.
The question is how many of them will be.
When I presented your book What I did when I accidentally slept, I heard on your own ears that you were talking about the cancellation of the representative.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reducing the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor's saying that she's not enough to build and not prepare big projects, but she doesn't have a competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman were driving in our history.
I'm not saying they did it right.
But the current prime minister doesn't run anything, he's the only one who modulates the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to get laid.
There's only a change in the program to the one-wheel election to the Senate.
We also proposed a gloating mandate for ministers and the amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to prevent unnecessary exhibition by Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not show themselves at meetings of the House.
It's definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
As a dictator, you will control the House with 101 Members, decommit the countries and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors, you will take over the whole country.
It's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with the debate on the number of Members.
French President Macron reported a reduction in the legislative congregation by a third, while there is a lawyer of 57 thousand French, while it is based on 17 thousand Czechs in our country.
But no one is accusing Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if in the Czech Republic, someone has won the election most, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
However, the contributions for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There's no danger in the case of an ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work for people in the government, not for our parties or the resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to only increase the salary of teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why did they vote me over and add 21 percent to GIBS, who's already taking 60,000?
Would you like to catch up with that as a prime minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when the ministers are acting uneconomically, they are confused by the government with travel agencies, and for money the state would like to do as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government don't have to argue, they're supposed to talk out of it.
There must be finished materials in the cabin, there is no room for coalition cracks, power votes and deals, there's a decision to make.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers act first and foremost?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition covenant was not valid, and Babish went out of the government.
That's what any prime minister can do.
However, if a personality is and has control skills, a similar planable gesture does not need.
It measures everyone the same, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, but I don't think we're gonna be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So many skeptics aren't in place.
The mayors have acquired the businessman Dědk, who would like to cooperate with you, may be able to win the wing of Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaralek, which is not excluded by the Coalition with ANO, the ODS may be prescribed for Václav Klaus ml, which will not be against either.
I'd leave it on the voter.
Vicepremier and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the oculars come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, running as a puppet of Vita Bárty for VV, then getting money from Dawn for his company, ran some punk.
Of course, he's a distinctive personality.
Of course, it's a little brown.
If I take his program, there's a wide range of people involved in company management, direct democracy, that's something that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if he is an acceptable person with xenophobic opinions, speech on galley demonstrations and wants to step out of the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went to politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't imagine it, but they're going to vote for the voters.
It's about negotiating a winner with the other one in order, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's the double.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the agenda of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your efforts to drive as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka had everything to go, never decided.
Coalities such as ČEB or EGAP have not worked.
But Saturday's his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ ruled the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought the resolution written by CEZ management, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how he should vote at the General Assembly of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff conditions of the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ's top management?
Jesus, if I'm gonna be the prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not that guy yet.
It's been heard that ČEZ has already sent out your signals.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with ANO.
Maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any lobby of Pokorny or Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I don't solve this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are headed by the government, will you seek the exchange of CEZ management, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, i.e. institutions that criticise you?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent society.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to the commission for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is keep an eye on Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has to stand in ČEZ, he never drove him, he was only in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivia thing for me.
CEZ should take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange funding, make a supply contest or get a coinvetor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech TV?
Some of her shows are leading me against a permanent purpose campaign, but I don't have and I don't have the authority to throw someone out.
But control is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public service and television, but they don't actually know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of the Directors General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at these reports, they're discussing the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, who's always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission to escapes from the investigation file and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he was pushed by Kalusek to throw me out of the government, which won the TOP 09 percentage, but ČSSD took them.
They're afraid to breach their corruption system, so they're talking about the threat to democracy by Babylon.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how First Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds up the power base by adding his son to the Tepláren Brno Supervisory Board and by providing a related lawyer with Květslav Hlín with a contract with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company and the Czech Railways?
There's a permanent dispute in this.
I don't like it, and I've done it several times.
Faltanek argued that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvílová, March.
If there was any sign of clienteleism, we immediately fired a man like that.
In this respect, I'm uncompromised.
If something like this happened, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
