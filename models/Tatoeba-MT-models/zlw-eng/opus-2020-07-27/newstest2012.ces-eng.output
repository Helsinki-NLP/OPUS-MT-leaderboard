Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Timothy
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to cancel, under the amendment to the Criminal Code, a paragraph on the basis of which the opposition leader Julius Tymoshenko was sentenced.
The invitation to open the way for the release of the prisoner expremises refused the second reading of the proposal for the reduction of penalties for economic delinquency.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison in October to conclude an alleged disadvantage with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not competent, the appeal is to be discussed in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the judgment as political revenge regime, suspicion of the legal status of the court caused the process even in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365 should fall out of the criminal law, on the basis of which the expremier was convicted, support the vote of 147 Members.
226 votes were needed for his approval.
Libya's Victory
The story of the Libyan deliverance, or the Libyan rebellion, has already been broken.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is after the war.
We've got to define the winner.
As there is custom in the county, the Islamics will win the elections, but the question is whether dying or radical.
The Transnational National Council has applied to the customs law of the Sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because a hand is being cut for stealing.
Women can forget the emancipation, any dissidents from the faith are waiting for execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a company consisting of the rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we can't imagine and which we certainly wouldn't want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor the objectively best, and it is likely that it would not fit those people mentioned for change.
In fact, it is a wonder that Islamic fighters have taken gratitude from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view NATO was not leading the raids of some general from America, but Allah, whose size in each of the resulting interventions was celebrated.
Thus, when the winners of Libya are seeking themselves, the west is not among them.
We took part in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any benefit.
After the fresh bad experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy military.
As a result, the problem with the extermination of the Crusaders is off the ground.
But they'll have no oil company left behind the mouth of Libya's black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast the unharmed protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, we've got the mark of the Sharia Law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe got into the search for investors
Statistical shock went too far across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has staged, Germany and France are growing.
The debt market, however, is breaking records today.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some of the other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data during the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (the increase by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France said that it appeared in a slight decline by 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 percent this third quarter year.
Fourthly, however, the gross domestic product (HDP) stagnated and, according to the ČSÚ, confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
Results are worse than estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 percent this year in the third quarter, but it stagnated on a four-year basis.
The German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally translated data.
The economics of the euro area and of the European Union both between July and September increased by 0,2 per cent against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year.
The return on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The proceeds of Italian and Spanish bonds are increasing to critical borders.
Problems begin to feel also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Exports to Czech 10-year bonds are under 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
Germany has voiced that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrates the procedure for 200 million
The most difficult task of the season has taken place!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Bohemia and the beautiful goal of Petra Jierčka won 1:0.
Czech football and a large portion of luck in the second half has launched a luxurious home rematch and will not be missing again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the gradual gameplay in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great portion of happiness in the second.
Czech representation also thanks to domestic waste in the end, the great Bohemia and the hero Jiráček won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrates the progress of the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech whole, the Chernohorts got into pressure until the second half.
The Smolators of the match became Damjanovevich with the V manager who burned down two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter Bohemia such a Czech representation will not be missed next year at the European Championships, a reward of about 200 million crowns will also be added to the home football money.
He's been playing a lot of fighting football since the early minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in a combination and mostly played around the halfline.
The pressure of home football players therefore did not come in the first half, the long digs for defense were very reversing the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred colleges have created a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country’s nuclear programme against possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed at noon on Tuesday before the object and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Iran in Isphahan created a live shield around the Isphah nuclear technology center in which uranium is being processed on Tuesday.
They thus show that they are prepared to defend the nuclear program of their country with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran did not seem to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is spoken of in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Islamic nuclear building and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the most paralysing Iranian nuclear programme, Israel’s press would also aim at a facility in Natanza in which uranium is enriched.
Appetizer of the obese child: does not eat and eat dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an overweight weight of 9 percent of schoolers and obesesess is 5 percent of children.
At the same time, obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as shown by the current survey.
It shows again how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns around it is surrounded.
Tables in obese children, for example, appear half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried fries had for dinner the day before the research of an event related to Obezita is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent of the obese.
There is no habit of sport in fat families, but most of the families of today's schoolmen have only 15 percent of the children have responded that their parents will find at least once a week to move actively.
Study between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of Obeita's event, not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
More than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project so far.
The right diet and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the asked ones said, for example, that she had five times a day in the breakfast-stupid snack-stupid dinner dinner, which is one of the basic assumptions of correct nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast, no evening taken away
Experts note that there are significant and relative details for healthy development, including regular family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families eat their children at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst thing was to find out that ten households don't eat at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily meals.
The questionnaire showed that poor fries are consumed more often in families of obese children.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
While regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children concerned, the result was less than half - 15 percent in their parents.
Set up your dining room
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own menu according to their own taste and self-esteem.
"The adjustment preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideals in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods is a lot of flour, meaty and sweet food.
"Alarmating is especially the great taste of sweet sodas," says the final report on the survey.
For lunch as the main dish, pasta won just over poultry.
But children basically didn't want lumbers, and there's also a lot of fish and lunch vegetables.
Adequate to health
At the same time, research showed that children are willing to adjust their dietary habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of participants who have completed a questionnaire after the end of the Obeita educational lecture, there was no coincidence, in a number of cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition" is set out in the results of the project.
It was Markant for example in sweet sodas, where more children would start giving preference to ordinary water.
Children have also seen more frequently in the questionnaire on poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet food and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, says professors
In the opening article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit of a complain that there's been a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was going to follow.
The lectures of three professors in the field, the clothing of problematic figures and the seminar about how it goes on the set.
It'll get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "caught."
This time we discussed with Director Alenka (there is no only one boy) how to dress a woman who has no perfect, consistent character.
And that is the vast majority of them.
Someone has a short neck, someone with a boy figure without proper curves and someone overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to optically brighten the wide shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We've got tips like Jennifer Lopez's, bigger breasts and hips and narrow passports, a character to highlight, and at the same time women don't get too suspensive.
For example, if there is a difference between the belt and the sides such that skirts or pants don't really fit, then it's worth taking at least one of these toes.
You're definitely not gonna regret this, 'cause the perfect falling clothes are priceless.
In a dress of peace, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves on, summarizes, leaves in the belt and the like.
A guy's character can afford to wear eyelashes, applications, heights, or charge.
Of course, such information and characters are a lot, so I'm glad to have all the information in my head for a week.
And I'm still afraid, given the homework it's all about.
Each of the courses received an assigned celebrity to devise two outfits: daily and evening.
We must take into account the current look, the fashion style of the individual and the type of character.
I'll dress up Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret camp.
In the spirit of the sparks, for me personally, certainly better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently gained about a hundred pounds (become, please in the question of the surplus), or young Selena Gomezová.
We need to wipe the tables out of magazines or search the Internet and print and then process the boxes later.
Moodboard, as the result is said, will express our personal style and relationship to graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is important.
The stylist does not only heal physically but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific inputs, such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But it's Sunday.
The Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday lecture, loaded with information about character types, three of our guests in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is illusion and stylist should be able to use it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is essential in this case.
So, for example, one can wear a trenchcoat (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) with a pair of jeans and a shirt like a coat, but you can wear it also on a bare body, a pair of boats and take a picture of it as a dress.
Or you just pull out your sleeves or collars and it looks different right away.
"Hold it," he stressed.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," James said.
Finally, I understand why we're dealing with all the lessons we're dealing with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines, we're seeing something else.
Not to mention the show.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist has to have a lot more clothes ready than how many of them he's going to take.
So at a fashion story, which will have ten sides (by now ten outfits), I must be prepared to "be ready" at least 15.
And also that she looks at a picture of her clothes and works in combination with other pieces of jackdy completely different from that of reality.
We must therefore count on this in the production of outfits.
That image and style makes the jackdy up to half the success, confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, which isn't exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her the world's old.
So far, access to the use of stylists is rather cold in the Czech Republic.
And the familiar faces of the jackda consider it useless (although I can do something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone's already made styling from us, then we're supposed to count on the fact that we're highly likely to have a completely different (lower) size than he really has.
Then there's no way to googlize and see if the tabloid wrote about how the celebrity turned out and so on.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario gave us the heart that the stylist was not enough to focus on fashion and to be able to put outfit.
In his work, he mainly communicates with the people he wears, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to encourage yourself, to be behind your own mind.
"If you're ordered by a manager to cover her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things you praise and recommend what you wear," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what everything has to contain the so-called "plac" or a bag to the square.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you've got all the stuff you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rolls or closed pins, there are also elephant thread (with it the stylist helps to photograph products such as purses or hats), special clips that we can put down on the back of our clothes, if there is a bigger (spend or any other clamps are not allowed, they would destroy the clothes), or the sewing.
In order to not listen, but also practically try something, we learned how to fit our shoes properly.
Even when shooting in a studio, where the flat surface is, the sub could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we're adhesives and adhesives.
We can't even touch the shoes without any damage.
There is therefore a need for real skill.
Mario pleased me when my creation, without reservation, praised me.
Well, that's because he's not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we interviewed about the second weekend course.
I'm getting more and more clear that it's not really a walk through pink sad, no matter what anyone wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree driving is changed due to a series of completely unnecessary layadic errors in the routine morning trip to shicht.
Although ambition was largely fulfilled, it was not valid when no one clearly wanted to do anything else.
The Run woke up before issuing high expectations.
He promised that the Nieed for Speed flight racing series would again move a piece of new direction and from playable demonstrations he appeared as a game that would not only have to be numbered in the course of action racing.
We were also wondering how they'd get the embedded passages, where the main hero would get out of the car, and he'd run out of his way.
However, as in the NFS series it is customary, many are somewhat different from what we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing has been pulling down a few unnecessary mistakes that have occurred in the series for more than a few years.
So it's actually not a mistake, but it's a rather incomprehensible expression for developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are put in a story whose main hero Jack has some problems of personal character and as a solution, he offers himself to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and that the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment of feeling that the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-wide thing.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains acts visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are sealed with some unusual element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you will get into a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to fall asleep by the avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well planted.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to pass the desired number of opponents (as a classic race), then you get time (classical match with tracks) and then you need a duel with a single opponent.
This will also involve the police from time to time, which will make your efforts worse.
The news is the passages out of the car.
It's more of an interactive animation, when Jack usually runs in front of someone, and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it will be surprised that these passages are much less in play than you would expect.
The result is, however, to the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance to become annoying and in the context of the above spoken one, it is so lined up to the elements that the game is processing.
The food model goes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely no longer anyone today, but it can't be said to be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will need to look elsewhere.
But even more interesting racing of the model here still fits quite well, even though we can find better in competition.
So it's all in perfect order.
However, the problems begin to occur after some time.
Unlike a model, it's not too good to be a model.
From the game of this type we don't expect to count complex deformation and collision, but if you have no idea how your car behaves in front of any impact into any object, then I guess it's not all right.
Typically, when driving or mixing cars in normal traffic you can only easily lick each other, but in almost identical situations, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even assault.
Well, thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter at all, but it's going to make you more confident.
The restarts are handled so that if you break or go far off the track, the game will throw you back on the last point on the track.
But only five restarts are available in each race.
When they are exhausted, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is therefore rather such a help in the event that something is not going to happen, rather than that you could rely on them in the words.
But sometimes even the restarts won't help, they'll solve them when the need to learn a given section of the race will be forgotten.
The great failure of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go in a specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit in.
Other times you will meet at the given location "civil" cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
It'll get angry in situations where you see how between two opposite cars the enemy can easily run through you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to drive or take them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "scheduled" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
Coopers have another advantage.
During the whole game you will encounter several places where you, again, regardless of the time, will always pass the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it hit the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get in front of you, obviously, at any cost.
If he's going before you, you're gonna get worse with a look at the opposite cars, so at first you're gonna get a little crazy out of there a couple of times.
It can be understood the intention to make the game more intensive and Adrenalinistious, but the execution is so obvious that it will surely neglect you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple model, playing is fun and places and so much action, that sometimes you don't always follow where it flies.
And it doesn't matter whether it has a merit of a concept with 50 unique lines, decommissioning races so that boredom doesn't have a chance or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to replace cars during races.
You need to be careful about the gas pump on the road, because that's where you can change the car, even though in most cases you're done with what you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American boulders on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example, after narrow mountain roads.
With the main story regime go hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in different locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
For getting a higher driver level, different items are removed: starting with cars and background ends for profile.
This is also again connected to online Autolog functions, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other difficult hooves is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (i.e. where you drive in the dark at the tracks).
The numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (i.e. to be) are drawn on the tachometer and in the back of the subway set and you are uncomprehensively dissipated.
At the editor's office, we're probably gonna have a conversation for a few more days about whether no one really thought about making the game or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It freezes in some more severe moments, in some cases quite tragically.
However, it is mainly a storm with a larger number of participants, where you would not be able to see smooth imaging.
Sound page is fine and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest range of the younger audience, a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog different village", but it can be assumed that, due to listening to music, someone might not buy the game.
Overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much despair.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the past few years.
But that's how the game works inadvertently.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready to make mistakes to shake you into the eye with a force of airport spotlights.
The UK Music Choirs will ring a velvet student concert
The merger of the International Student Day and the anniversary of the Samt Revolution with a musical experience has already been offered by Festa Academica for the third time.

Ambassador to EU Viceen:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to calm down, and before all the players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador began to prepare her lecture at the Faculty of Law at the Faculty of Law at the European Union, Milena Viceen.
As far as "intelligiblely and openly about Europe" she is serious, she has already shown in the first part of the lecture, when she has been able to describe individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of teachers from the Faculty of Law could be pleased with her.
Vicenova also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the first place, there was a criticism that it was inconceivable that he was a grey official, that he could not perform any role, and I must say, "that all the breath had gone out, that the role of the role has gone well."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate perfectly with them, and he has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which telephone number should I call?", i.e. a major step towards unification and greater clarity of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants us to ban the sirens
Vicen also focused on the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government's impact at this time was then marked as a huge negative, which has greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech Representation in the EU is currently very busy.
The Ambassador's words, "Fact frmol" were not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is being addressed today.
In addition, a new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is precisely why the current economic situation is highly complicated.
Whether the budget will be slim and cost-effective, which sectors will prefer, which countries will be supported more and less, all of which is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: "About Europe understandably".
"I don't really like ugly shorts, foreign words, Hantrek who no one understands.
How the citizen is supposed to understand that in Brussels, they don't really come up with curved or round cucumbers, bananas different sizes, or that they really need to stop the sirens."
He also wants to make better use of the EU's environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We are expected to be a multi-speed Europe
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of Euroskeptics and people who notice rather negative than positive pages of things.
Moreover, she is sorry for the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She believes that there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four have been highlighted.
"Trust me that when Polol and Hungarian come to me, the Frenchman will say next to me, "Hey, what are you going down there, what's your Visegrad four?" and they're not really making it out there."
The future of the Union, according to the Vicens, expects mainly new tough rules on Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real then sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe rather than a new "European Federation".
"We have a country of the euro area and a country outside the euro area."
"We have a Schengen area, we have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said to cooperate only with the countries that they want and those that don't want to stand up."
"Your institutes will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principles, according to which all the topics that have an impact on the whole Union are discussed among all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM is beginning to exist in the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express the IBM strategy, it would probably be the closest thing to "long-term."
For the general public, IBM has been a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company that has been perceived as very current, yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this long term was given by the first company leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already hit the password that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant will be restored (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means the long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and spent a hundred years living because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around herself.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first centuries.
We hope that in the second hundred we will be able to achieve even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano on the anniversary of the current director Samuel J. Palmisano.
Developed system
In the 1930 ’ s, Watson was taking care of his employees, similar to the business of Baťa in the Czech Republic – people from IBM had paid a vacation, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system to reward the best founders and traders.
Similarly, IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in the mining of talent - as one of the first companies in the world, canceled any discrimination so that it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, head of IBM, next year, is a woman - Virginia Rometta.
It has been operating at IBM for 30 years now, with its position as head of sales, marketing and strategy.
The IBM has been making so-called pits in recent years, on-line broinstormings, from which many future strategies and innovation arise.
No wonder the ideas are enough - the firm's working nearly half a million people.
Institution with a good name
The firm provides a firm with its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a rather concept of institution rather than a technological company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," he added to George Colony from the consultation firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and making the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue" as she is referred to by her logo in the United States in a familial way - in a hundred years she grew up into one of the world's largest companies.
It is probably the most extensive technological company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
They hold the most patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, bar code or disk.
The IBM had about $220 billion this year become the second largest technological firm according to market capitalization (the first one is Apple) when Microsoft first started in 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations have hit customers' taste and time - IBM has, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy service or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you cannot emotionally relate to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they do not work, they leave them.
Unlike the competition Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Perspectiveing Technologies
IBM's markets are the largest share of services, after about five they are software and hardware.
In 1990, however, he was with more than half a share of the strongest representative hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold underly profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investments have also continued since 2008, when the new financial crisis has first crossed over the world.
IBM is acting as a reference to its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the big economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price rose 120 percent, the company’s net profit continues to grow.
The company's password is to change everything, but not its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History IBM: From cheese tailor to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established a hundred years ago in New York, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of companies in Canada and South America.
The foundation for a later IBM gave a merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as famous "sands," i.e. hours recorded by employees in arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also president of the company’s supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then engrossed the Founder IBM - on Watson's ideas, the invincible corporate culture and identity are still built.
Watson led the company until 1952.
The IBM, as indicated by its name, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from carvings of meat and cheese to cash.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and started an extensive expansion of the company into all worlds.
Watson was so inevitable to the company that after 40 years in the head chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, cut him out.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960 ’ s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly flights to space - to Merkur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "péce," which established the computer standard of that time, named IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the Chinese company Lenovo's computer production, and on the contrary, she bought a consultant section of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully provide advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years of IBM - is the concept of the Smarter Planet, the Smarter Planet, the Smartr Planet.
Its objective is to use technologies smartly in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city management.
For the trade area, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders to drive the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history even in the country.
She founded her branch in the then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a centre for strategic outsourcing in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a research team of the world’s level of voice recognition.
An unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After Joseph Rychtar’s husband (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also the lover Darina hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's waiting an accident, and she's set clear rules in her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtář.
When Darina Rychtářová provided Bartoš asylum in her house in summer, she probably did not seem to have any idea how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta moved away after 30 days from Říčan, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
During the time Darina resigned, with the relationship between her husband and her husband, she was at peace, and now she even gave him goodbye forever.
Rhythms don't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Rachman and Bartoš broke up once, his wife's open arms won't be waiting at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will expel him."
"He will live it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtář, saying that she has left her husband away and insists only on mutual obedience.
Josef the fact that Darina closed his back door, so far, it's okay.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I'm gonna be with Iveta and I'm not gonna change it."
"The wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I'm looking after repairs, gardens, real estate, I'm buying."
"We're having a very normal time with Darina, except that we don't share the bed together," said Lightning Rychtář.
If Rychtář found a new love too, he said he wouldn't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes with who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take all responsibility," Josef concluded.
The worst women's habits: do they concern you too?
If you ask the men if they can name any typical woman's habit, everyone in one is very hot out of the sleeve.
Dear women, will you be familiar with the following lines, where there are several women's habits that can perfectly pump blood in their veins for men?
Shopping
Does your second half say you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
You like shopping, and you like it on discount?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least take a little time off by their shopkeeper's passion.
But tell me, which would resist walking around the clothes store, looking for yourself a well - fallen uppers and then trying them all (idealally in various color designs) in the booth?
Even though he's a horse-buying woman for most women, he can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you told yours to wait for you before the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Aren't these sentences reminding you of something?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to the way their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the increased frequency of this complaint is the more annoying women.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless circle.
Washing windows, draining, embossing tiles, cutting dust, crushing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you tell your partner that he stepped on the dirty floor, the kids that snuffed up the washbasin and peeled the glassed living wall with which you had so much to do with the polishing?
If you suffer from this particular "hell," try to realize that nothing is to be exaggerated and order and purity should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationship with family well-being.
Rifting
"You used shorts put in the basket."
"You're gonna wear old socks tomorrow too?"
"The wet wipe doesn't belong on the ground."
If you go to your partner like this several times a day, know that you can drive him so confidently.
Of course you don't mean anything bad, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have had to go so hard on them...
Apologizing, gossiping
For some women, there are also rumors, gossips, but also insulting and relying on someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to go through things like who, where, with whom, and why.
Let's hope each of us have some little harmless gossip or a glue out here.
Hand on the heart, it's probably all women's own.
On the contrary, the most thick grains, which like and often daunt, may be despised by everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially in the context of the female working collective.
Jágr and Voráček helped the Philadelphie winning assistance
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jágr participated in the Monday NHL two assists for the Philadelphia 5:3 win on the ice of Carolina and is again led by the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player in the match.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jágra's partner Jakub Voráček.
After the battle of the overseas journalists, Jagr claimed that Giroux had foretold a great evening.
"I told him before the game, he'd give the hattrick."
"I felt it."
"The moment you feel this way," explained Jagr, whose action Giroux goal was given by the first Flyers.
A few minutes later, the team had a second hit with a Czech trail.
Voráček fought for the Hurricanes disc goal and presented it between the leather circles to Max Talbot.
One second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer's home player decreased, but the launch of the second part was once again Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he scored the third goal, then he pulled his shot at the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd be playing with a homieer like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play on me, now it turns," Jágr added.
Carolina, from the match, made a drama, the goal of Tuoma Ruutua, and again Dwyer, who got himself out of a criminal shooting, got into the difference of one goal.
But Matt Read didn't let another complications end up two in one.
"Excellently hit our Pronger zone."
"He pulled out the disc, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest pole."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the match from my point of view Voráček.
Philadelphia won the victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win the fight against Buffy, in the second third period he resigned due to the upper body injury.
Candiens, next to the experienced barrel, lost two-defence lead and lost after a penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids hasn't changed Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points was a vast mare of back, and they played only five defenders.
"It's wrong."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing we can do about it," Jacques Martin said.
"We couldn't resist. "
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
In that we had gaps," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech goalkeeper, contributed thirty hits of Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters were divided about the Jets goal, which interrupted the five-pass series.
How the tour prices developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the vast majority only tours to the countries of the socialist block, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled so on vacation to the NDR (Germany's Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Socí na Crimea u Černý sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (commit to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel even to Yugoslavia, but the Yugoslav regime tended to the West and the paths of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the times of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist block (i.e. also the Czechoslovakians) allowed individually to travel freely in socialist countries.
If the citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, then he needed a letter from this country, otherwise there was no individual way.
Travel agencies offered tours to the West at that time, but they needed to stand up for the night with a sleeping bag or have a "good known" in the travel agency.
However, it has not been won.
The so-called foreign promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to 'politically incomprehensible people' who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a free exchangeable currency, without a foreign promise so it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The Czechs, however, had to spend their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs had taken place today.
Since 1989, the Czechs have been travelling through a real revolution.
While it was our maximum vacation in NDR or Bulgaria by 1989, Czechs spent 4,5 million abroad permitted in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that to us the most popular Croatia has not been able to travel by 1989 because it has been part of the former Yugoslavia.
Immediately over the 1990s, visa waivers to neighbouring Western European countries came to an end, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits mainly by Austrian Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough trips to the West for a while. Everyone wanted to take a look.
For example, in Paris, Czechs' trips were burnt in the parks of tents, because our incomes did not allow for us to pay for the hotel or the guesthouse.
The typical feature of Czech travel at this time was to take out their own food, cans, salamis, etc. to save themselves.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely variable Czech crown, so our tourists could finally purchase Western currency after many decades.
However, our level of life and average wages increased, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started regularly since 1997 to prepare tours by charter air connections, making it possible to converge quantitative discounts compared to the past incredibly lower.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs have had visa-free connections to practically all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which has continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of porvolutionary travel came in 2000, when due to considerable demand it was taken from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotics, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, the Czech tourists have sailed out to warm remote countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
There are around 100,000 Czechs in exotic countries today!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our porveil development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States of America cancelled a visa for Czech tourists and our country was definitely among the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their elected abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent for the first time in one foreign vacation including the cost of stay more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The General Meeting is to find the Prime Minister, but once again, it's dangerous to wear a stick.
Almost five months is Czech football without the chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Haška to the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known for another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburce.
There is still no agreement, according to which election order will follow.
Without it, he won't even begin to vote on which one of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football has Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned to function in June and when he left, asked his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hask football, he slipped back to the ground between the two chambers of the union that can't match the common candidate.
This was shown on September 16th, when the new chairman should be elected.
The delegates of the general meeting went to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, to the end, because the negotiations remained blocked and was not just a method of choice.
In fact, there was neither agreement on who had the right to vote at the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or even the post-delegation officers.
In this single point since then, a partial consensus has arisen, which has also helped the recommendation of the Constitution to the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there are still differences in the election order.
The executive committee, which, at its meetings, has not taken too much lightly into the situation, is basically not dealing with anything else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neutralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do you proceed in round 3 to avoid the possibility of a heel?
"The problem is whether to follow the opinions or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association.
According to the proposed model in the third round, he will win the one from candidates that will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to a retreat to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must obtain at least two-thirds overweight at this percentage score.
"But that would be the meaning of two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-commor concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian party Freedom, according to which it would be best to not bend and vote according to the terms in force.
Although it is estimated that all candidates are most compatible with the designated electoral order, Tomáš Paclík agrees with that.
"I wish that it should be voted in maximum order."
"In order to not devise any religious nonsense like at the last general meeting," said Viktorie Plzeň, the owner, who ran for the first time, and in his comments, was defined above all against Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
In Nymburka, according to him, the new chairman will be known and believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All passion will calm the possible progress of the national team at the European Championships today."
"Fitbal will again be at a happy wave, a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Apple actor, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's tougher.
"I hope in the deal, but unfortunately, the situation is a lot torn up."
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations for purpose."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"But I hope that he will overcome the common sense," Rajchl said.
There's been a lot of time left on the deal of all sides.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete at all.
The air special in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague because of the technical breach in the morning and sought to replace themselves, as part of the executive committee to repair the return to the barage area.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the Ministerial level, which may occur on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to make the scattered parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the established general meeting of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Pack goes to battle for president because they don't see a suitable candidate
If the football manager of Plzně Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) and would not have applied to the battle for the highest function.
"If the quality adept exists, I fight for him and I don't go to the election."
"But, in the present situation, no one could find such a thing," said the CTK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchle, Paclík's motivation to just make Pelt the alleged favorit election, he tried to stop in the way to FAČR.
It also stresses that, in the event of its victory, the chair would last until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the agenda.
In his function he would be happy to see an experienced and top manager who is not too attached to football events.
"I spoke with some people who would come into consideration."
"For me, it was crazy when some said that, at this point, they don't want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that look," he said.
Paclík says that Peltovo is now most concerned with his connection to Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at a general meeting.
It is unacceptable for Paclík so that Pelta stand in the presiding position.
"If he won, he'll end up in the current state and nothing will move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a useful businessman, it would not have been any more successful in football," Paclík said.
It also points out that Peltov's name sounded in dissidents years ago during the investigation of the corruption affair, but Pelta came out of it without punishment.
"I don't know what a prestigious football for Peltov's victory."
"And how would we also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who, however, already looks at his earlier statement that "he would sell the Plzen club if Pelta had become the chairman".
If Paclík was to triumph in the Thursday election, however, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the glow general meeting, which ended with the fiaskey.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to see."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as head of representation."
"But managers couldn't drive the association."
"I also do not stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who raised great attention in September by standing for the appeal of the referee in front of Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
The stick says he'd be running a trophy association.
She has been calling on her ability to run private companies since last summer, she has also been running Pilsen, which she celebrated her premiere league triumph with her support in May.
"I have the power to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its particular culture."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplineal and appeal commission, which goes to an disgusting situation," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, from the Spartian boss of Daniel Křetínsky.
One of the priorities of the FAČR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help political peaks lobby for getting more money from lottery taxes in sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, so I understand their argument, but they must say on a plane where the money goes," he noted.
As a burden now, Paclík does not even take his connection with the Plzen Club, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "external".
Pelta is back connected to Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Duklo.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense in transferring my shares in the Plzen club, and in a year and a half," Packlík said.
Pelta promised new opinions of the FAČR to rule out the electoral base
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of a choice, the FAČR should have new opinions, which in the future would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order.
The Jablonic postman is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburce and believes that the electoral struggle will significantly dampen the possible success of the football team today.
Pelta has already promised before the unrealized election, that it is in representation and the acquisition of finance will be decided to concentrate in the event of a choice.
In the election before the last general meeting he decided to go for the last minute, so he could throw himself a two-month delay in order to defend his ideas of football management and present himself in a wider context.
"The people at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it is high time for the Association to lead," says the man who is connected mainly to the Apple Club, but who has worked for many years in the Spartan and the Executive Committee of the Union.
Therefore, he considers that he has enough experience in order to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria in the time of Ivan Haška's government was behind current elections problems.
"The Lord at the Red General Meeting was approved by statutes which were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we should have pointed Pelt to the chair since September."
He has just reworked the most important document of civil society as a prisoner to the delegates.
"If I become Chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if this fails."
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," Pelt claims.
He says he's trying not to limit himself against his opponents.
He had previously seen that he could imagine working with Henry Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well known that his anti-candidacy would be his first Vice-President.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for long time, who, on the contrary, left no dry thread on Pelt.
"In football, something has been moving over a year, he's already gained some successes."
"But his attacks were unworthy, and a lot of people jumped off the election campaign."
"Therefore, a number of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt's address to the opponent, who said he remained faithful to the curses he had announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competition to the representation.
It should be an interpretative box of football.
"And I would also try to end all the spheres starting with Bohemians or the beginning of last year's corruption scandal."
"At that point, I would go into dealing with both the private and the state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," said the ČTK, a six-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to football would not mean any personnel cleaners.
"I should first learn to fill individual employees," he pointed to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from a long powerlessness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the general meeting, they believe that there will be no delegates to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If the only point at issue is how to vote in the third round, then we can get over it."
"Fitbal needs credibility, and it only gets here by finally having his leader again," Pelta stays two days before maybe his career's decisive.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would have started working hard under him
If the new President of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic were elected to the fourth general meeting by the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to work hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to make systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to settle cauz Bohemiaans, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue to work by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to serve football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representations, professional football, performance football for young people."
"I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," said Rajchl in an interview for the CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to divide the competence in the executive committee in such a way that each member is devoted to certain areas."
"And I'm going to do hard work to keep football a mile ahead of each segment."
"A lot of people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I know I do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question every step of mine," he explained why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up because they would give up others."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's been motivated by the continuation of the work that Hašk started with.
"In the last two years, he's done a lot of work, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are started processes that will be up to a few years, and I would hate for anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if the next candidate Miroslav Pelty was elected, he said that the situation on the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's a thing I think Mirek Pelta can't do."
"There are people behind him who would make football so that he would only be chosen for the ones."
"I can tell a lot of things, but I'm sure not that I'm with someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone's gonna have a good time and not just those choices," added Rajchl.
He also rebuts the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I intend to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would split into a Czech and Moravian part whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be a present situation where only three Moravian wholes are in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Prague club Tomáš Paclík has been involved in the fight for the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I can feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as my Vice-President, and he sees that I find clear success," says Rajchl, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns in disadvantaged contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the contrary, he believes that the union does not pull a rope.
While Pelt claims that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", the other of Paclík's opponents considers to be a strong candidate who has a football offer.
"No one can question that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he was elected, he'd probably continue in those things that Ivan Hašek started here, and he wouldn't substantially change personnel' cast in commissions."
"He would not want to twist it in his own favor," evaluates Rajchl's rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
Razdaliště from the point of view of Ufonta, the luxury pool in Budapest: Whoever travels to Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after tour the cities or travel to let his tired legs rest in the thermal spas.
The book will show where the wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder went out in the past one and a half years on the discovery path, she could not miss her luggage: her swimwear.
She looked up to a height of artistically shaped dome, sailed across from a marble poutti (a little naked boy, a child (with wings) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored Art Nouveau.
If she likes some of the regiments, she put it in her notebook - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history.
More than 200 sails explored this way a story about the architecture of Meder and now presents it in its published book "Badefreeuden (Radost from the Bathing)": People's sailboats in Munich, historical palaces of sails in Schwarzwald,"Trd core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Cesta for the most unusual spas in Central Europe": Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited the localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germana is a true enthusiast of plárenian culture.
It's not too much sport, it says Meder - it's something else in the water.
It is only anger that fan swimming has to satisfy the blue ducks and the smell of the hops, while the healthy runners can breathe in a tasty smell of cloud forests or listen to the happy brooding of birds in the park.
"One day, I asked why, in fact, we must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder.
"That's how I started gathering nice floaters."
Water level doubles architecture
Sliding in a jump pool and essential oils for a sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the spitter can be a real trap for the eyes: "The town of the floor has a man in the spa water."
"It is transparent, however, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: tall vault, varied tiles, jumper board.
Maloformátý objekek "Badefreuden (Rads of Bathing)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about architectural and cultural history of historical oasis wellnes - but it primarily stimulates the taste of jumping into the blue.
A remarkable copycat discovered Mrs. Meder's regiment in his search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas, such as 100 years of old Šéchenyi spa in Budapest, he found water with nitrogen in the original karst cave (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkalic water and are located in the building of a bottle shape (Városi Termálfürdö v Jashberéna).
The beautiful view on the other hand offers many heated sails under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. As far as one has a beautiful outdoor swimming pool in the whole city, he can look at the snow covered by Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which he can watch traffic on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three top open pans in winter, a couple rise while behind the mountains Ötztal eye to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not on every platform, he went up to a pool collector, Mrs. Meder, in a chloro.
Many of the thermal baths are smelling in the sulfur, in the Arpad spa in the Hungarian Békescsabah it smells of fuel oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he got into the spas.
The smell comes from the healing water with a content of alkalic hydrocarbons, which is almost black and which are planted on the skin as soon as only a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in his search for nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she hit the closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovic designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the disintegrating windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau buildings, she saw a massive increase in weeds between tiles.
On the other hand, they built themselves in a magic platform in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wilddad.
These spas have already completed three stages of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanal elements that come from the time of its creation in 1844 but also the Maurian Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995 Palais Thermal is a popular spa place, a pool friend of Mrs Iris Meder, not only because of Schwarzwald.
"It's already a performance, to combine such a diverse building style into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersing in the thermal pool seems to be a marginal matter.
Agrary speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its agricultural raw material business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann assigned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, then, the chief of the company wants to raise consequences.
Hamburg -
For the social citizens, it is clear: 84% of the Germans, according to one study, are considered unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the questions even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of this trade because they are the worst problems in the world.
This is the result of the Forsa survey with the responsibility of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in the middle of October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets at global commodity exchanges run prices to heights and banks therefore carry a global hunger problem.
Consumer protectors’ campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act alike.
Initially, commodity bets were thought to ensure that traders were against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agreed that the capital market participants had an interest in high risk trades had been cut off from supply and demand - and the poorest was profiting on the account.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised that the extracts would check out and said that no trade "is worth giving a good reputation to Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international work group of extracts from Foodwatch-Report is controlled.
The check should be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
By the end of January, the representatives of the banks want to inform about the consequences it can produce.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works his help on his image.
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened its criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows especially drastically how the bank today harms the general welfare."
Have Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyer do the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items in its portfolio for which money is used for bets on food prices", said Bode.
"I don't care if Mr. Ackermann is a hunger for people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's perspective appears to be surprising at first, but it is clear that the company's boss would like to leave his office with a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of Board will not go to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from a disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And they don't have to worry about possible losses - they should finally consult his successor.
Each other would account for investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday he published Bode anket, in which the Institute of Forsa questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is 11 percent as legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which bets on food prices are linked.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would have billed out all the investments in which money was linked to speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn a known bank, 49 percent said that it would reflect its account’s termination and go to another institution.
The House of the 21st century in Vienna
Poultryed baboon
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won the prizes, became in Vienna museem, remained empty and abandoned.
Now it's opened again as a exhibition house.
When it is hot for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then Austrian pavilon architect Karl Schwanzer is a prestigious and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was then received by the Grand Prix d’Architectur behind his light and highly-acting steel and glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He was famous for the architect’s future exhibition by building a pavilion of Austria.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palác plus as a key performed by the side construction in Munich, finally in 1973, he became internationally famous.
As a temporary exhibition construction designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition, they placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Sübadhnhof (South Station), renovated and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "The House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for museum, neither spatially nor technically - no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Still, it was used until contemporary art was in Vienna a new stand.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has seen more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz bavilon has renovated, now bears the name "house 21st century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Museum Belvedere will open to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect.
He established a new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted by a history of art with a significant career, including the youth of the Krassullar, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum and as the founding director of Musea Moderna Salzburg, established a strongly reconstruction with politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, works of Fritze Kuruba of the same name foundation should be issued, the coffee shop and the bookshop should be built and the office building had to be built.
Hard surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the perfect cast.
Not only did he significantly reconstruct and spread Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau constructions in Vienna and won the competition, but he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University Vienna and Pavilon was a "immittently important place" where he looked at the exhibition every weekend.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building which had already been moved to Vienna and changed its use to its generosity and lightness.
During the modern reconstruction, there were far more problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fibers reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
The cold bridges of the cell carriers have been strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos filled with the ceilings have been sanctified.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, an abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leads to the entrance of the bridge - almost new construction, but still a high-rise Schwanzer Hall.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is covered in an old anticorrosion red brown color tone.
And even the cinemas are exactly the same as they used to be.
And that's all for strict supervision of the memorial office and the low budget.
"It must have been often found material that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
I hear it was difficult with the Hall, "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical Drop-in-the-City-History.
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be proper self-esteem".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, as urbanistic happy coincidences have occurred: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, a newly designed "Městská čtvrť near Main Station" with office houses and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another lucky chance: the 21st century house could receive support from other Krischanitz buildings, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as it is heard, it is already a city about a neighborhood in Schweizer Garten.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in a millionth.
The track came out of a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter due to train accidents and late release Deutsche Bahn this year, according to the newspaper reports, more than EUR 70 million.
The newspaper "Bild" provided a preliminary report on the reference to the Internal Business Plan that it is estimated to be totalled by 2015 with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
It is said, among other things, that the number of internal and external staff is doubled to 16 000 people to remove snow on railway equipment and onboards.
The aim is to get rid of the platform into operation and 90 percent for the operation of necessary switches over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, he warned the boss of Drah Rüdiger Grube after meeting at the highest level with the government and industry before the train failures and delays during the winter too.
During the last winter period, the track in passenger transport had significant problems, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for years on approval by the Federal Railway Office.
In addition, the delay in the processing of ISI trains is being followed.
The track has also failed for years, too, that the repairs of ISI trains must probably have been more frequent in control when one of the ELI train took place at the Köln Central Station to destroy the axle.
Deutsche Bank applies a million fine in the US
After the start of boss Josef Ackermann, there are new trams in the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough problems at home, it was still in the field of its past in the United States: Frankfurt institutions are paying $145 million in compensation to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
These are the sale of mortgages.
The NCU's financial market regulator calculates a whole range of major banks that they have seduced cooperative banks by false promises to purchase financial products; that risks may have decreased.
In the course of the crisis, such papers have lost significantly the value and the banks have put into abyss with each other.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the subject without having to draw the parties to court," said spokesperson Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not plead guilty to the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, who committed to paying $20.5 million.
Mr Debbie Matz welcomed the integrity of both monetary institutes.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the US and is responsible for bankruptcy in order to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is attempting to recover the compensation for the billions of damage.
Now the settlement is the first of its kind.
The regulator was also attached to other large banks, and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In question, this is called Mortgage-backed Secretaries.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the real estate in 2007, it became a number of financial companies fatal.
In September 2008, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed their thoughts at the top of the financial crisis.
Even though the event took place a few years ago, the banks are now blowing sharp wind in their mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous actions to reach corrections or raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of action.
It is 18 international large banks that two state-owned finance companies dealing with the properties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at mortgage stores in the volume of about 200 billion dollars have disadvantaged.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA action, which is more business worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority shall require the French Institute to be responsible for "essential losses" without stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffyt enters with 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru Buffyt invests massively in the IBM IT company.
He bought shares worth more than $10 billion from March.
So far an important American investor Warren Buffyt has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, he has now read IBM’s business report and changed his opinion on investment in the business.
He had already had to understand that IBM was mainly offering services and providing computer systems for the IT-division of other businesses.
Warren Buffy's investment is considered fit for knights in the financial world.
As a result, it is called the mothermind of IT IBM now "Sir IBM".
For Buffy exposed the CNBC's American economic radio station that he bought the IBM shares worth $10.7 billion from March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5,5 percent.
Buffy Sagate, that neither IBM knew anything about his involvement yet.
He praised management, which he sought for the economic crisis, even for proper return.
"You've done a great job", said Buffy to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and powerful computers for companies.
Buffy and technology firms have been rather avoiding until today.
They claim that it invests only in undertakings whose activities also mean.
Instead, Buffett was hit by a freighter, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large-scales such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with wise investments of one of the most valuable enterprises in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffy's investments became known, IBM's shares increased by one percent before the storm started.
"Big Blue" as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is treated together with Apple and Microsoft for the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so much Buffy, he wouldn't want to come.
Founder Bill Gates is a confidential friend of his.
The threat is tangible.
Following the discovery of the "Buňkau in Zwickau," Turkish media doubted about the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about "the bloody ideology" that is now reliving.
The murders of eight small Turkish entrepreneurs and one Greekmen between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report in Turkey and within the German-French population in Germany reacted with fear and worries.
For many German Turks are coming back from a horror that has long been considered dead: From the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background.
That in Germany there was a xenophobia that had never been doubtful.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals the range of which the dimension can no longer be seen.
"Relives bloody ideologies?" sounded the headlines of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the Sabah newspaper emphasises that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent to the Institute Protection Service and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality has been seriously reacted by Germany: it has mentioned a weekend of demonstrations of silence before the Brandenburg gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, Turkey’s municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, was remembered by an act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
A common life has been inspired in happy colors - as history of success.
As a Polishman there is news of several Turkish media: "Dárek náměstí kástí" is the title of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports about the background of the murderous series.
Also, the issue of the "Hürriyet" letter for Germany cannot be taken to avoid this thought-related connection.
"It starts to smell," the title of the column is from Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and their work had been murdered and brought an important contribution to the recovery of Germany.
It is most critically discussed in the German internet forums the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why he did not attack the German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extreme circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are shown to be rhetorically fasting for the use of drastic means: "If the activity is continued in this manner, there will be nothing more to the immigrants than its own defence and armedry."
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"On the quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What it means is that if the inner peace in Germany is at risk, it will be explained by the bombers in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photographs of the burning site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the bombers made a more evident sense of mutuality on the side of the Turks.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press mainly criticised the failure of the German policy after the atents: Helmut Kohl rejected those in Mölln who survived to visit.
Following a fire attack in Solingen, he sent a fearful telegram to the Turkish state president, but he left himself at the memorial festival in Köln to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech, calculated in his speech what fees the Turks were giving.
Quite as if the value of a person is measured according to the amount of his taxes.
Once again, the current Turkish media intelligence shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the state administration is.
In addition to an effort to clarify extensive and new evaluation of rightly extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal bank at the Curish Lake
Europe’s most profitable bank has no seat in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
The UBS suffered almost bankruptcy for the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now a German has to compare it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his vocal departure from the head of the Federal Bank, he became known in July that he would come to almost as spectacular a new job as possible: the president of the Swiss Board of Governors of the UKS - an unexpected and lucrative step in career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to the public, praised Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for her newly acquired robustness and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached its turn."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that everything was going to turn out completely different.
One UBS dealer in London went around all the bank's security systems and lost some 1.7 billion euros.
Head of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland recognized banker, had to leave.
The President of the Management Board of UBS has since also been dusted - and everyone asks, "When will he finally come to Axel Weber?"
It has already become known that Weber bank may advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Management Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's more of a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he sure would need a working time.
At the same time, the responsibility for the Bank’s strategy will then be taken over, once again, by the fact that it deserves the title of "Banka of the greatest scandals in Europe"
For the UBS, however, is huge - until recently it has been the world's largest asset manager - but it has flown for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, does not seem proud Swiss bank will be spared.
It started as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
Image of silent and solid, but also the high-profile property manager combines ambitious objectives: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed on the one hand with $1,6 billion more overseas clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank to the leagues of the world's largest banks.
That was an impression.
The former banker and later long-term banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger said: "I always used to model a good bank to my students."
"From today's point of view, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong greatly.
In 2007, it was first obvious that something was wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the board, who was still considered to be highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
In a few months later, he knew why he left.
The bank's investment division was wasted by Subprime-pcs and had to write down billions.
To keep it steady, the UBS is looking at a total capital increase of 13 billion francs.
Indeed, it was found by real investors, but one over which it had recently covered the nose: the opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that man had not even learned its name.
But that was just the first bump.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billions of losses, the President of the Management Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid management board in Switzerland, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: UBS stood by its faulty investment for the financial crisis against collapse and had to be saved by the State.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss confederation gave six billion francs on compulsory exchange bonds for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such a large bank on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see image).
"One more time we couldn't save UBS," says the bank expert Geiger.
The second one is connected to the first disaster.
For several months, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed willingness to issue the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, reduced taxes by the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as a return to irregular profits from these shops, including a penalty deduction.
This has helped UBS to cut taxes more or less openly.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a competition for rich clients: the sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking mystery was no longer what was before.
It followed the withdrawal of the Head of Board of Directors and the President of the Management Board.
And exodus customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a few months: In investment banking due to bad speculation and property management for tax cuts.
And just when it got a little bit chilly again, just when it thought UBS recovered again, this unfortunate business thing came in: The only dealer wasted $1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: it doesn't seem to be working out with risk management in investment banking.
"Adoboli's case may have found that risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zürich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it cannot control the risks."
But it was precisely the idea of carefulness that Swiss bankers had developed with a long time ago to become the watchkeepers of the great assets of the world: no too much risk, no security for money - also from this side, the Alpine Republic has collapsed again.
The safety of Swiss banks has become a symbol for irritable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially high-quality chocolate.
The UBS Center in Zurich is still suitable for some good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is framed by snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, rental shops belong to the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional stores as Sprüngli's sugarworks.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been established here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, the walls are surrounded by marble, a huge leather chair standing in front of them, beside the bank's logos a big direction towards the "sejfu".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - have - pushed or betrayed the boss of a Swiss private bank.
His name would not want to read in the papers; he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, as well as both large-scale stores.
UBS has probably increased too much, it is found - especially in investment banking, where Anglosas has spread.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say about it anymore.
"And if they had adapted themselves to the long-term English ways."
In fact, it was an Anglosian investment banking that UBS changed, brought her high profits from the first point of view and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven millionth country fell into the greatest rescue event in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in her book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save a large-scale bankruptcy.
How did that happen?
If they are spoken to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was too big for small Switzerland already in the merger - and it grew further.
At the same time, the two different bank predecessors of UBS were complemented by: One rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich with an area of wealth management and poorer, but more internationally involved.
The internationalized investment bankers suddenly came in favour of a lot of money with which they could spin the big roulette.
With this rise of UBS are associated with two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then the Chairman of the Management Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages feelings around the stomach that came up from banking science."
But Ospel said he was counting on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end of his life: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The pride preceded the fall.
Staff members of UBS clearly remember the possessions of executives, on which Wuffli's company leader repeated the same password again: Snit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She mentioned "League Tables", a orderr that documents the success of the bank of that time.
In it, UBS tried to set up completely.
She's done several steps.
The exchange of foreign exchange and shares participated in the games completely up.
However, business advisers who have been entrusted may stress one weakness: In the international interest store, in the speech of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to make an adventure that almost cost her existence.
After growth, they invested both the bank itself and its own fund to secure risks to the US Subprime investment.
It developed into a powerful machine that was repacked on US mortgage loans and passed on - while also leaving its own risks.
Also, when other banks were looking for an exit.
"Although in summer 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS bought," says the bank expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is, so deep down.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
The position at UBS became a catapult seat and until today they become a swing.
The leader of the large bank now has almost involuntary work.
They must find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Geiger Bank expert has already an idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment banking has to be strongly taken away, so is now clear.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti's new bank manager wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only understood as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he settled down: He has long been running the UBS business, she told the Romanian bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to the state in the mid '90s.
3500 seats are cut.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber already asks.
The only thing he's saying to the public so far is that he's going to have an apartment with his lady first in Zurich.
Next year.

The companies produced by two percent less than in the previous month in September, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
This tuned investors in the U.S. sceptically. "We're not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman from Goldman's management.
Europe may not recover so quickly from recession, moreover, there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legend of investing Warren Buffyt just confirmed this view: He said in one CNBC-interview that it will probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too soon to invest in European state loans or banks.

Smart crows are expanding in cities
In many places the ravens are considered to be "problem birds": however, out of the city long ago these highly intelligent animals cannot be removed, experts say.
One of them like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been in the city's picture for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints of the population to the impurity and noise caused by the animals.
However, it is not against the 'problem birds' yet in sight of any means.
The politans probably can no longer be removed from the cities, said experts at the first symposia at the port in East Africa, Leer.
That's where experts from all over the federal territory consulted about possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature’s protectrs also derived from the exodus of particularly protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing construction and the bailing of typical trees to nestle birds make life difficult.
The shells are protected.
Great colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are in the East Soest, the northwest, among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim, in Brno and Leer.
There he launched a contested project of mass killing vran in the rural period negative headlines.
Critics marked to catch animals into the trap for birds and killing sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal extortion, burning, nothing brings," so the urbanist and landscapeist Werner Klöver found out of Leeru.
The removal of nests by spraying water or humming trees often has undesirable consequences, also said the expert on the environment Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Badensk-Württember.
"The animals retreat, large colonies roam and split into other places."
Writing is thought only as an exception to hospitals, residents' homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the city’s problem was not addressed, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of discards of animals from sensitive residential areas and their acceptance to settle elsewhere.
"The information board instead of chain saws" promoted, on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for entirely other treatment of animals: "One of the death in the face can finally be best overcome with self-confidence."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's teaching route to provide information tables on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the sound caused by the bird, Mrs Jürgens had his own opinion: "This is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligentness and skill of animals are legendary: Havrani the field doesn't only use the aid to achieve the pamlinsk, but even as a help he will make his tool.
Students from Cambridge recently tested behavior in four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds is achieved.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must bring a break of construction to get to the larvae of the pier.
Without great training, they knew what size and shape they must have a stone to make a collapse of the platform.
Then, in the second attempt, they had to solve a more lucrative problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larvae mole.
The birds couldn't reach their prey.
Of course, researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them all four animals were made up of a hook, with the help of which she hunted from the pipe of the cup behind the holder.
Three of the four field ravens even succeeded.

Damjanovic fired in 40 minutes from the turn from the border of the criminal territory just around the Czech goal.
After the break, the transverse bank had to save the place of the already frozen world class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic, once again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Branka explained everything shortly before the end.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not cross in Zagreb state 0:0.
While national coach Gus Hiddenk has almost with certainty his place on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can enjoy its fourth part in the final round of the European Championship.

Massacre at personal level
The emotionally strong new book by Peter Engluda, called Beauty and sorrow: The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of characters when you turn your head off.
One advice to act at that moment: carefully remove this page and make it a cover.
For all people are very familiar with Mr. Englund's novel talk and this list will serve you as navigation - as a lighthouse - in moments where men and women in the story will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite rightly, as "antihistorical work".
It contains some very famous names, important contracts or famous battles, but it almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, more like, "the book about what it was." It deals mainly with "feels, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Creature and sorrow" combines a war experience of 20 more dozen men and women on both sides of the barricades, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, get mad or die.
Their lives are like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the convent of destiny, while others are quenching.
The book of Mr. Englund is different from the classic historical novels.
He's fixing the idea that the first world war was just about the horrific dome of the fear of the West Front.
"Creatures and sorrows" is a skillful study of other places where war drama took place: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bee nest falls upon them, must spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids or encounter the presence of the fly tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it's very touching reading.
The war will devour the lives of people like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling gunpowder.
When you start calling yourself a cannon shooting in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with her kids, run away or stay?
Who's actually coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the war has been disbanded.
"Vakuum created from a lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, ideas, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautifulness and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from resumes, letters and other published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound horribly and clumsy, but thanks to the inclusion of minor moments and details, they are absolutely living and trusted.
Many of them deal with suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of the German student, the author says, "In substitutes, all over the substitutes."
"A substitute for coffee, aluminium mimic, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes on and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meat produced from pressed rice cooked in fossil fat (and supplemented with false bone from wood), tobacco of dried coins and dried potato beets, wooden undercarriage shoes".
It mentions that there was "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered substitutes for coffee".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an inner drive to the wildness and brutality, while it declares about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarism behind that scrotum."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will notice, let alone grieve.
"When a person finally reconciles himself to sacrifice, he would at least expect that to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, it seems like a "discipliner that he secretly hangs."
Further comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the introduction of new horrors.
"The conflict has become an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr Englund, "the war between factories."
He caught what he says, "the new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically persuasive mass killer in the clothes cut to the peace that he does his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People are acting completely unexpected, substantiating with heroism.
Mr. Englund describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness to avoid serving on the front.
"The most important example of this behavior was the trade of the gonocousm, which soldiers bought and snuffed their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate man was toss him in the eyes, which is often blinded for the rest of his life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s proselyst, but she does not show anything, which is good for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, the way the war "disciplined the indiscriminate forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about World War I mostly rather than working with complex stories worked with signs such as Paul Fussella's "First World War and Modern Remarque" from Paul Fussella or novels as "The West Front of Peace" by Ericha Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing endings in popularly taught literature.
But I will not tell you.
But you'll feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page out of the list of heroes from his hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake this minute, exactly the time you planned.
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some of the helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the park of Zucotti should be almost empty by now.
No one knew about the event except for a few highly-structured officers, and the other was said first that this was a drill.
At the head of the event, Police Officer Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence stressed how many problems the police had to face during the operation.
They could not repeat the cases in the last few weeks when, for example, pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, breaking the rules of separation and, in addition, the wave of sympathy of the public turned to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at cleaning up Zucotti park from demonstrators was initiated after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders have been inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercise for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zucotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened the so-called training to reduce anxiety - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid shift of large number of policemen - focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place Monday night at the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park arrived literally "at the last moment" stated someone who was originally explained only as "work".
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this event, and no one has ever said that they were going to Zucotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that she would remain anonymous.
"The only members of the department knew that he was going to Zucotti Park."
One reason to hide was the lesson that the city had already received once.
On 14 October, the city leaders planned to clean the park, but then they withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they took them into the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's actions were attended by policemen from various units, including intervention groups from all around - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen the quarter with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people are coming into the park, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be at least as many people in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the borderways of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge Bridge Bridge, cargo vehicles with arc lamps and ampliones.
The lights and messages recorded that were storming out of the ampliones have spooked many demonstrators.
When members of order units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed their stuff and left.
The police say that until 1:45 a.m., she didn't touch a single state, so she wanted to give demonstrators time to pack up their things.
Other teams of police have been spotted gathering at the edge of the park so that they could enter if an arrest had been required.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne's chief spokesman said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her unit in action and, moreover, some police officers have acted rough on them.
Mr Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street led along the western border of the park could film without any problems.
Police progressed in the western direction and flowed through the density of the change of personal protesters, including luggage and plastic bags of clothing, and followed by teams from the hygiene department, which immediately buried everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators, who refused to move, were removed from the park.
The most angry group of demonstrators has gone to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lies near the center of the park.
Some have created roadblocks and police have begun their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp tied each other together.
And two people tied up to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 in the park, there was no arrest, you announced Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, it sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said there were approximately 142 people in the park.
Most arrests took place due to the "organization of riots and the imposition of resistance during arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, was the most high police officer on the scene.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but he didn't participate in the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, the block south of the park, was set up with roadblocks.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt further away from Zucotti Park.
In one place, policemen were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they evicted persons beyond that limit.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest event of the night took place south of the park.
Around the fifth hour of the morning, one protester was spotted south of Pine Street, as he jumped onto the hood of a police car, and several others that left the air off the tires of police van.
One minute a piece of glass came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one cop and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for release
Departments representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city. They claim that redundancies were not necessary and that they were discrimination due to a disproportionate impact on schools that visit poor students.
The Court is likely to be the last option left to trade unions in the District Council 37 in their efforts to reverse the release decision.
On October seventh, six hundred seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the most paid staff of the city. Their release from the union members described as retribution of the city for not allowing him access to the health fund managed by the work force, through which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
City leaders rejected these charges categorically.
At the meetings of the City Council held last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately insisted that there was no specific mention of the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
City leaders of District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they would call for a press conference to formally announce an action at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendant in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the prosecuting party will be eight fired workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesperson of the city's law department, said the town hasn't seen an action yet, and that's why she won't comment on the charges.
According to the draft complaint that New York Times managed to obtain, trade unions focused on the amount of those released in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct, because they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while 17 school assistants in Staten Island were not allowed at all and only in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in the district District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants and in the districts of District 8 and 9 in South Bronx were released even 46 assistants.
He recalls that public school 36 in Harlem lost five of eight assistants, although it's a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. In the lawsuit, they say, "It's not about a neighborhood full of powerful parents who can provide funds to settle the deficit in the budget."
The budget of Public School 36 was reduced by 3,26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonus finances for every student you entered.
In addition, the Departments claim that the Directors of High Schools could be confused by the way in which the document was written approving the release of parent coordinators.
The word "excess" used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of teachers from the paylist of the school to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the Central Authority.
"Six parent coordinators have been released," stands in the draft complaint, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
Mission is over, Congress is ready to take a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress agree on something about the rebellion in Libya.
However, before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States forces had to be terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on the statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rebellion and US units thank for their "state".
"This statement is what we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"For the parties of the political spectrum, they would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may have looked innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has yet been easy.
Over the years, legislators from both sides were constantly arguing with each other as well as the White House, texting a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, rejecting the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the Chamber also rejected the measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission in Libya has literally found itself in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama's mission is driving, but his members obviously did not come to support him in his beginning.
The weight of the congress has finally preceded other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and was killed by Qaddafi on October 20.
Miss Nato officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The International Relations Commission in its statement "Congratulations to the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity, which they have made in an attempt to free their people" and "the approval of the men and women of the forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in an operation for the protection of the people of Libya, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States on a successful and unreturned transition to democracy in Libya."
Will a new proposal for full support from the Commission for international relations, or will legislators be divided again into two half, as was the adoption of the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's spokesperson said on Monday that the final version of the new proposal had yet to be seen.
The House will vote this week on the amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject to which the entire House or the Senate will vote on.
For the time being, other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals towards the vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which was presented at the congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and to the Senate - and others are just small changes of others.
Only in the House can at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the starting Republicans who want to improve the reputation - can boast their "authorism".
The statement on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement to support the creation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss a limited number of periods in which members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of supplements to guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains the supplement prohibiting marriage of couples of the same sex and the supplement prohibiting the burning of the flag state.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the states face them.
Although it seems that the members of Congress are very active in designing various supplements, they do not appear to have a significant impact on average compared to previous years.
At 111. Congress offered 77 extras, while in the 100th Congress there were 66 of them.
Their activity even pales as compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last addition that was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually designed by Congress in 1789.
"A beaten but not defeated," says Gifford in his first television interview from shooting
Ten months after she was injured by the shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, she sang with melodies from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than she was going to return to Congress is worth getting better.
øfords appeared on the show "20/20" at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making theorem still makes her problems and needed help during the walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injury caused by the bullet that broke her skull in front of her, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she returned to the House surprisingly to take part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview from January shooting, during which six people were killed and other 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, describing her recovery as "serious".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, she said, "It was pretty good."
The interview with øfords and her husband, the astronaut of Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special "20/20" series, which was sent on the eve of the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gababy: A story of courage and hope".
The specialist was following the entire convalescence of zorford since the shooting of January 8th.
In the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, it's seen øfords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the entire forehead.
While her husband is encouraging her, she can't do more at that time than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, she is caught sitting in a wheelchair and teaching therapists how to do simple activities.
Kneeling head.
Sniffing lips.
And then, her first word is, "What."
In a few days, she said another word - "at" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
The videos from the ABC station show that the difficult role played by Cyndi Lauper and the "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty was played by Congressman on them.
During the interview, Pøford, who's devoted two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer's betrayed that from the day of the shooting, he doesn't remember anything.
Her husband said that she read the newspaper articles about shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who she was six, who was killed during the incident.
There's a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner who's being detained in the Mississippi prison, where he's waiting for a trial under the influence of violent medication.
"A lot of people died," said Pøfords Sawyer.
"Serious, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the convalescence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," said Kelly.
"You just got loaded.
But you can do it, you'll get back together and you'll come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops face compassion rather than respect
The event was a galaxy on Wall Street, bringing millions of dollars for war vets in New York, who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of powerlessness, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flyers and Marines around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose up and excitedly fell.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered to be heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
In addition to that, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces slightly different, was also attended at the celebration evening.
"All were introduced as some orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't an honor.
Thus, the opposite impressions merely illustrates the slight relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The military is deeply praised for its victims.
But this praise stands, the soldiers say.
The public's acting more and more, as if the individual in the uniform regrettably.
"We're not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who was commanding the troops in Iraq, leaving Afghanistan soon.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to the military commanders who don't want to look ungrateful or break up relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that had to face once returned from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of regret are passed in silence and in private between war vets.
When two sons of housed Colonel Mark Cancian came back from fighting events, where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that there would be people outside the military looking at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and admiration because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Other than that, he's gonna drill his head if "the evil, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him had no indication whether he could resist the stress associated with work in Washington as soon as he came back with the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," he taught Cancian his sons.
The army's concern is partly a source of American indifference to wars.
Successes in the battle field will rarely eliminate recognition in a country with only small awareness of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are few of its own benefits.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said General David Barno, who was commanding US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events they suffered, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to intervene hard against rape
This week will decide whether the 28 women and men against the military trial will be initiated due to alleged impoverishment in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are prepared to file an action.
The first class of the Elizabeth Lyman was the night she was reportedly raped by her army colleague, 25 years old, and was pregnant at 11 weeks.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading for the casino at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her that they might drink a little.
"In my head a warning light was lit," Lyman described.
But her native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man passed over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lymanová and 27 other existing or former military members will be waiting for the verdict of a hearing that might have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will in it determine whether the charges against the former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the army, contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed with a washington lawyer and the defendant had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish any pursuit for justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke says he's going after the neck of the highest-level military commanders, because the problem is just about to start with them.
"Armada is a direct system," he says.
"Who are people who are in a position to prevent them from introducing measures against such acts?"
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other actions brought forward in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than buying out all the charges in this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says, she will file complaints in more different cases, if it is necessary not to swallow the pressure.
A defense team is led by a U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his co-workers, gave a complaint to reject the case.
The documents from Newsweek have been detailed on the strategy of defence - in principle, it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue for injuries that have suffered as members of armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Podice injuries are related to military services of defendants," is written in the document.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially unable to serve in combat, it is only a word-screaming: in modern wars it is hard to find clearly given lines.
In the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers were increasingly important, especially in the field of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
Result: 150 female sex soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them directly in combat.
It's time for modernization to take place in the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, but she's dealing with another three legal representatives.
At Yale law school, visitors are preparing a vet seminar on legal services of the prosecution for four major military Academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere supporting hatred for women.
Independently of this non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for their action against the military. This action focuses on the diagnosis of the "failers of personality", which was allegedly found in rape to have an army of excuse for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, which belongs to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, it is a perfectly common practice.
In December, the group has already proposed an action against a State organization for negotiations with the veterans, which is accused of discriminatory practices to which aid applications were being processed by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in the Congress, presented by a group of senators and Members of both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
Three 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases and according to its own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the rate of criminal prosecution of the suspects is also broken: 20 percent of the cases reported in the army came to court in 2010 - half of them compared to the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the applicants describe attacks only as the first of many traumas.
For example, the Private First Class Lyman reported an alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it was due.
During the night, she says she has been asked to repeat her rape details 11 times to the various police, doctors and commanders.
She passed all the tests necessary to determine the rape and in her bed the blood of the attacker was found from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman graduated from a court hearing, during which she was asked questions about whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were called forward as witnesses of reputation to the alleged perpetrator who was finally released.
"I remember the day that the sentence was taken," says Lyman.
"I felt like right there at the birth site - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to visit her, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, indicating her uninclusive.
In January 2010 it was released from the army without honor, and therefore also without a claim to the service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to the next stage or not, it's a run for a long track, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stage of discussion."
But between them and the verdict there is the mentioned doctrine, which has been criticised since the first moment that the light of the world has seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their duties do not respect the same degree of motivational suggestions and discouraging measures.
He adds: "Sances are hard against them... but it is important for them to try."
The change only happens when good people are willing to fight.
If it is not decided in the hearing for their benefit, Burkevoá, the plaintiff's lawyer, he will gather hundreds of other persons willing to file an action and start working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not cease with the army on this issue to fight where the reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes early.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-Immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous derision, after which he was left in Norway 77, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time on a computer, chatted with some millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networks pages.
After this year's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy - just go Facebook.
"We realized to get them isn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of recently published news from the British research team, which concerned European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that scientists had enough to simply use the advertisement on the site and, thanks to this, completely determined the sought demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million right-wing group fans, and they have focused attention on them and sent the advertisements to them. However, instead of sending them to new groups or offering them some dietary products, they asked them to complete a questionnaire in which questions regarding the level of their education, their violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," said Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as surprising: online right-wing groups supporters are among young men, which stimulates the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "the people who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who are constantly hidden behind the screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new instrument in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering state updates, posts on walls and press-buttons "I like".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them will provide three different data daily, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. Number of academic work in which the word Facebook appears, increased from five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that he gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It was very difficult to identify them when you wanted to conduct a survey between the British National Party."
"You should get to the side where they would never let you go" says Bartlett.
"All this Facebook is tearing down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren at the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drinking output on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about it.
Moren proposes that students monitor the site and come up with a offer to help a student who publishes too many drunk status.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify threatened children that we wouldn't otherwise have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team has developed statistics on the relationship status and on the day of St. Valentine's Day, the election participation in 2010 and the coefficient of satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information they had had access to - the advocates of internet freedom have long claimed that the site should make available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the possibility of playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. On-line data is available to everyone.
"In my opinion, most users did not even think that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowlge Lab, about a study in 2006, which he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they're concerned, they only took information between them and their friends."
The question of methodology is then also considered.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that an entity is completely honest.
On Facebook there is no way to verify how much information is on the profile and contributions to the real wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two totally different things," said Selwyn.
This is why Selwin, who has spent years of research on new technologies, thinks that pen and notebook continue to remain the best tool that can be used in research.
"If you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still take place off-line."
"Chladny and Nehuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the dream of two attacks, during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of the "colds".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and between Norwegian Templar Knights," declared a court where 500 people were gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by an organization supporting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty to them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika cut off during this monologue because he didn't want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could preach his views."
For the same reason, Breivik refused to speak with him preparedly at the end of the hearing to address the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, to prohibit any contact with the media for 4 weeks and to announce that the competent authorities will have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure they were held firmly under lockdown.
They all took part in moving the case to a short closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the NRK commentator one of the survivors.
"It wasn't nice, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard a suspect, I was mentally moving a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. In both the arrival and departure of the building, without difficulty looking at the founders and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he is part of the greater movement of "response", the judge noted that he was not mad, and noted that there was no evidence of a co-workers having any.
For someone it may be comforting that attacks from June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this automatically does not reduce the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish it were a monster, but it is not," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, they began to discover the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford and elected him for his genius the greatest modern inventor.
In a recently re-occupied Jobs interview, which has been sprayed for a special film that is going to the cinema this week, Apple will be the fact that its creative mind has perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a man who makes every little bit less details - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "a real great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] among the excellent idea and excellent resulting product is a long journey of work."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on a TV series Triumph of computer freaks who discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hourly interview took place.
At that time, it has been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had his full hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he looked eagerly at how wide the public accepted the Internet.
In TV, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was finally used and the original copy of the interview was said to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly sorted, is the foundation of the 68-minute frame of Steve Jobs: The lost interview that is going to the selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has lost their desire to provide longer conversations, Jobs is acting surprisingly excited to talk about their technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview it will happen that a longer pause will occur between a question and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobs answers perfectly think about it to be the most accurate and precise.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism takes place on the surface, when Cringe’s issues are acting tirelessly and he is helping to get more quickly to more important problems and topics.
The conversation was filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone and it appeared in it until the horrific prophetic ideas when Jobs assess what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the computer technology field.
One thing is to read the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' careers, but the Jobs we see here as a eager dream in the bloom of his genius is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things could and should look like.
It didn't take long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to bring them into practice.
Quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is definitely worth noticing:
How he learned to manage the business:
"In the future of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about business stuff.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe its efforts to simplify Apple accounts.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the term "standard cost", their height could only be thought out. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs within a while.
How he made the rosary on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modro box" that he built up with Steve Wozniak, a device that enabled people to hack into a phone company effectively and call free of charge anywhere in the world.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when Blue Box describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
He explains how Wozniak and Wozniak tested their devices using a paid phone and they got transferred from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible during the call.
"At least half a dozen times we got mixed up around the world like this, so when we screamed into a paid phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs is laughing.
"We were young, and we found out that we could build something that is capable of managing an infrastructure for billions of dollars all over the world."
We made ourselves a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think Apple would never have been able to make it without it.
Jobs continued with a description of the prank that Wozniak almost reached the end. In the middle of the night, the Blue Box called to Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, giving as best possible delivery as Henry Kissinger.
In the middle of the night, they were called to talk to the U.S. diplomats, and only just before the Popes woke up to the phone themselves, the couple would show off and lay down the headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build a kmitometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett on his phone and called him.
After their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a guaranteed summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at that time that made my view of what this company was and how to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was as big as the trunk, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager at HP, I was going up and up, hanging around that computer, and I started writing programs for him.
How she makes up innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how they make new products at a time.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with printed connections, one customer asked him to put together the entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled and delivered the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he remembers the problems that they faced in the development of computer mice:
"I remember when we had a pretty wild fight... they yelled at me that it would take five years [set a mouse that would cost $300] when it stopped talking to me, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big the company breathes:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foretelled that many industrial leaders in their vision would fail and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that point, there's a lot of money and marketing, so companies are in charge of the people who are in charge of this, while people who care about their own products are out of the decision-making process.
Technology genius, which society has led to its unshakable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could've been ten times bigger than she is, could've been Microsoft's '90s...
But instead of winning, they earned money to lose.
How he takes innovation as a form of art:
"It has a great idea and excellent resulting product is a long journey and a lot of work... and how that great idea develops and it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to come to a whole range of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force you to.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to reflect them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to rob the best ideas.
Macintosh was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and according to circumstances also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd be able to do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the law on health care at the time of their case
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind the closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether he would object to the law on medical treatment of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a conference dinner sponsored by a law firm to participate in the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases in question was the prosecution of 26 states questioning radical re-processing of healthcare, which last year approved Congress - a law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action, but in March it is expected to hold 5,5 hours of negotiations, the outcome of which will also develop even more presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be fully current at the time of the 2012 decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to achieve the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as General Prosecutor of the United States under the government of George W. Bush.
Clean law firm Bancroft PLLC was one of almost two dozen companies to help sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner group, which has been dealing with the defence of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held in the Washington Hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
He participated, among other things, also Mitch McConnell, the Supreme Representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the display of guests, Scalia and Thomas.
It's not new: This couple of judges have been involved in the Federal Society's actions for years.
And it's definitely not even about anything that's contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct that are subject to a lower federal judge.
However, if this were not the case, it would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently related and other organisations organising for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorable guest, nor be placed on the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two law firms active in the case, as well as to companies with great financial interest in this case, was rich enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference against the code of conduct is contrary to the statement of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules as for all the other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Case.
"The judges drank and had dinner at community benefit together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and help in the acquisition of funds through this action undermines the feet by all claims of unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed their critics a little understanding, and they showed them that they also had no problem combining their legal obligations with groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for President Obama's government when there were first objections against the law.
The Kaga's criticism is pushing her to renounce participation in the case, and she claims that she fought for the law so much as she can now be uninhabited.
Kagan had no indication that she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record contract for the current aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Aerolinks Emirates order 50 cable current planes Boeing 777 with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six aircraft Boeing Dreamliner airline Aman Air, for which more than USD 1 billion is spent.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is a manufacturer of aircraft Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is together a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important is how Boeing obtained the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to forecasts issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced her biggest order this weekend in history with regard to dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 dual current Boeing 777.
A sensational order came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Trade Fair, Dubai Air Show has reported that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contract to reach $26 billion.
On Monday then Boeing announced that Oman Air's airline had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of the much better fuel consumption and passengers' equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole company Boeing," said Neal Dihor, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to those countries that benefit oil.
This means that they have not only money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly harmful airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so decisive because the country alone makes money on higher oil prices.
This is important because it is not as likely as other airlines that they could paralyze or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihor.
"They have such natural protection," she says.
The Arab Emirates Aeroline Agreement strengthens Boeating’s leading position on the wide-bodied aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to its narrow company, which tried to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus's representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft will take place, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER aircraft.
The withdrawal was due to the fact that customers required more useful aircraft loads and flights, so the manufacturer took time to deliver more engine power.
Boeing Co-action Price increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The Mexican President's sister seems to have been defeated in the michoac elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped in pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
It seems that Felipe Calderon's sister, in violent government elections, lost the governor's post in Michoacán, later stated on Monday, that one of her opponents helped the drug traffickers to win.
Preliminary results have been awarded to Faust Vallelei, Governorial Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Mikoacán, but for our country," said Luis Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion polls... confiscated electoral urns, built roadblocks... and let people vote on the PRI order.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico seven decades until 2000, when it lost its Presidency.
However, he plans to return to power and win the elections in Mikoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI site hopes to win in July in presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo beat Calderon, who had led the day before the elections, only very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallelon as a winner.
The third place was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-hand Democratic Revolution Party, or a PRD which had been in charge of the Governor's office until now. For the disputed and sadly persecuted party, it is against the presidential elections in 2012 about a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state, named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and metamphetamines.
It is the birth state of President Calderon and it is in Michoacán in December 2006 that he has launched a military fight against the captors.
But violence endured.
Mayor of the PAN, supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered only one week before the election and many candidates from the election left out of fear.
However, however, the results of elections in Michigan look for the PRI side in any way, the victory of the party will help to get a new impulse.
The expected PRI party in presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neto, from Wahington Vallei congratulated and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging for the coming year."
Bank ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
Asian Development Bank invited India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise a global decline that would have a negative impact on Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the Bank of Manila, said that two emerging economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the States of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] all European difficulties are watching "too uninterrupted" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and means would help bless the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So everybody who could help Europe out of the crisis has said to the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but she's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have increased dangerously and both Italy and Greece's Prime Ministers have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised concerns about the fact that the global economy could withdraw again into recession, and calls for the emerging frontal economies to join and help Europe to find solutions.
Mr Nag foretold that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds of the Fund of financial assistance from the European Union, the institution for European financial stability - would give more negotiating opportunities to the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do what she can," to help Eurozone because her own economy is now suffering from a drop in export and a breath of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a naked fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as Indians, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be very difficult to explain aid to Europe 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"One might find that the Greeks retire in 50s and enjoy holidays on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, the Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well paid employment for many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag pointed out that the Eurozone crisis threatens "a dangerous dominance effect".
The Bank's prediction that between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of the economic growth will now face the "reduction risk" due to European threats.
It stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unforeseeable expenditure plans" in order to protect them from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economy.
Warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the defence area
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta attached the boiler to Congress Monday when he warned that the drawing automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and cause a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion reduction in the budget over the next ten years, but it is now concerned with a reduction of USD 600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called suspension will result in 23% of the flat-rate decline and many new projects being stopped.
"You cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships because of the enormous reduction used in this indisputable way," Pantta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our army and seriously harm its readiness."
Finally, the cuts will be touched by combat forces, announced by Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations in overseas do not touch directly, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," said Pantto.
"There will be cuts in the contractual staff, which will result in delays in the contracts agreed to support the war effort of our people."
"The situation of paid staff will be reduced, including late payments to suppliers and subsequent legal and political interference."
Both Senators wrote Panette down ten days ago and asked him for details on possible consequences on automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a strike at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the sight of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The cuts charged are a threat to the United States national security, which we should not allow."
"Now we will see whether Panette's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and strengthen the voices calling for leaving the Pentagon from the list of decomposed areas.
Panetta has been more and more open recently in talks about possible cuts, although he has moved himself to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a rigid struggle.
At the press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his resort might expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a boat without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"He'll be like an Air Force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of casinos, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete a mission," said Panetta at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"He will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the Annex, the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta specify how the reduction will result in "a clear operational risk: a late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of plantings and deployment around the world; an unacceptable risk expected in future fighting operations."
In addition, Pantta added that some of the biggest defence projects could expect to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in early planning stages.
The list included, for example, the project of the F35 aircraft, the planned new bomber, the ballistic subs of the new generation, the new coastal fighting ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, which wanted to replace the army and the marine crew.
By stopping further development and testing of aircraft F35, 80 billion dollars would be saved in the next ten years, but its advocates claim that this is a necessary further step in the improvement of the army, which needs to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A light view of recent headlines suggests how serious and omnipotent lies and deceptive in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full on the charge that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other side is lying.
The administrators at Penn State were charged with false testimony trying to hide records of the fact that a trained football coach sexually attacked a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling the American President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lie could destroy the entire careers and cloud the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately turned away by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the finances from his campaign to try to hide his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus, which snuck around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period of his sexual invasion with Monica Levinski.
It's just stories about cheating at school and university everywhere.
There are cases when teachers give their students test answers just to make them look good in their own opinions.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending messages that lie and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show you'll lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases on one day.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers failed three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
The determination of lies, or the "restraint of lies", is an essential skill that everyone should adopt, whether for personal or working reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, the charade, when a person shouts out, "I have you." The dissolution of deception is a serious industry of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old lies myths have been thrown out.
The liars are still looking into your eyes.
It's not like they're snooping, cocktails, red or crazy.
However, do not take advantage of the fact that it is somehow difficult to detect and reveal a liar.
The trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the religious construction, minor expression in the face, the way in which questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and developing sector related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's difficult world can help you - especially if your work is part of hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them plow in their vigilance, guide their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men putting more "serious" lies, while women say more lies to others - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that women are lying less often to their partners than to the free people (all lies they say are "irregular").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
That's called computer observation.
He's going to have later findings to compare it to.
Note the body's possession, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone normally constantly knocks his legs so that you don't properly blame him for lying just because the middle of the meeting begins to tap his legs.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and non-vertebral behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lies.
People who tell lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their dream story, they can turn the tip of the shoe to the door, move to the east, significantly change the body's possession or show a "left after the interview" - overreached shortness of breath and change of position when there is a difficult confession behind them.
People doing interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see how the relief will look after it ends.
Also take the language of the subject.
The famous story is about how Scott Peterson once overcame and used the last time when he claimed his murdered woman was alive, which ran a national search for her body.
Lying individuals can also express themselves in proportion: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Levinski" or the difficult question will repeat.
The most common verbal characters are only very small.
Someone can use a lot of "predominant language" when they answer a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness."
In that response we don't know too much facts, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no magic that would go away to reveal every lie, but it is possible to adopt the skills that lie can be taught.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not going to a liar and a cheater in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipe will be redirected after the threat of postponement of approval by the US government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus sending unions against each other, but calming down the environmentalists - a company that has the construction of the pipeline to care announced that it is willing to redirect the project in order to put things in motion again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would be approved as well.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the non-Brandian government.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
This announcement came after the Foreign Ministry reported last week that it postpones a decision on the federal authorisation of the project, where it did not conduct a study of possible replacement routes, which could not be affected by the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogalla water layers, a large underground water supply plant.
"This is really a shift forward," said Republican deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental opinion ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably put aside any decision until 2013, i.e. the year after the next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
Obama described the decision in a written statement last week as a request from the State Department and expressed his support to him.
1 700 miles of long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert's province to refineries in Texas, he eats 700 000 barrels of oil daily.
6 states will need to go this way.
This project completely hates environmentalists, but it's loved by work nets that estimate 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and into the watery layer of Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and irrigating.
The ongoing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the General Inspector from the Ministry ordered a new examination of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
It was once whether the lobbyist acquired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not present a conflict of interest in the programme.
The next was whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriate because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up fear for her
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's singer was angry at their Manhattan home and scared their daughter so much that she had a little bit of fear.
The performance of the singer "Lady Marmalade" spooked her 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "the change of personality, sleep disorder" and "the increased fear of strangers," claims her family in action brought to Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th of last year, Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monková gathered the luggage down to their house in the Riverside Boulevard and carried it with him and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a while and put her baby away for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "yes" and I went out to pick her up."
LaBelle, a pregnant woman, had a horribly mutilated.
"An aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter on the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - loudly screaming out the simplest terms...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started puking water from me.
He says Genevieve got her hysteric attack.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." said the mother of the child.
LaBelle's mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw her away and had to stop her escort, who then pulled her back to the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter was yelling so much when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle requested an apology, but no answers were received.
The lawyer and spokesman LaBelle are not responding to our calls to express themselves to the whole story.
The prosecution calls for a closer indeterminate compensation, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family was planning to devote all the money to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The objective is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her beginnings," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old in his arms."
Climate change has lifted the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdez grew unemployment and inconsistencies, foreign investment and economics decreased.
The year 2011 is signed into Sinaloa's economic history. This is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, which is called the Government of Change. This government has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and there has even been a decline in the main economic development indicators.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth opportunities of the state economy, have a fall in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there was an historical decline of 31.16%, which affected the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of the treated soil, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state has increased to 5,28% during the first three quarters. Between January and March, 55,053 inhabitants of the Sinaloa State were unemployed, which represents a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, average unemployment grew further and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly on the basis of the steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnessing an increasing unemployment which is related to various factors, among other things, a loss of liquidity on the market due to a reduction in resources due to the legislation which the Congress has approved in the fight against money laundering. For people who are illegally forced to pay, it is not easy to invest or use them," he stressed.
Migration stop
López Cervantes stated that demographic factor is also involved in increasing unemployment.
"The number of persons who are going abroad to work in the United States has fallen, however, for reasons of difficult entry, and then also because although they get abroad, it is hard for them to get a job. People remain and demand work from our state, and unemployment is growing," he said.
Incompatibilities
The analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is also aggravated due to the growing inconsistencies that prevail in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed people in the State work without serving social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and non-reliability. In this administrative territory there are the lowest wages from all over the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Labour and Social Planning Secretariat.
The average monthly income in the country of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesset, deep below the national average, which moves to 7,375 peset.
Reduction of direct foreign investment
With the decline in economic activity and unemployment, in 2011, direct foreign direct investment has also been recorded for the past 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment in the period from January to June reached $630 697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of $5 143 312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development presents investments of 17 280 million pesset per year. These investments were mainly directed to service businesses.
Debt
In the context of the decline scenario, the government of this state asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to reinvigorating the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso. By November, no profits were recorded from debt, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdés, pointed to the lack of government control capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no reconciliation of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We must work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012, we need to double our efforts, the harmonisation of our efforts and in particular the proper and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better", he said.
Growth in the economy
Loredo López stated that events like a cold at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and reduced its growth and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, among other things by freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover sufficiently quickly so that the dynamics could be restored to achieve an acceptable level of process movement, products and services.
Re-determining of mission
According to Teodore Salazar Uriart, President of the Employment Committee of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In the present case, we observe that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilise all potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work that is ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of identifying a vision for the future, which would better guide the efforts of the government.
"I would now say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to establish a long-term plan", he said.
He stated that the current administration showed progress in terms of public policy management.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is a vision of work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Sentenced in 8 kg marijuana
The resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He has been condemned for a crime of health threats, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army forces on 7 June 2010 at a meeting in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the station 80 in El Castillo district, Navolato.
Dealer went in a van like pick up white color, and in the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a passenger seat a small backpack. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, a man has remained available to the Judges of the second department and proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal consequences of crimes.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Hábitat, Public Places Rescue and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to an end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Head of Urban Social Development has said that if construction work has been ahead so far, it now threatens that the government will not be able to provide adequate supplies which require more than 11 million peso resources on three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state is estimated to be 25%. Only the Federation and the city have added the funds until then, so it is possible that the project will be delayed in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to secure nearly 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we have got nothing at all. And even though we should have got a part in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started projects and continued very apparently, but we are short of money".
He stated that last year during the management of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to ask for a loan so that it could pay more than 7 million which the State administration had given them.
"The present thing has happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs go on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to obtain funds that would cover what the state did not end," explained.
In spite of the fact that there is a promise from the state officials concerning the transfer of these resources, he said that the request was sent to the Secretary for Administration and Finance to speed up the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"We should have been given 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso."
The Court of Justice endorses the 'consistent of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action put forward by the Senate and the Chamber of Chamber against the Presidential Decree, which wanted to speed up the so-called "interference of analogic signals" in 2015 instead of 2021.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he published a decree in which individual steps are given to move to the Earth's digital television.
With this result, the action lodged by the Senate was rejected, because the qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to comment on the constitutionality or integrity of the mentioned decree, which thus remained valid.
The proposal of the judgment drawn up by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree unstoppable, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which, under law, is reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in order to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therein leading to the transition to digitisation.
The Council of Ministers also decided to reject the action filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the proposal, which also has the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that it did not identify the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal eclectivator could not structure a measure through general standards to prepare a public administration.
"I do not think that, even if she did, this would be affected by the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal eclectivity which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of digital analogic signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is believed that to delay the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation which requires decisions in matters of public interest. Digitalization does not have only a technical dimension, but also "it concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "require the operation of the whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already stopped the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to issue an unacceptable decree, which, to a certain extent, interferes with the sphere of competence of the Congress, to introduce in the area of administration compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michigan, they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by vote"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's elections is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of adding "voice after vote" appeared in this year's elections in Mikoacán, where, in line with the figures published by the programme of preliminary electoral results (PREP), the difference between the first and the second place in the Governor's elections was less than 27 percent, the votes of 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts have not yet been drawn.
In this context, the President-General of the Election Institute in Michigan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán officially has not confirmed its political constitution or its State electoral code or the Law on electoral justice. The State Congress has approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this parliamentary period and Governor Leonl Godoy Rodgel has already mentioned their publication within the time limit set in the Official Journal of the State in question.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) solved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the voice of the Head of State in the area of constitutional reforms "unauthorized and illegal" as it had no right to "not to approve nor to invest".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it will be possible for the local electoral authority to carry out the partial and total census.
In this way, the partial allocation of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the electoral results do not agree; there is no entry for the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant fields or the chairman is not available; or if there has been errors and a clear violation of the electoral results.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all electorations will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is a explicit request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition which proposed the candidate in the second place at the beginning of the meeting.
The overall recalculation of votes will also be possible when, after proper reading, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is a clear request from the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place. In that case, the electoral packages for which partial compilation has been carried out will be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is a choice in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and the second place less than 0.16%, although it has not yet been included 129 of the total 923 electoral districts.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Mount Zapalnam, confirmed by his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his home town. During Monday, there will be a ceremony and a convent mass.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish that his ashes would be scattered in the Mount of Zapalnam.
After having been killed in an accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to Coahuila's capital on board the Mexican air force. Family and closest friends took part in a ceremony on Campo Marte.
At noon, the Colonel's ashes arrived in a chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m. there was a separation at the Technology Institute in Saltillo, which organized his former classmates from technology high school and members of the American football team Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes should be scattered in the Mount of Zapalnam. Thus he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and joined the Collegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some of them didn't believe it because they said he even drove the truck, but he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávała Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "so he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to the promotion of his uncle, which is why he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: driving a plane.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, the Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we have said goodbye to all the virtues that he had come to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he avoided both the study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died on the past days after the helicopter that was driving. On board was also the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and other six persons, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Salesian native Bacio Cortés (sealed) arrived in order to be transmitted through burial service by Mexican air forces under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez at the Prostratation, where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned bodies on Cadereyta NL ship were found.
Several hours before the findings, the military officials presented 11 persons who were detained in this area for crimes connected with organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body, and the head was found on an abandoned vessel by Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The road from Cadereyta to Santiago was found at a distance of 1.5 km, known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the cabin with the bejax-chain fence had opened the door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed three people's corpses, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person wore a sports T-shirt of yellow colours and dark cotton pants and was not a shoe. He also had a man lying next to him in a sports shirt with white strips.
A few meters further there was a body of another person dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were face-to-face.
According to data obtained at places, all three people were probably killed elsewhere because bullets were not found.
There were reports addressed by one group of organized crime and also a number of bullet marks, both in the construction and on the door.
11 suspects have been arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defence Secrets introduced 11 people, including youths, who were members of the criminal group, who operated mainly in the field of Cadereyt and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first attempt on 11 November, 8 people were detained in the Los Alveros colony and one person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were provided. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, 6th, the military staff was at the Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, when he noticed cars without the SPZ and in it two people.
After stopping the car, they carried out a search and discovered a rifle, a shell, and 18 rounds.
Then, on November 13, about 14 hours, one of the Complicators in La Frauda was detained. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the abyss of economic disasters.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the abyss of the economic disaster and which has put the entire euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace published a report in which he announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet President Giorgio Napolano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed of the technocratics, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would introduce the results of his interviews with the political parties in order to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage", said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti clearly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, which is much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling to combat the political and financial crisis, which has increased to an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a hard package of cost-efficient measures that require European leaders. Only so, it will be possible to restore Italy’s ruined credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry. Due to market instability, BTP’s interest in the Italian bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percentage points is exceeded, the level that Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marceglia, President of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, said to the journalists after a meeting with Montem: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity to get Italy out of this pressing situation.
Monte's hope of success has significantly multiplied thanks to PDL's support of Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are for good results," she told the journalists Angelina Alfano, the secret of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because up until now, a number of its members stood up against the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is building up.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong Parliament support so that it can promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could create a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The wheel of the negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, who made a very rapid response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi will demission, the interest of Italian bonds has returned to the critical border and thus react to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
To save Italy whose public debt is at EUR 1.8 trillion would be beyond the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should stand by power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecast that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said that she would like to include policies in her cabin, but the great parties insist that this government must only be composed of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties in which the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political resources have indicated that bilateral distrust and disapprovals between the parties make efforts to involve both government and political personalities.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricarians
Of 22 Spanish football players ten outnumber 50 international matches.
On Costa Rica, only one of 22 elected players reached the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on Costa Rica's side if we compare 22 players of both countries who are today at a friendly game at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the masters of the world and Europe, the number of one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of class A intermediates, Costa Rica has only defenseman Michael Uman, who played 50 international games as the only one.
This was the number that reached last Friday in the match against Panama ↑2) at the stadium Rommel Fernández.
Spanish football players, who play in the Uprising of the stars and in powerful clubs of the first league, maintain intensive activity over a year on league championships and home cups and high-level matches within the European Cups as Champions League.
We must also add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches at European and world championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited possibilities of foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, who is considered to be the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation has on its end the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday in front of England (ref. 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also come up against Costa Rica today and receive a new record for Spain - 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his end.
Casillas and Xavi were officially announced last week by UEFA together with other Spanish players who had 100 matches at their end. Among them already mentioned Zubizarret with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The hundreds are close to Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
They follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres s 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uman, the left wing Junior Díaz moves with 48 matches and the goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 exceeded the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azopheifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of games.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are held.
On the national side with less than 30 matches costs Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba Two, in Kostarice Moretor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of the 20 years of existence
"Cesta on Costa Rica is a dream that becomes real"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bass player Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself makes sure that they can play Costa Rica for them is a fulfilled dream.
This is how the bass player and the founding member Jeff Ament spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the context of a tour on the occasion of twenty years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day comes out from 7:30 a.m. at the National Stadium along with the The X angelic group and the National musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a demonstration from an interview whose entire transcript you will find on La Nación's website on the Internet.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The way to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes real.
In South and Central America, we are barely twice and experience has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love a group here, fans spend these days preparing very intensely.
What do you say to your most beautiful supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this cause a lot of pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we have performed in the last 21 years have been in the range of several weeks.
We've done some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope we've got into a form for a concert at Costa Rica.
In fact, we look forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going surfing on Costa Rica or to Nicaragua or Mexico, and that's the best place for surfing, and so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We'll try to show the best show with various songs. We'll try to play some songs from every album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, which is why it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we also have a surprise, because we remember why we liked so much and that we might have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
You celebrate this tour for 20 years of art.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could imagine being in one big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we've been given and we're concerned that we can continue to play together.
We like each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to have a look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were a major part of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which they are represented by themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen much.
From time to time, the group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to come from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes some of us are still playing.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for the group like yours to keep together and after these years still have the same members.
Yes, the four of us have joined us for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) 13 years ago, which itself is a much longer time than the normal duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world and secondly playing our role in the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find a balance?
By growing up, it was increasingly easier to find a balance.
We're trying not to take too much tour because it's very easy to fall into this crowd trap and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you have to have music and what you gave her, to respect, not to be carried away by being famous rock stars.
How do you remember Mother Love Bone's next project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something grand.
We existed as a band for three years, and we never released any album until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed about it. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss him so much.
National band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as prefaced?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group most. Therefore we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always live to change the words Yellow Ledbether?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first one to attack it.
Who's affecting you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about bass players I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though she's no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt very easily separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were created at the same time. And if this is even so valid today, it's something great because it's music worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney playing better music than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly deceptive character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that there are a few songs in the new album, which are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breethe, which are considered to be very glamorous, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're very, very dark.
I think that if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or your friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still do a scaly music.
Peru:
Fujimori was once again hospitalized due to medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he was tested because of muscle loss in the area of lower limbs, he informed his physician.
72 years old Fujimori, who has been serving 25 years of prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operated four times and already have doctors under control.
Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, said to the television station Canal N that Fujimori will be tested in three days at the National Institute of neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in the lower limbs.
Aguanaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could have received grace for humanitarian reasons, but the former president does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was four times operated because of his tongue cancer, dropped 18 pounds of weight, and these problems were added to these problems as heavy erosive gastritis, cysts on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circumference problems in his legs, defined by a doctor.
Fujimori has been serving punishment since September 2007, at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murdering squad of the troops acting illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start on Tuesday by Mexico. Its objective is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political themes of the region.
The Mujica meets its Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón. It is the most important meeting of extensive visits to a full meeting with political representatives, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", published the Uruguayan Presidential Office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Caldeń to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy has included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French town of Cannes.
In Sarkozy's speech, he threatened that the countries that continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community.
The G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world, with the Latin American countries mentioned on January this year, an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been working to specify the agreements on fiscal exchange with a view to getting out of the 'black list' of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation (OECD) to which countries which have not introduced all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view of Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has enhanced the exchange of goods between the two countries.
A bearded installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach of Bowser's evilsters, but he has never shown up in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all stores around the world was already created from the beginning to use all the characteristics that offer a portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how to function without glasses", said a press worker specialising in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game developed specifically for this carrier", because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo said that besides the 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth batch.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simplified", whose task is to attract less skillful users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go to the "second round" at the levels of the game, which are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "do not be subject to optical trick".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D presupposes the return of the figure to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this videoplay, Nintendo plays into a note to those who follow the saga and repeats a successful formula from previous parts. It consists in the fact that the installer of a bearded man will have to go through dangerous dominated platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, nearby, in disguises and amongst enemies, there is also a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps on the issue of former President Alfons Portilla, who was supposed to answer from the conspiracy in the United States for the purpose of washing 70 million US dollars.
This concludes a process aimed at having Guatemala answer to the request of the Northern Country requiring Portilla to judge him.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of judicial and executive powers and that he had in mind that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he did not "introduce" in court decisions and allowed all the editions he had received on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and severe health harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colom's step is a step in eclection after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and it will be guaranteed to respect human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of embezzlement of 120 million in the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry called back and returned to play.
Trinejov helped 6,000 young people in a state of threat
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not be present at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of social support organization Trinejov has been very important: 6.000 young people who have threatened social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them over 25 years to overcome difficult situations.
To this end, a long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group should be added.
Last anniversary was also used to introduce balances in the framework of the event, which took place in former production premises of Fabra and Coats, which took part in more than 300 people.
Trinje’s organization was established in Trinitat Vella in 1986 with a view to helping young people with low education, without working, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Last night's meeting in Sant Andrea took part in a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions who have cooperated with association over the last 25 years.
A variety of political representations, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trineňov.
In conjunction with President Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended former socialist education advisers, Ernest Maragall, and former mayors and current environmentalist councillor Ricard Goma.
In the large Fabra and Coats hall, there were also present counsellors for social well-being and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general social director at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mass said that Trinejov was created in a very difficult time and that today's time also presents a number of obstacles, but he added that the work the Association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President put Trineniov as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he does, nothing new", he said.
There was an eviction of a taken house where there were giant parties
The aliens owned 11 out of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 Redeemers left the house at noon yesterday without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors living on number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people left the building illegally and organized by the giant parties that were built by the neighbors, leaving the building out of court without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to avoid repeating the situation.
"From this moment on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The shoppers who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - they took all electrical and partly and water equipment, but they painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans for alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
There's a disco next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press, that during the time when the building was occupied, sales were down by 80%.
The disco owner points out that the shoppers of the building made her an unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while she costs 10 on disco.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to react to complaints by neighbors because of noise. However, the problems were not caused by visitors to discotheque, but by residents of the taken house, and especially those who participated in organized parties, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the surroundings.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed to the building owner and for nine months left her rent.
City police also confirmed that over the last few weeks, she had received more complaints from the neighbors about the situation.
President of the City Group of the People's Party to the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested last week that "the building be immediately evicted and put to an end to the problems of civil association that the neighbours suffer and the destruction of the area".
The People's President explained that only one floor was taken a summer ago, but in the last few months the shopkeepers got into all the floors of the building and almost all the flats and in one of them even there was theft.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent with the effects of the civil liability in the building".
Yesterday the city police also cleared out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after the neighbors who saw her enter the building of four people.
All four of them were stopped immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the process, which carries more than a polemic on the honoraries.
The 16 gate city invitation to tender opens again the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, in the time of the largest bloom of the already disappeared Corporateación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-containment printed several pamflets to support Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalán metropolis is one of the few, which is not oriented to the north - south, but up (hore) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone and the savages instead of the Yoga bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall declared a mega competition of 16 competitions on the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate is recording rather the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put a gate in the field.
So one question is Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational terms and on the basis of the reflection of the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already as sharp as the two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator.
And that's what created one of the rare connections between what the three Barcelona architects think and the most presumptuous university professors.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayon: the selection procedure has its merit.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf Party began, "it is necessary" to discuss also the "Horry side", so Ildefons Cerda's speech about green apples was not added to the end.
"We have to be based on the principle that the beach is the brightest of Barcelona park.
Among other things, it's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex, said the architect, for whom the name "broni do Collserola" has a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "like entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of a zone where it is possible to operate".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona, has qualified the experience of urbanism as an "intellectual challenge" with some dangers.
The dangers arising from the "insecurity that today is a project of public places" following the experiences of the 1980s, which in the Forum's "my swant singing".
The first fear is the definition of the border where it should be built.
"Something to define is to take another step", it is essentially to move forward.
"It is necessary to keep in mind new urbanistic and planning tools, because these current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus more specifically on the question, the Modol considers that Collserola’s high level can be " considered as a park", but not the Barcelona section, for reasons of purely topographic.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "must end in the trash" even though he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its gremium that it will hit the project from "first moment".
In addition, it understands that the proximity of the mountains and the cities is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but it "disputs" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", adding) which is to be created: "Architekti should be only tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question given by the name of this game is complicated, because in the background for the selection procedure there is a lack of global vision Collserola: "It was declared 16 selection procedures that deal with all axes of the mountains - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least him to log in for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, a project of one gate can be based on a concept and definition of a neighbouring gate architect.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino missed Jonas Larazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal agent Cadino Red granted his mercy to the Mayor of Monterrey in a process in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larzabal spent 72 days in prison and now he will be released after the legal agent Casino Red granted his mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the district under discussion of an extortion case in which the Mayor's brother was accused of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos that Manuel Jonas was supposed to ask him to pay the economic quota to enable the town hall in Monterrey to allow illegal operation in the betting house.
Following a public prosecution, the state prosecutors started a criminal prosecution of the Panist Mayor's brother. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours of spending in front of the Public Ministry Agent 3, he was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
The following 49 days left after the second arrest order had been launched and the Public Ministry agent had turned away the possibility of participating or organised crime.
On October 19th, he was taken to a criminal court in Cadereyt to suspect extortion of Casin Red's owners with one and a half million peso. However, he remained in prison for only a few hours with moderate supervision because he was threatened by death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the town complex in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, a warrant was submitted to him for arrests issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that almost two months after the investigation, there were sufficient evidence to prove that Jonas was guilty.
This Monday, the legal agent of Casina Red, Mr Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy to the mayor of the region. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to his freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage was repaired and who decided to grant mercy from his associates. The lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
Based on the official file 197/2011, legal mercy of Jonas Larrazábal is awarded. In a trial that was taken against him, no complaint will be possible. There is also no way to claim compensation for damage or punishment.
Following a trial with a legal agent about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazbal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, came to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza, to notify Jonas that he was granted official grace and his case was postponed to the archives.
He also announced that the judge issued an immediate order for his release.
Dionisao Pérez Jacome presented details of the air accident in which the Governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, died, and the other seven persons.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora died and seven other persons show that the helicopter fell directly on the ground with force without the pilot having the chance to attempt forced landing.
At the Dioniso Pérez Jácome Press Conference, the Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot noted that the air conditions of flight permit.
"The crowds that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have been locked into the tree branch 25 meters from where the unit has lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, therefore meeting all requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground following an investigation in the field of impact.
"When searching, it was found that parts of the plane were not found elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at present it is most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of airports and auxiliary services, declared that the helicopter of the Presidential Staff was on a trip speed and the accident occurred on a soft rising terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that during the accident it was a normal air traffic operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome named six basic points of investigation:
Visual years:
According to air standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means the crew must be seen on the ground during the flight.
Meteor conditions:
The AICM reports shall state the adequate starting conditions, in accordance with this aircraft moving towards the border, between DF and Mexico, and the State of Mexico were seen to be frozen in low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouded crew, she was searching for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavac valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recordings of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disturbance of flight pathways prior to impact.
Deployment of aircraft residues into restricted territory:
The information we are currently available allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a straight tracker and side.
The drawing of the dispersion of the rest of the aircraft indicates that at the time of impact on the mainland he was a full helicopter.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the site of disaster that evidenced an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that several land-based contacts could have been made.
During the field works, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9900 feet above sea level, the terrain is considered to go from seven to 30 degrees above.
Photographs show images likely to have broken down along the route mentioned above.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that a helicopter could get into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the area of an accident, no remains of a helicopter were found in the territory that was more extensive than the territory of the extermination, which strengthens the presumption that the helicopter had been in a state of emergency.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute has launched a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health leads research in order to discover a gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) has announced that it leads research to reveal a gene for obesity in children and young people. The research called "Obses of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow for overweight results.
In the report of the Head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of Biochemistry of Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was set up.
This team is based on support for specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to participants in the IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where they will be every group from 8 hours of youth tests.
He stressed that research began at the Cuahtém Sports Centre (Mexican State) and since October 8, this activity was also carried out in the Sports Center of Náhualcoyolt (The East of the Mexican State).
As soon as data is obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sport Center (also from the Federal District) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Centre (norther than the Federal Centre).
He explained that the objective of this research is to identify the ingredients and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace on Mexican children and young people the risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3 000 children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He stated that all participants are in anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and gene testing (to identify genes that are involved in the formation of child obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming increase in child weight.
'A healthy survey between 1999 and 2006 showed that only six years later, a 77% increase in obesity occurred in boys and 47% in girls. A dramatic increase occurred also in case of overweight', an IMSS expert said.
He said that one of the reasons for finding indicators is that the population of the country differs from other populations its genetic history.
He informed that average Mexican has 65% American-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact reflects in genes that are responsible for the formation of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general obesity genetics are commonly explained as inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive a total assessment of the status of children, thereby finding out whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He indicated that even the presence of a precipitation of dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and the forearm suggests the probability that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-circular conditions.
The information is confidential so far, the doctors hand it over to their parents in writing and explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles that have to be done to avoid their children’s diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sitting way of life representing a lack of daily physical activity, full-day sitting before television and using means of transport instead of walking within a short distance.
Overweight also causes a large caloric intake, it is greater consumption of fried beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic loads that are subject to this research.
There will be no excavities in the asphalt of the UNAM.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture of having better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature.
If it was properly taken care of pavement, it would not need to be repaired by nearly 200,000 volts after each rain season in the Metropolitan region of Valle de México, pointed out by Rafael Herrera Najera, a researcher from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphaltads were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of the extortions, or even it could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technology Cause of Exams, which he made during the International Year of Chemicals, announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified polymer asphaltes, thereby creating a mixture of similar characteristics such as asphalt, but also more mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country. It would improve functionality and reduce the formation of discards.
He explained that asphalt, the most severe part of oil, is the group of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weights called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weights called maltenses. Together, they supply the asphalt typical vis-elastic character.
Viscoelastic nature of asphalt consists of high temperatures, about 180 degrees, acting as fluid, at 120 degrees has high viscose and at 50 degrees it is almost in solid state, while at low temperatures it tends to melt, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, alerted the expert on chemical engineering.
The researcher at the Faculty of Chemicals observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México were covered with flexible tiles, which form six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers there is an asphalt insert, made up of small pebbles covered in asphalt and then compressed.
He pointed out that every stone that forms an insert is an asphalt.
When driving through cars or creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the floor to spread well.
If it was a modified asphalt, they'd spread even better, he believes a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer of the cloth is placed on the asphalt insert, which is made of fine stone, i.e. sand also covered in asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the vehicle handle, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and have to ensure the friction of the vehicle.
Since a large load will be placed as part of the flow, the coat must have sufficient thickness and must be careful of the material from which it is produced.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the function of asphalt inserts.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes the softening of all the layers of the tiles and thus the formation of the springs.
He explained that during the formation of the springs the film was the first to destroy the coat and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a slowly process to stop already at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of springs and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the loads of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not exceed. Only so we can prevent frequent generation.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that, as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries, and allow for easy fixing of the output without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna's not getting Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multimission.
Valle del Cauca has not reached Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramírez Serena had to be satisfied with the fact that she found herself on the floor of the winner, gained a silver crown and a sash, based on which she became the new first multimission of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of last year's finals in Cartagena, in which she won and was taken by Miss Atlántico, the mentioned department received the 14th title of the first multi-mission. Melina joined the crowds of the women from Valle del Cauca, who received the winning crown, but eventually received the first multi-mission. Among them were Miriam Ospin Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselles Aljure (2000), Catalina Garnique (ické Aly) (2008).
The question many ask themselves.
The result is a defeat of great favorites, which in all previous rounds showed that it has to become a new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen's police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, reached Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took away the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to appoint her only the first multimission, is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "What book was most appreciated by you and why?" said Martín Murillo Gómez from Leamos' literary editor.
She answered the question of the candidate:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was the Little Prince, a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirowski, Russian author, and it is a wonderful book called "El ador de la sangre".
However, this reply did not like the term "culturalize" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was in peace and had the joy of the outcome: "The world is wise, what is to be done, it will be.
And you people, read if you can. A little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other mortgages is that Valle has destroyed her position.
The Bogot journalist indicated that the candidate was the most popular, most famous, and the one who had received all the previous prizes (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen's mother), raised the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on the scene.
It was obvious at the first presentation of the swimming pool on Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was on both lights, she was aware that she was missing the power and the heat that demonstrated the representatives of Magdalen and Atlántico.
Ariel Osoria, the journalist of the program "As Home" at Canal RCN believes that Melinda received the title of the first multimission confirms the fact that the candidate who obtained the most titles during the competition ultimately does not go with the queen's crown".
Moreover, Valle has had a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and that has not been paid.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn't convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only at the edge, two days before the election of an international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty is not enough for itself, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social affection. It is important that candidates should be involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points because of the shortages of her background and fibroosis, which was marked on her back. But that is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her the mission of "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orosco, who is preparing, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, but problems with fibroza to her back, which, in my opinion, was not too noticeable, took points to her last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos' magazine believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when several surgical interventions had taken place.
"Chirurgical interventions are fine, but they did not succeed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here it chose its tax."
For the reasons of this award, which was first awarded to the National Assembly of Beauty, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled after the show, and it was claimed that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had provided for not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina started a year of her reign today, not as queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, they are written into history as one of the queens who, despite the moving success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali resident who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
Cali's fingerprints expert came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfox Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed Farc's top leader's identity: "Alphonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working on the CTI department this week, there was a line on Eliazar González, the men of Puert Tejada, who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked on a town hall in Chocó, where he had to walk through the forest often more than five days to get to a place where corpses were necessary to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle's capital and after he graduated from the relevant courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with skin friction studies, i.e. hand and foot hands.
The week that surgery was performed against that Alfonsi Can, Eliazar told him to bring his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He went to Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and suspect that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with fingerprints Guillerma León Sáenza (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at a place where the dead body was found, he didn't recognize him because of physical consciousness, and he looked completely different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, no glasses, much more slender.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with galton's lupu, ink and transplant, Eliazar's light began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the credit card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, a man originating in Puerto Tejada was charged with the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm whether this was really the highest commander of Farc.
Search for trace
For a dactyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the recognition shown by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operational services against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
The Dactyloscope is an excellent science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people are helping in investigating crimes such as stealing or murder and confirming the identity of the persons caught.
When they get caught, a lot of people present fake IDs or don't have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief resisted to pull out a vault full of jewels and money.
Walls are difficult because they are not intended for prints, but in this case we could get a print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicions in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with alcohol bottles around him.
On the basis of an investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed.
Although he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The fingerprint expert from CTI explained that the prints "street using chemical or physical reactive substances" are drawn from the objects.
When it appears, a transplant or tape shall be used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is a database of dealings, or to the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are nowhere to be reported" said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles isn't gold, not everything you touch remains traces.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
"Whether" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifesters were distressed at the Zucotti Square where they wanted to stop.
A large part of them was waiting for space to be cleared and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ossad Wall Street movement provoked on Tuesdays by a New York representative when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, from where they were taken in the morning, and then they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifesters were distressed at the Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows the "wildened" to return to the place. The other part of the movement responded to the debriefing by taking the park in the north of the city, where there was another arrest.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue in a legal battle with a view to returning to Zucotti, both through meetings and peaceable manifestations", said one of the spokesmen of the movement "Osat Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray made it clear that the answer to the "hot" camp, ordered by Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting violent eviction of the site and allowed the manifestots to continue to establish here.
In addition, the other park located on the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Six Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the Pharisees in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the manifesters. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that the cuffs had also been planted with some journalists.
The organisation assures that several hundred people were in place, and there was also a delegation of religious leaders to express their support and also trying to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. It is expected to be a court of law that should happen on Tuesday, and during which the lawfulness of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred manifestos even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even given it to members who were guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifests struck.
The Court order forbids the authorities to move members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "laws that have been published after the call has begun, or to prohibit access to the shops park or other places that used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg said for the press that, given this court order, the city suspended the opening of public space again and the manifesto pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor of the city personally defended the early eviction of the Zucotti Square, an operation held for 200 people and to which it was represented because of the manifestostite "the law was breached".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the squares because it became "a place where people did not go protest, but violate laws and in some cases harm others" because "some trades got threatening letters" and "the neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The rational decomposition was terrible and shows Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people," he added a spokesman movement to the mayor, "that he does not appreciate freedom of expression."
The representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said that they were planning to organize "big action" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to remind them of two months after which protests were held.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Maria on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Pamela Anderson canadian was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", an appetizer in "Playboy", a wife of a year's musician Tommy Lee, and now a actress and a model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian TV.
CTV's private television station today announced that Anderson and his singer Michael Bublé and other major Canadians will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will be embezzled by the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed images from the television program in which Anderson, also known as the Internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding in the caves of Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, the famous Canadian comedian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peterse will be in a special Christmas broadcast by CTV canadian singer Bublé, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato and who has close to the controversy.
Recently Bublé called an American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan returns to life after a destructive earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends in the fall period started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the destructive earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has had to face the world since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government numbered the material losses of $300,000 million, the wound, which, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to definitely turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for the Japanese tax year start in March 2012 - in addition, expect the biggest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the purchase of machinery which is necessary for the recovery of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending decreased by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true awakening of the Japanese economy comes solely from an impulse that forces the crisis to make use of the crisis to get stronger or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flow fell into the hands of the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors who run from the euro area against the debt crisis and the worrying forecasts of the US. It is a privilege, however, which is also a great burden on export firms.
Products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony counted their weak results in July until September of the yen course.
While the markets continue to cover the border countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And the perspectives are not really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States it showed clear signs of economic slowdown.
The index that predicts invulnerability in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers has slowed down.
He fell four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even got under average, which is located at 100 level. It got up to 99,13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says that savings will be approved, but conservatives will not make any written commitment.
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that it once again managed, Greece is increasingly inflated to the labyrinth, which leads to a large debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "consistency" of the new transitional Greek government is given rather the requirements of Brussels rather than the true belief of political forces is beginning to confirm.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he had received during his appointment will probably be short for their application, the president of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support and repeated his request to dispel new elections on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October", said Papadimoss yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will lead to the vote on the government's trust tomorrow.
The 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message makes no clear doubt about his attitude: "We committed to helping the transitional government, but we did not commit ourselves to anything else."
The president of the Conservatives went a little far into the EU and the IMF's address. These organizations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens needed urgently. At the same time, he said that he would not support and sign any commitment regarding the implementation of the austerity measures.
The European Commission, already affected by the impact that caused Papandre to play with the referendum yesterday, stressed that its demands are inexcusable: it does not block any aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not accept "the written commitment without duality and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Trojka inspectors will return to Athens very soon and will deal with the new government on "what needs to be paid for the sixth part" of 8 billion. The final date does not exist.
The Greek baby has a little bit more to be wrong about.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has reached an important position at global level in terms of microfinance".
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that during the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in "that this is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
The Queen launched the 5th global micro-credit summit in Valladolid yesterday with the belief that "not doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for us to reach the target of the Millenniums, which the UN established by 2015. "The plan is to meet the objectives to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, with the amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this responsibility", stressed the Queen of Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summite, which will last until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women", which are mainly intended.
"We've already reached many" and "my many challenges are still ahead."
The sum of micro-credits is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic goals".
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families had access to these financial services and that 100 million families would get over the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-credit was extended to Spain and to other countries of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus' idea made this path" said the Queen and added that it was "the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
She described this instrument as a "dividable idealist who went on the path to fighting poverty." She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet herself directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the 1999 Côte d'Ivoire, Canada, was followed in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could conclude a constant development, explained the Queen, who, due to her support of this project, earned the title of "the head of the family" which gave her "the movement of the poor" in Valladolid yesterday.
Queen Sofia concluded her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus allow them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" which must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that there would be an error to combine cooperation with developing countries only with the period of ballistics, because this cooperation is "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro-credits represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty" and now more than ever governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with solidarity criteria and not let solidarity become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, the micro-credit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State secrets for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez welcomed a success that celebrates a concept based on the fact that we will trust the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in a city that "opens its gates to solidarity which is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect the European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was only in autumn, in particular to satisfy the members of the parties who consider government policy today to be against the Greeks, and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians as lax.
The proposal for President of the European Commission was adopted by almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
Several-minute ovations were brought to the conclusion of Angela Merkel's performance and then several hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of chancellor and design can be summarised in the slogan: "not less Europe but more Europe" response to the crisis.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because " nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to Chancellor in Europe, "the time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing for enhanced control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electoral right "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of a proposal adopted by a congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the UK and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position against them.
But the direction is evicted.
Similarly, the delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the board of the European Central Bank, depending on its economy's weight, which clearly results in strengthening the weight of Germany.
She is worried about calming down the climate within her party, the Chancellor has made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohla. She has not tried to gain the congress talk about the 'small' European states or of the states that are in trouble, willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Although one paragraph of the importance of "French-German Friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Not directly.
When she reminded me that exactly two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Lipska's.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is fraud in in incompetence?
In support of this, the parties to the UPP and the government of offensive against occupational incompetence are launched.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be at Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak up on the topic that has been repeating since 2007 to combat social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an escort to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased strictness, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority of right-wing inability.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity before taking support in the disease.
In fact, without the consent of the company, a worker who is ill lost four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures risking a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
And also measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic reach: to give state employees one day of incompetence (unless than three days in private sector).
While these questions are the subject of a discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the subject of fraud, this time for misdemeanors connected to work incompetence.
"The stories will be much more extensive and besides: if you are caught, you will return," said Xavier Bertrand during the interview given by the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear a little disproportionate in the light of the truth on injustices in occupational incompetence.
In fact, these have been the subject of permanent monitoring since 2002 and of the political influx that brought their fruit.
French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop first at several official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM-state health insurance company) more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, the daily compensation was EUR 11,3 billion in 2008 with its health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity contributions and accidents and 54% had an inability to work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health costs.
According to the study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides certain deviations in it: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com's working opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees asked for an answer that no working day had been taken.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, explains that in 2010 37.8% of the incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 month to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbours, French workers are no more than in other places willing to work incompetence.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (from health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Encouragement in job incompetence represents only a very small part compared to work in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small scales.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at the incapacity of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that during 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of 285,000 were made because of the short-term inability of "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetence of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "inadaptable or unauthorized" were counted on 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million workers who had incompetence.
Number, which represents much less than the number of expressive work to the black.
According to MPP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent EUR 9 to 15 billion missing in the choice of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before the Parliament and added that 100 days of his government’s unity would not be enough to fulfil this task.
"To build our economy again, we need the support of our European partners and the new rescue budget plan," said the Prime Minister when he held his first public address on Wednesday in the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of decisions adopted by the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would be from now to the end of the year '9%' gross domestic product after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rule rejects new austerity measures
The leader of Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday by the already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but he pointed out that his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measure," said Samaras at the meeting with the Members for his side of New Democracy.
We have agreed to the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economics and Currency, warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without any written guarantee from all parties that would support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the expert commission
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to the Canadians.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
The Canadian society is living the idea of derelict death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility to speak to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, among which were ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government change criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this option appears necessary in a patient considered competent to take such decisions.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent survey of an independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada was placed at 10th place, the study notes that "dedicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization is yes or no, 77% of the Canadians have no access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is valid for all Canada, while in Québec this is the highest number with 86% of people who died in the hospital.
As regards the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the reports come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is nothing to change on the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subject to checks on all countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered to be criminal, there is no evidence that this retribution causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons not fit or disapproved.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed during a teleconference yesterday more than numerous cases of these surpluses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Ethanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"An existential suicide is done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are inclined by euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that according to the 2010 survey carried out by Angus Reid, 85% of the Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending messages about the life of the elderly or the handicapped persons is less valuable.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that a withdrawal from treatment for which a legally confirmed refusal exists is not punishable.
The expert committee also requires that professionals be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fearing criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Remuneration of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a medical specialist, qualified the position of expert-signators of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the exercise of euthanasia to the ill at the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of living and who would have more than 18 years might ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied rhetoric yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the report's authors have built the autonomy of people over all other values that create a social pre-life of society.
For "in society," he says, there are warning marks and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville's specialist in medical law also expressed "a strong objection to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Someerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society itself, doubts especially about the dates of the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the American State of Oregon.
The Jordan King calls on President Assad to resign
The lady's talking about "complot"
Syria is becoming more isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad were manifesting before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday diplomatic pressures on the Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, who resists and talks about the "complot" against his country in support of Russia.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Lize Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state who called on President Bashar al-Assad to forward power in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had the heart of his country's interests, he would have to give a demise, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for the new stage of Syrian political life", said King Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu has recommended that the efforts made by Turkish intermediation in the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"The ones who are not living in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," said Turkey, with a contrast to the neighboring Syria, which is increasingly applying more and more hard lines to.
The United States rejoiced from the "consensition of the consensus against Assad and the non-respective behaviour of the Syrian regime" after decisions by the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey, are increasingly applying the tone to repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As Syrian human rights observer announced, during this time, 16 civilians in Deraaa, southern Syria, and 19 members of the Pro-Term Forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed" at the shootouts and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at the press conference of the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Moualle, he estimated that the country went out of the crisis."
After all, he also responded alive to the decision of the Arab League of States to suspend Damascus' membership, which he believes is a dangerous step."
Syria's not bowing," he provided with assurance that "compatibles against Syria will not succeed".
After his decision to suspend the Syria membership, he is currently considering the League of Arab States"the mechanism of civil protection" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined by the idea of sending observers to the United Nations in order to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime which he believes is "paranoid".
The new League Special Meeting is called on the Rabat tomorrow to take an opinion on a plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, and in which it was expected in particular to withdraw the army from the cities which had been sued by disbursements and the release of prisoners of the manifests.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lavrov considered yesterday the decision of the Arab League as "disputable", while China encouraged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but it was completely avoided in support of any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices in Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to shape his team and start applying a program that will contain "objectives" to regain credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before he met representatives of experts and employers today.
It should set up a relatively slender cabinet composed of technocratics not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies of Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti will, by Friday, ask the Parliament to put his trust in order to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with the presentation of a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness of financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In "democatia, precise deadlines" apply in terms of government preparation and its programme, he stressed and added that he is "sure that markets will be patient and understanding".
Its appointment by the President was a favorable market, but the concern appeared again after the unexpected fall in the industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team comprising, above all, the technocratics, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politicians".
He expressed his belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking up his duties, promised to act with extraordinary urgency and in order to make Italy a strong article" in Europe.
The spokesperson of European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "and with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its objective of balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Business Union of Confindustria Emma Marcelaggli, who met with Montem on Tuesday, focused on the need to reinvigorate the economy" or a country that does not show growth cannot follow the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence,"professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the introductions, the call for seriousness" and "other Italy" represents "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years"berlusconism".
The big unknown is his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place state bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for the atomic weapon, announced on Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specialized in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) shall rely on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents that have been avoided from this UN agency.
Last week, MAAE communicated her"s serious concern" with regard to the possible military dimension of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, a broad drawing of the MAAE documents should work for three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet military research centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where it should deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the Centre to set up a manufacturing company in Kiev"ano-diamanta".
The economic difficulties of his company were to bring him to contact in 1995 of the Irish Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was to cooperate in the Iran programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the MAAE points out that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who did not only know this method, but which - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his career on this technology in the framework of the country's military nuclear programme where he came from".
Anti-Muslim crime and delicates increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delicacies directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010 while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in catholic violence, a decline of 4% in Jews and a total increase of 14% in anti-bosses criminal acts and deliths.
The total number of "independent criminal acts" very slightly increased to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences by the FBI and 20% by religious differences.
"After the collapse of 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and délicts again rise", stressed Human Rights First,"the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important", added organisations in their communications.
"Human Rights First has stressed for a long time that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the leaders of the organization Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and has to do more to deal with these evils", adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "involuntary criminal acts".
An independent crime in American federal law is the legacy of the time of fighting for civil rights.
This rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish the violence associated with race, color, religion, origin, and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and is similar to more Facebook
On Monday, Twitter’s micro-bloging website introduced changes in design to enable its users to observe the activity of the successors, which somewhat resembles Facebook’s services.
New offers"action" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are watching you or people whose answers are "tweets" you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to follow contributions whether they are applying to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, said AFP spokesperson Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its limited instinctive functioning, with deadlines somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repetitive dissemination of contributions by someone else,folowfriday pour recommender de suivre un alire utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus Large avec un maniement plus comparable a celi des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it's too similar to Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"Function of Activities will help me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the entry into the Constitution of the Golden Rules on the Balanced Budget
The Government of the Grand Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, in Austria, decided on Tuesday to record " Gold Rule" budgetary policy into the Constitution with a view to reducing public deficits and avoiding any possible reduction in the assessment by Austria's credit rating agencies (AA).
He was the socio-democratic Chancellor of Werner Faymann himself, who reported this decision to conclude meetings of ministers in a situation where Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much less than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros each year", the multi-channel and foreign minister, the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger argued.
Austria therefore draws on the request of the summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly asked for a reduction in public deficit by the end of 2012 and a balance of public accounts to be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "ruly".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (HDP) every year and, starting with 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal State will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Federal countries and the municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to get the public debt under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty in the period 2020/21.
Strong just
Noda threatens new interventions on foreign exchange markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign markets if they had to continue strengthening.
"We will strike, as we have done last, if we discover too little inconsistencies" in the exchange rate, explained the Senate of Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only went back to historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
That day Tokyo sold US dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently exceeded the dollar record from 1945.
But since then, only regularly supported purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and a European debt crisis.
The dollar got back on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the level that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
The Japanese currency’s flooding is harmful to the island’s export because it heals Made in Japan’s product prices and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currencies.
"Japan recovers" from the destruction caused by the coastal earthquake and by the wave of tsunami, which destroyed the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is afraid to not kill this betrayal yet in the eggs of fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to a survey of export growth and consumption of households affected by disasters.
However, the Prime Minister considered that the high value was not merely reflected by the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese finance minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BoJ) to launch a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to weakening alone.
However, the multi-governer of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had previously adopted "quietly measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakening can be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities issues increased by 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euro) its purchases of government bills and increased to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amount devoted to the purchase of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms are constantly concerned about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday, 15 November, fall into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 hours, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
Index Dax in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around euro area loans, which are in trouble, markets with shares worldwide continue to produce only a part of recent profits".
"Nerve investors only realize the risk of disease", explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
The storm in Tokyo closed down by 0.7%, which suffered due to the concerns of market participants on Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"The Japanese as well as the rest of the world has the eyes set on Europe and the shift will only continue in the narrow corridor variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyos Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainty about the future of the euro area damages the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at the lowest level since the month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is $1.3570 when a 0.4% retreat.
According to the realtors of the currency, after Angela Merkel's CDU party accepted a proposal on Monday, suggesting that the euro area can be removed from the countries that will be in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This morning, on Tuesday, the return of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the return of Spanish decimals is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting South European countries' interest rates, but also in France, continue to strengthen market concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly required time in markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be "main task" of his government.
Spain is again located in a deliberate line of markets when there is a election to the House on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expected numbers reporting growth of the euro area
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of primarily due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE revised the downwards of the second quarter to decline by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it's the fourth quarter that concerns economists most.
For its part, during the same period, Germany registered growth by 0.5%.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must win over the dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The diversification and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must establish their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will start from now to 2050 by double the demand for electricity, if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and it cannot be forgotten the necessary need to reduce the emissions resulting from greenhouse effect in order to combat climate change, which is the subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima has no influence on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case for Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a different source able to replace itself or Switzerland, which it considers right to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand their park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the crash of the Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
The choice of Berlin will be shown by a scratch on the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported, particularly from Russia, by a sharp increase in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of power plants on natural gas and coal.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
Denmark's case deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is collected, is also one of the largest coal and gas consumers because of the irregularness of the wind, for which CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% or 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbor's invoice will pay for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing industry maintenance on national territory, French companies enjoy the advantages of the most attractive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity which would make the illusions a beautiful statement of reindustrialisation of our country and defence of purchasing power.
The price that the large majority of the French refuse to pay, just as they are essentially not opposed to this energy, as the public opinion surveys show.
Let us remind you that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125.000 direct jobs and with 400,000 direct jobs.
The highly exportive sector is leading to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises producing jobs that cannot be transferred to abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost €6 billion a year for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the failure of his manufacturer would be planned?
When dealing with an energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy generation, because there is no devilish.
The development of low CO2 equipment, nuclear installations and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French industry group AREVA, testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a non-compromise and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is respected have the idea of blood safety.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal conditions of operation and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl drama caused the concept of a reactor and unexplainable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the death of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident just like it did in the last two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to stop its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA and EDF’s competitors and release the way to strengthen their leadership in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best solutions for energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogma and machination control the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or chances for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the intimidation of police, courts and administrations subject to the policy of numbering, the compatibility of this policy with the status of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative burden, the object of which was foreign students, who became present, when the Interior Minister (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France does not need foreign talents, dentists and waitresses).
But so far, it's rarely been dealt with under the economy.
It is necessary to say that in this area there is enough consensus between the left and right.
On the right hand in 1976 Jacques Chirac announced that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million migrant workers are located" and Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France" could not accept all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of invasion of the mountains of Polish plumbers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps immigrants are seen as a burden to the economy and to the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we want to offer to immigrants.
In his program François Hollande is limited to banality when it states that joint developments will allow our "migrational problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may be paid in elections, but economicly it is very expensive.
As pointed out by the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 str.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the host countries.
Restrictions on immigration will protect growth and harm employment.
The concerns of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Less qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer seats.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this supplement between the French and migrants makes the arrivals of immigrants positive for the wages and employment of French workers.
So Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
At the same time, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of migrants brought in contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalised immigrants among the American bearers of the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrants will arrive at the age of 30 for the whole of their lives in public budgets a net contribution (income minus expenditure) EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate that he would like to come for a missing percentage of growth" with a valued teeth".
The teeth that were changed used to disprove immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember that, although he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, glags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar, Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that, in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it will be enough to make the choice and conduct it in the directest possible way.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General electoral law, although the condition of democracy is not sufficient and can become a "pressive device" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, separation and control of powers, education, education, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just like that and from the start of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the error of the Greek referendum will not have the value of dual revelation in this regard: the discovery of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the revelation of the disturbing feeling of his impropriety, his inaccuracy.
This ambience must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic will have now moved and that many of the Republican warriors no longer shoot in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs into an empty nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know exactly where to stop the account - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is facing market discipline and credit rating agencies who suffer from their inaccuracy and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.
We are anxious to transfer our sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its nations.
It is urgent to return to the management of the European democratic sovereignty project.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to rid the governments of the markets and by investing in preparing the future.
The exit from the crisis will assume decisions at a European level which will not be able to be adopted without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to a disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European Economic Government.
So be it.
But to think it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such as citizens would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European building.
In order to establish the Republic of France, it was necessary to "be" the Republicans.
The revolution of interest could not have sufficed.
This lesson continues.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building Europe with more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us be Europeans to build Europe.
"Untouched" chip cards spread
The optimism atmosphere will open on Tuesdays in Villepinte near Paris a world fair of chip cards.
According to the Eurosmart cabin, 2011 should end up by increasing the global sale of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM-card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most transportable segment is the contactless technology that allows for payment in public transport or to handle purchases only by connecting the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chip cards against 320 million previously sold year earlier!
In 2012, they should continue to increase (estimated 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the APEC countries, Europe has been receiving ground-free payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 40.000 contact cards of Visa have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million unconnected Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To include a higher gear, it is necessary for banks to entertain their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients a non-profitless bank card", announces Gérard Nubouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But that's only the first stage in the future payment measure: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed for the execution of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"It's late."
"But their real conversation should happen next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world to 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are getting ready to move forward.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a supporter for contact payments.
The BPCE bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay their mobile phone uninhabited.
The Terrorism Front dates from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are unions of terrorist group Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and niger section Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister of the Foreign Affairs of Abdelkader Mesahiel even admitted that Algiers had been confident about it from now on."
"The way both organisations operate, and the intelligence reports show that there is a great co-operation between them," explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connection bridges.
After taking members of AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocur and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by special French units.
French and nigerian investigators were to find several phone calls with chips belonging to terrorists in the basement after intervention.
Terroristic axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, who has long been living in Maiduguuri, a town in northern Nigeria, which is a collage of Boko Haram, and another one to a person who is told to be close to AQMI and sect.
"It's progress, but it's no doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that sects enjoy external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active", a slight statement by Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwa.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same manner of execution, such as AQMI devices used.
Since then, the international community has developed pressure on Nigeria to consider the problems that Boko Haram created.
In fact, the authorities of Nigeria have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Fast Success
Sekta Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around Mohammed Yusuf's Mohammeda. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirata in Muslim North Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The section is recommended and requires strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are launching the fight against the Central Government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the supporters of Boko Haram become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is, as usual, still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf cult is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized itself and abandoned its territory in the north.
By Christmas 2010, Jos will carry out an arrest in which 80 people will die, and another one in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local United Nations office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania to Somalia, has been concerned with all security specialists from now on.
Now that Al-Qaida islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and Somalia from the Al-Sabab movement in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France was in state of emergency and is ready to give all information."
The world by candidates for president
On questions concerning China, Iran or Israel’s assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are exaggerating in simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis manage the world through simple or even simplifying ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
It has been several days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have repeated the shameful statements and instructions on foreign policy, which is a traditionally strong point of the Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or the help of Israel are growing together.
Mitt Romney, the best-inclusive candidate in the competition for the nomination of the Republican Grand Old Party, threatened by the occupation of Chinese in front of the World Trade Organisation and their accusations "for handling their currency", which is a carrier theme in America that has developed the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador in China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost fainted at a position that "suddens" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is at last in election estimates, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if they did not succeed in the suspension of his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm going to jail," he said fanfaron.
"If Obama is elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase the military help of Israel, accusing Obama that he had failed in his obligations to this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best candidate, shows an awkward ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp attitude against the Chinese military threat because Beijing"s trying to develop nuclear capacity" - obviously unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michel Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from being the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy in 2008.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They point out the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the failed departure of 'boys' from Iraq, his excuses relating to Libya, and thus enclosing him with a weak sticker
But the attack is not easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, he has no confidence in military action leading to the collapse.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leading position, Klep Obama to the right place.
Nord Stream, new Russian gas input port to Europe
The Nord Stream Remote Gas pipeline connecting the Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the Baltic Sea began to work.
They must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas company, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will connect directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
The symbolic German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte, turned together the control around the valve of Russian gas input into the West European Network.
This new gas will start to flow to Western Europe every year 27.5 billion additional Cuban gas meters with the first pipeline of 1 224 km connecting the region of St Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomors.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow to supply a total of 55 billion kubic gas meters, which is equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility of building the third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom has an early completion of this huge building the character of victory.
Against the project strongly protested Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will actually allow for the supply of gas directly to Germany without being led by a third State (Polsk or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: it becomes more difficult for them to push Russia against threats that they will stop him from accessing the Western European markets.
Varšava expressed it most clearly when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with an appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater certainty in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created cracks between the Eastern and West Europeans.
Russia barely five years ago managed to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western States with high gas consumption, whose bearings are approaching its end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that is organically connecting us," confirmed François Fillon at the opening of this pipeline and demonstrated at which point the large gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
This explains the wide smile of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lublin, the opening place of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a major technical act.
The marine pipe is made of steel with concrete coats to be protected from anchors of seagoing vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
It was necessary to avoid mines coming from World War II.
"For security, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffels, which, throughout its length, is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedishs were just too eager to see the Russian state society, as it was permanent to settle at their coast.
"In case of failure, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas will escape into the air.
But this case, the builder is considered to be unlikely, for welds were designed to cause leakage once every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas supply from the outside is carried out by a submarine robot loaded by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulations inside.
This 1-meter cigar-shaped device is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressed by gas.
For the purposes of three whole days, the speed of 3 m/s will provide accurate information on possible metal deforming.
The Remote Gas pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without having to be able to repair it any less.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in the target.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The head office remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
The German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gaunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its capacity for gas transport to the company for five years with an agreement that may be renewed.
"Gazprom will have profit from the overall capacity, whether there is any actual gas carried," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided with 30% of the shareholder and 70% of the bank loans.
The overall cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipes.
So for the GDF Suez group, investment costs stood at 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will come back because they only take Gazprom.
The pipeline is made out of the Baltic Sea in Lublin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Ventily high 4,5 metres is an output gas gate.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German gases.
From last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million kubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand note
The Italian company Moleskine, founded 50 years ago, wants to re-enter the joy of writing.
Brings a smell of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of candles.
Moleskine is easily discernible with its black rectangular plates and its leaves covered with white paints as if in time old.
After all, the writer Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decides to place a new design but distinguated notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is included in the placing of a new product.
The label is inspired by an old production technique "moleskin" (a skin imitation), which is used for the treatment of the surface of the bench.
This type of notebook was very valuable to writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the obliage of an old and forgotten object, which was the icon of Avantgarde artists until the 20th century", tells Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle for 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will take business as well as students or professionals.
The image of the Dictionary of Moleskine is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost 100 of them today and has two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookshop and through the chain of FNAC shops into small boutiques in the middle of the city where he knew how to enforce his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompany the development of the Journal of Moleskine: recently the brand has opened the exhibition " Zacházka", where architects or artists display their journal.
In August, at the occasion of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced new recordings of the notebook reminding leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and Diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, case on laptops ... The brand expands to a whole range of carriers.
Successed by envy: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today SyIntegrity Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed hendixed workers?
Around 19% of the handicapped are looking for a job.
Today, the 15th week is open for employment.
Despite the electoral public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed hendixed persons is even higher than the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it delicacy?
"No, he doubles the Éric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt Association, who organizes a week for employing the disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"There wasn't a percentage of unemployed twice at that time, but three times higher."
There's nothing left to do.
It should be said that many obstacles remain for unemployed disabled persons before taking them to work.
These are older people: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% does not have a graduation and from 2.3 million students in college are only 10,000 hendixed.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in hendicated patients compared to 38% on average.
In short, such criteria are which particularly complicate the return to work and which represent the 'the core of the problem', according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses receive the hendicated workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It's unresolved, ways of thinking that are definitely developing, but it's too slow.
Studies conducted in April of the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the questionable managers have" a weak level of knowledge of the hendicipated persons" s" overrepresented by the idea of persons on mobile chairs and mental or mental deficiencies".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from achieving the target of employing 6% of the posted workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers of 2008 show a status of 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of the Agefiph organization responsible for collecting fees from undertakings that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which have fallen between 2007 and 2011, of 59.000 provinces to 46.000 (and EUR 606 to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement will also demonstrate true awareness, especially in large companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the companies with 20 to 49 employees employ the disabled workers compared to 82% of the companies are 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How lucky"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens would not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly game.
We're not going so far as to write that there was a concentration between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach was given to his player only words of praise.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward", assures French Lille's player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and games of the national team," that's one thing and the same, he's just justifying himself."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally shine.
It is not possible to forget the concept of"radishness".
Play Bleus, which has been encouraging for 7 years and their winning campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This does necessarily contribute even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
That's more because across the border is Mathieu (Debuchs), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)" reminds.
"We were cruising right away."
"I can play against them, that's just pleasure!"
Dobrostrene Leekens reminded me of i"hrdost".
"Worship" to fight "pasts - holidays."
"Horsto" is also to be noted in the quality of "cossed" that France became a team of very high levels after trauma in the South Africa city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc has done a huge piece of work," he has breathed.
Although Belgium is missing at the next European championship, technical footballer would like to see a plane with the French direction in 2014... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he said.
"We're building something right now, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"Be aware of it for the next match," including France.
Portugal very self-confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches a large optimism of the barge against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
There was no realism in the way of both teams.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, above all, happy countries."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football representation with which it has been qualified for Euro 2012 since 2010.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
One game left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
In recognition of the fifth result (0) in hell of the Bosen Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of overweight, but it was not able to give such a rare goal to ease it.
"It's a good result, however, that contains a risk because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, Portuguese are convinced that they will go before the audience, which should create a screaming boiler, even though the match definitely appears very balanced", says an optimist, but a wise thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the top," said the 20-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We have a 50% chance to be on Euro 2012" yet relativised the successor Carlos Queiroz.
Undecidable Friday match in Bosnia force Portugal to score and win.
An undecidable match can be enough for the Bosňans who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, however, that contains a risk because we didn't score outside," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality", he added.
Like in Zenica, Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Boston team right from the start so that they won't give them time to think."
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
