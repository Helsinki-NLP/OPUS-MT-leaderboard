The Prague storm fell to the end of the trading
After the early fall, the Prague storm corrected the losses.
CEZ transactions have reached nearly half of the current daily trade.
The Prague storm has been building up since the beginning of Tuesday's trade to its Monday fall when it fell by almost six percent.
It's worth a drop of shares on Wall Street this time.
Even with us, there is a market response to the outcome of the American House's vote, which refused to support the stability plan for the financial sector there.
Stock inputs in Asia
A dramatic fall on Tuesday was the stock on the storms in Asia, although the indexes eventually deleted part of the loss during the day.
Index Hang Seng storms in Hong Kong have been decomposed by nearly four percent during trading, but later some of the losses have been deleted and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which follows the movement of Chinese stock in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end, losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan, according to that index, dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, Head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, is determined by monetary policy separately, i.e. regardless of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, American legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and the proposal to approve the financial system.
Otherwise, they say that other countries will feel the impact.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support plan to be spent up to 700 billion (almost 12 trillion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced blood spa on Monday and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest downfall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones's index dropped by almost seven percent and the fall in a similar range last seen in 1987.
Index fell before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal had not passed in the House, the index has fallen into a free fall.
Congress resigned: The US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the bank
Head of the U.S. Congress and Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of an agreement on financial assistance for the US financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The Financial System Support Plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters told the President of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services to the House of Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to sources, it may be possible to vote on the plan first Wednesday.
According to economists, the notification of approval of the rescue plan should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
However, then there will be a "cut-off" due to the complexity of the mechanisms to help the markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We made a lot of progress.
We solved our different views on how the market stabilization package should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, there might be a final vote on Sunday.
The legislators met with Henry Paulson's US finance minister on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy off financial companies that do not sell mortgage assets that are pulling financial companies into heavy losses and threatening the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the edge of the definitive agreement of the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are falling rapidly.
According to Needa democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors from trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in time zone, where decisions of Congress could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can put an end to any problem at the last moment.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still have a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be available as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
Congress, however, can block the release of the remaining amounts if it will feel that the program does not perform its function, and that in the sequence of another $100 billion and later the late 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
While the President may take this decision, Congress may vote in favour of it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to receive funding for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, is preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Jud Gregg.
American President Bush is satisfied with progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Frato declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "consistent effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies".
Limitation of gold parachutes
President of the Board of Banking of Senate Christopher Dodd, Head of the Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on their responsibilities for the money program, the protection of taxpayers' losses, the closure of relief, the timing of financing the plan.
The new law also has to limit the so-called gold parachutes for the Directors participating in the programme and set up a committee to be over the Supervisory Fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market as well as for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of owners of houses who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for mortgages that it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayment for debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea according to Patri Finance's main economics, David Mark, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"And that's because they don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and government are going to split up," Marek said this week for iHNed.cz.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it's not so important according to Mark.
"It is more important for the Congressmen to agree this week that this plan is supported and that it will be dedicated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is at this point the most important," said Marek.
Fight to blade: MP3 mobile players.
We'll advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can telephone.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Yet, there is enough reason for a single player to be appointed.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and the demands.
I'm guessing you're going to have a high-end turntable to listen to his latest album, Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on LP boards do not come out and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if your racks were to blame for the art of rock, jazz or blues, you probably at least dream of a turntable.
It's the same with music on the road, i.e. a composition music, simplifiedly - music in MP3.
Even here there are price categories and qualitative categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns per player, just like Pink Floyd's fan, it's probably hard to bite the headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes with enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery maintenance
Some top music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most cell phones do not happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and texting, he can play music and video, both recordings, has better, the worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And when we take smartphones and communicators into question, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, there's no fridge that can grill and no TV prints.
Mobile universality also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest cores of energy.
Small cell phone can play music for more than 10 12 hours, mostly less.
In this respect, musical players (especially the easiest ones) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap phones, therefore, expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still have one more charger in and out there, you can get another charger to work for sure - even for more expensive machines.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse they will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and in addition, not each of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a small reader of cards will deal with the miniature memory cards they use in phones without reduction.
You don't need any special software at players' except for any exceptions (iPoDs).
All you have to do is fill the device with USB music from your computer.
Most cell phones and players are already creating a music library based on the name of the interpreter, name album, genre or need user evaluation.
Some instruments display only tree directory structure similar to Windows explorer and some both can be displayed (iviver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easy to operate, mobiles can do better
When selecting a particular device, consider especially the battery capacity, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, the comfort of control.
If you have music, first of all, a bullet and if you listen to it every day just a little bit, like, in a tram, you just need any cell phone that's gonna play MP3.
Which, indeed, can be done by almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to see what kind of music cell phone or player can do.
MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of music that will get to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the largest and besides it the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in the WMA format.
AAC is less likely to occur (the form used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow for example the purchase of online music.
Just across the mobile internet visit the respective operator pages (or other providers) and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a valid argument for the acquisition of a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is usually limited to fast-kneaded hit radio.
The prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (though already via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will be managed by the music industry in the future.
Most people still wear Mobile.
Any time you want to hear something, you get your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it is still important whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell but only a minimum MP3 players.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of music phones will be the price of many.
The cheapest is normally below three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns you will already receive a very decent walker.
Most of the time, however, you will be reduced by the absence of output to common headphones.
The best and on the technical side of the most enjoyable telephones with a 3.5 mm hole for common headphones is up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum function, similarity of control with an earlier standard taper or, perhaps, a turntable is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an error in the mobile Internet and then a giant account for data transmission.
After which instruments to touch
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the cards you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive one will deal with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have your phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB) you may not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, you'd prefer to try on specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These instruments have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operating is so close to a separate MP3 player.
It is no longer in Sony Ericsson, whose phones from a series of Walkman have the same user interface as those sold alone by MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery capacity (at least 15 hours, up to 35 hours) they will give you MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator to arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here -- a virtual operator who can make these classics go down.
Maybe she won't be long.
About the Czech operators being among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobile.cz many times.
In addition, this was confirmed by the Czech Republic, which pointed out that the SMS price was higher than in the rest of the Union.
The European Commission's recent steps in regulating roaming charges are likely to have a paradoxial situation - SMS from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to hope that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has expressed himself several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much chances anymore (otherwise, it would probably be hard to search for frequencies).
But there is another possibility - virtual operator.
Just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant reduction in prices that the classic operators had to react to.
At the same time, before the entry into the market as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile sounded similar in the UK as in us.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobile in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, there is a financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they just need a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of mobile networks.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often exported by a closer offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move as well as a bet on an unturbed target group.
This operator specifically focuses on men.
"Administrative men elect Mobilking - an operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a similar concept like this could be caught in Poland with us.
He doubts the press spokesman Vodafon Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, they say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator is in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobile.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not seem very promising in the Czech Republic.
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson of Penta's financial group.
It is not directly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined.
Rather, it is trying to do everything so that no potential competitor can escape.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been a member of the GTS Novera Group for a long time, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telephonics in the company's customer field.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with all Czech mobile operators about this option.
We have already managed to move forward with some of them in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe it's for a better time.
From unofficial information, it appears that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to the end of the year.
For now, however, his creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a full virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň said in his statement for Mobil.cz from the press department Telefónika O2.
More operators are also calling on the specificity of the Czech market.
A T-Mobile spokesman Martin Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project that could be built on."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, some virtual operator appears hard by the end of the year.
At this point we would have to have a specific agreement on the table in order to be able to reflect on this short horizon."
Vodafone tends to pay attention to the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable in customer terms.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is to find a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Offices responsible - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the input of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a price drop and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to something, the operators pull one rope, they also testify to U:phone.
The highest pressure towards the ČTÚ went at the time of U:phone from T-Mobile.
They witness public information from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, U:phone fits as an argument why not let the virtual operator admit.
Martina Kemr said: "The competitiveness of the mobile market has recently been forced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high requirements on him and, above all, on his service."
However, in view of this approach, mobile operators are directly concerned by the very lack of Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only the position of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no power to interfere with competition.
These belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Office (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole issue.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after the agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the lease of the necessary infrastructure was concluded.
No such contract has been concluded until now, since the offer of potential candidates was likely not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," said Kristian Phalupa from the Department of External Relations.
I don't think it's surprising from the operators' representatives.
From the office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market, it is more than in the considered situation.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Also abroad, where virtual operators normally act, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
However, clearly the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decline does not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
In fact, it is quite shocking to judge the three mobile operators that result from their response.
The question is, if this is just a coincidence, it is offered entirely by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol in pumping stations, I'm sure it's just a piece of coincidence and a hard competition fight.
"The Authority did not find signs of counter-competitive conduct in this matter, and therefore there is no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore does not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their market negotiations.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecoms regulator," he said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the Czech Republic, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of competition is the only market.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on this market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the establishment of a virtual operator must always be approved by the network operator.
And a mobile operator - has a relatively logical sense - on his network of monopolys.
So it must be dominant in a certain segment.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators act in a conspicuous manner.
However, complaints by a number of interested parties (including those mentioned above by GTS Novera) show that they are facing very similar obstacles during the negotiations with all operators.
Privilege responsibility on the ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in telecommunications, which ÚOHS gives his hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, with the extension of the powers of the Czech Republic to competition in telecommunications, has not been able to put forward, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
That must be what the ÚOHS representatives know more than well, but they're probably their interests elsewhere.
It's true if no one's watching.
However, without notice, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators that there are now several in the Czech mobile networks.
They're companies that own the price list of mobile phone services, which are only partly public.
It's usually a multi-level marketing company.
It owns mobile phone service so it offers, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The pricelists of these companies usually only get to the chosen one.
The spell is that the company has performed against the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a prominent customer then gets special prices (and more) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators similar to those prohibited.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," she answered our question to this problem by Martin Kemr.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity would not have been made available to responsible mobile operators.
Especially in the case of three of these companies, they can be thousands of customers.
Neither of the operators prevents such a procedure.
In contrast to actual virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The act of a similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies benefit only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept on their name, so they cannot have it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
That's exactly what the CTU should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for the ÚOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators arrive over an eye like this, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to reveal similar activities, and if he does not want, he may not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea about such activities and their business conditions prohibit it.
♪ When we're not the dearest ♪
As the text has seen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought noticeable price reductions for services.
In fact, in almost all countries where virtual operators were formed, classic operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were virtually identical - too small, or too sophisticated market, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In developed countries, however, the regulatory authorities in these moments have affected not only the interests of mobile operators but of their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressures they then achieved that the first virtual operator was created and that others were packed up.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities overwhelm the case as hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the fact that they are more than suitable for uncertainty in their competences.
But let's not put the flop in the vein.
If background information is correct and virtual operator will really soon appear in our country, the Czech mobile market will perhaps again evaporate.
If one of the operators has admitted a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult to remain indiscriminate to reject (discriminate) other candidates.
And maybe we can stop calling the irritatings than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to four versions of the new Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the state anthem where my home.
Hymnu has recently recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělářka.
There are four versions - male or female solo singing, in choral application and instrumental text.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took the song.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
The Belarusians consider the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had previously said to the Czech Radio that he purposely chose to sing solo variants of singers with young representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried to make sure both of them and the congregation are clear, so that the text should be understood well," he said.
The Czech State Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the board of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlováček Josef Kajetán Tula, supplemented by music by František Škroupa.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her to their own.
The first song of the song then after Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918 became a natural part of the state anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
What's "new" anthem
Prague MHD for the first time in Wednesday will be delivered to the chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as a date when the first passengers on the subway, trams, and buses will get their first tickets instead of paper tickets will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this point, he can take approximately a hundred thousand people who own Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30-day and 90-day coupons and annual coupons (this one will pay from 1 January 2009) and at the same time let them record their chip card in infocentres and workplaces of the Transport Company at the stations of the Museum, Bridge, Nádrašovice, Angel, Roztily, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday also via the internet at www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who use the internet store can definitely forget the exit window at the metro stations, where they still had to stay in the long fronts for paper tickets.
The coupon buys over the Internet and the Opencard card uploads it to them in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers are available a bulkhead with a trained operator, which will help those interested in the online purchase and also record their card purchased by a coupon," said Martin Opatrný spokesman.
In addition to the library, you will be able to upload electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several metro vests.
What kind of slots do they look like?
They are red, they recall the ticket markers and the passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly metro stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltava.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80," the careful added.
The coupon will check the driver's seat with the automatic
The service of machines that start tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are not only valid in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the suburban trains and bus lines with number 300 to 499 driving to the capital, mainly residents of Central Bohemia.
"In trains classified in Prague's integrated transport, guides are equipped with card readers, using which they detect the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables for Prague mass transport.
Local buses have card readers built in a checkroom with the driver.
Thus, not only does the chip card need to be shown to the driver, but it is also necessary to add Opencard to the designated place on the side of the box.
The driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not drive suburban buses and will not remember when they end with coupons can go back to the self-service machines where coupons are recorded on the card.
Here they will see information about the validity of their documents on the display.
Sudety wanted a U.S. referendum
The Sudanese Germans in 1945 asked for the inclusion of Šumava in the United States.
It's coming from a letter that's stored in collections of South Bohemia's scientific library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronization of the United States of America.
With such desire, some groups of Sudetsk Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is, among other things, a letter that has been preserved in a private archive, and today it is stored in collections of South Bohemia's scientific library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in the letter of the American President not to let the return of "Sumperia guppy" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the right situation and want to be truly sure of the words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, "The people whose fate lies at heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia has been reportedly given to the Sudetian Germans - in the knowledge of Czech national character - hope only for brutality, inconsistencies, inconsistencies, pressure and slavery, he asks the authors of the letter of the President of America to take over Šumavou a protectorate for the present and everlasting times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter million inhabitants, you will admit this country to a foreign state that is repressing and reversing minorities and nothing, I have done nothing to win the Allieds," it says in the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thought of the Summa Germans, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the United States' patronization.
Although the text of the letter can sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of postwar history, some memorials say it is appropriate to draw the expectations of the Sudetian Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least know that they were going to be moving from the Republic, few of them were allowed to do so at all.
Some have expected that the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate certain types of autonomy to the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budejovice.
He was set up for the Navy in Baltu during the war as a Buddhist German.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in the prison camp in Holštánsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would be useful to them," he said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia were expected to be removed from the Republic by Benes ’ decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Turns out the engine campaign will attack the driver.
The most expensive actions focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rebíčka promises her to dissuade the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
The driver should advise the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them that before they leave, they shall bow down.
He wants to touch young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the joint?
Especially the human stories that attack emotions.
And the whole campaign's word is "bloody":
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on the espionage.
And in a pool of blood, then the word "you pay."
It's supposed to symbolize that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of indifference.
The viewers will "drow" until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglosian countries, where pictures with drastic images of the victims of accidents can normally be seen.
He promises that an accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads will be reduced.
The stakes were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Driver's sugar and whip
"The system of sugar and whips applies to the driver.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they go on red, it saves time.
Run is a threat to fines or accidents.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital at the Homolce Martin Korřán.
And that's why we need information campaign in the press and mainly negative advertising, it's a psychologist.
According to him, tables are already less effective, which alert drivers to danger.
"If a static table is installed warning of danger, probably soon it will be connected with the surrounding area and the drivers will not be able to provide it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jedi Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the territory (occupied) if not all," Olmert said the diary.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to pass on a similar percentage (the Israeli merger) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that even Eastern Jerusalem would be returned.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want the tractors or bulldozers to cross over his legs, such as one of my best friends, will have to surrender to part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in a collision on two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places" which lies inside the Old Town.
"He who wishes to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he emphasised further.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an unthinkable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of departure from Golan," he pointed out.
"The soldiers know what they're going to have to give up to get Golany.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by Hamas (the Shia movement) terrorism, the (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaida as well as the jihad (sunwar) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the stevardi on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, walk on a remote bus can't be
In connection with the tragic bus accident, Student Agency near Italy Padova raised the question of whether they could be travelling on a bus or on a bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the work of the stevard is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelk.
An accident in which a 20 - year - old flight killed last week seems to have caused a truck driver to cross the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl sat next to the driver at least safe place in the car, although two more seats are reserved.
However, the bus can crash or sound sharp, even at the time when the stevard runs coffee or newspaper.
The role is whether the bus according to the technical card is equipped with seats to stand.
If the bus is not approved, passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency places for standing; which is now confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I have dealt with and first let passengers move.
Then we called it off, and we came to the conclusion that passengers could go to the toilet if they had their seat," he said.
The law of stevard does not know
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of stevard - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation nor prohibits carriers to provide services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the time-limit of the guide vehicle; its rights and obligations do not define," adds less clearly speaking spokesperson Hanzelk.
On the contrary, the Head of the Department of Road Vehicles of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law deals sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to sit in the approval.
That's what it ends," she says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where maximum speeds are placed and, inter-city with more allowed speed and distances without maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts, are limited.
Like on a plane, the expert says.
Expert BESIP on the transport safety of Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"There are many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to the service on aircraft.
It's not even sure when a turbine is coming and a plane can hit the head."
"But if the bus were to sound sharp, of course, physical laws apply.
Like in city buses or trams.
The safety of the stevards must be addressed by the carrier in internal regulations," he says and also points out, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The student of the Agency offers the services of the stevard as the only bus carrier.
He's employing two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be at risk.
"But as soon as I realize that it's a risk-free profession, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on board.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, he justified the absence of stevards in his cars, the director of Asian Alexy Litvin, which operates a fraction of the line compared to SA.
"We don't have steaks, we've been up against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with some fatal accident," said he less than a year ago for Week.cz.
It's become a huge tragedy.
In a link connection accident in Naples, a young stevard from Pilsen died, who worked for a company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably dropped off without using the direction direction direction from a stopline and blocked the bus path.
However, his driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he made the right frontal part of it.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stevard, Jančura refuses.
"These places are not possible for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With family compensation, a girl will not wait for the Ortel of the Court, but she expects financial compensation from the guilty.
To correct the law?
I don't see
The precise movement of stevards on board a bus could bring an amendment to the law, which over a year the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works.
"No concrete conclusion, of course, has come.
Buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, maximum speed on the highway and mobile use during driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the operation of the Steves to be something that would significantly jeopardise the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelk, with the fact that the monitoring of bus safety is under the authority of police and authorities of work.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
Big words in a letter from the Board of Directors of WestLB to employees of this bank do not miss.
By linking the units of this düsseldorf monetary institution to the French Deca-Bank, the 'central financial group' will be created for business in the capital markets' we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to a letter to this transaction, WestLB will bring "compensation principle" providing long-term yields.
It is said that such a link may be a decisive impasse for further association in the land bank sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act during the problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia is still fresh to find a solution for the future.
The link between Deca-Bank, which the customers of savings know for its investment funds, and WestLB, however, has been spoken for a long time - even on the French side.
At the end of August, Head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas heard that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the Land Banks such as Helaba or WestLB, they did not see any sense.
The board of directors of the Deka-Bank, for which it stands from one half of the Land Bank and from the other parties, has entrusted the board with the management of interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
There could be business in the capital market or part of it.
But the talks have just begun, they will be touching the financiers.
Deca-Bank, who is with its 3000 employees, is not mentioned for the first time to employers on the financial market in Frankfurt with regard to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003 it seemed that Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba might be involved.
There was nothing out of this threefold.
Shortly after the merger plans came to the public, the Hessen Government in favour of Helaba Bank’s participation has spoken out.
Neither did the rest of the bank houses.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Sutton.
Yet, repeatedly, there were speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank to the Earth’s banks.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba Bank’s Board of Directors, expressed a negative view on the link between its financial home and others.
However, it appears that independently, the belief that the approximation of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, the first to start drawing up the BayernLB connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not very good news for Helaba.
If pressure is to increase to further mergers, it gradually loses potential partners for such connections.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that the financial crisis has been facing significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Sutton.
Reconnecting with WestLB at the beginning of the year, the Land of Constituent and the Žire Bank of Hessen-Thüringen, which has a five-a-seven percent share in Helaba.
It would appear to be the most Nord LB.
The geostrategic considerations of this kind are but only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should be taken to ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Bank, the German Union has not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the layout of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why in the letter of the Board of Directors he is also talking about he's trying for a "complex solution" for the whole banking house.
Whether or not it will be possible to connect the individual files to Deca-Bank will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "víkend with Italy"
It's for Elena's first time, for Luca's third or fourth time.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, she says.
Behind them, with a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand, there is a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest prove how deep the notes can release his throat.
Elena Lucu's gonna cry first, and then she'll kiss him.
Verona came from Bologna.
From there, from the bus park next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
The three buses mainly share Italians, one bus ride exclusively Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South American people have already sunk their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And out loud, Marco Guard says, it's not for Italy.
Marcovi, who wears a long coat with a cover of leather patterns and glasses with wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
They have been in Oktoberfest for five years, only three expeditions are held this year.
In the night, between the day of the beer stand, at 22:30 a.m.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The journey costs EUR 75, including the welcome drink of Kaiser beer, cooked precisely under the Bavarian Law on Pure Beer, Health Insurance and German Speak Guide - Marco went on a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses are going to the night, on the carway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus is fast silent, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they're gonna need their powers.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 halves before Munich makes one more stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marcova group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresa, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, put on a yellow cap.
On the left it is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "consocersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors to the beer tent open, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
Go and plant seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, not all yellow hats on the same bench, you'll be placed in space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Let's show the comrades we're being nice.
Once you've left your seats, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Be right here at 11 o'clock!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, space with beer tents.
On the way one member of the group hangs yellow hats as a brand on trees, signs and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As the "manend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact data on the numbers of visitors are not available; it is spoken of by fifty thousand of those who travel across the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend arrived from Italy.
Many monk police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrols, Italian volunteers will support Bavarian Red Cross, leading the national statistics in which Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Rakušany (approx. 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments present their first place.
The state of Hofbräu is especially popular in Italy.
Sleepless Nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word 'rative' and has also included the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared by crisis development.
For the one about the past weekend.
Index Dax followed by a financial house specialising in financing the properties of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of a few billion to protect against turbines on markets from the consortia of the German bank.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told Agent Reuters that this loan aid would go to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will only have to be paid by the amount actually exhausted.
I hear the money comes from private and public banks.
In the background, the losses of Depfa’s subsidiary are.
According to the newspaper reports on long-term projects that he loaned money, this state finance has been extremely short-term, which is no longer possible because of market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve fell by 95 % to EUR 2,37 million and the equity share decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions decreased to zero last year, income from increased value of claims and from certain securities and also from the abolition of reserves for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher compensation revenues for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest according to the tax order, and the 16 % decrease on the income side was still moderated for the promotion of trade for the corporate companies.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burnt down on mortgages for trade unioners, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and led by Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state funding was made too little, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diverging.
From the value of his subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something down, and these write-offs will have a "primary material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the whole group as some have left themselves unnoticed.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major fundor for state and infrastructure projects since Depfa took over.
Stronger than other institutions, it depends on refinance on the interbank market because it does not have any customers' deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, he practically dried up the springs of interbank loans two weeks ago, because the banks guard the liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs money annually for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - approx. 50 billion Euro - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the report by Hypo Real Estate, the financial need for this loan is covered for a reasonable period and the company is protected 'before the influence of international cash markets to a large extent of inability to function'.
Other sources have been heard that this money has been refinanced by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use cash markets in a timely manner.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute on Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank are hoping for this.
But, given the dynamics and inaccuracy of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, neither the opposite can be ruled out.
After the bank's late Sunday afternoon seems to have stood before the insolvence, it cannot, though preliminary, save passion.
The stock rate fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond courses were well held.
While priority debts have not practically moved, they lose secondary bonds significantly more.
This is mainly a bond of former subsidiaries of Württemberg Hypo and logical bonds with maturity beyond 2009.
Obligation of Hypo-Real-Estat originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought it into the company by taking it into the company by Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and less affected business banks are willing to support the system, they can be counted against the deposit of securities within their maturity.
However, there may also be what almost no one dares to hope at present - in the next 15 months the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time with this partial standing, the likelihood of a bordering with certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors will probably prepare a number of late nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the limit line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the exchange rate returns of subsequent years for the future payment of capital revenue tax.
Sylvana and secret box bento
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropová first day in high school in Tachibana, girls will start to sneeze: the German is completely "cawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from the mang, and he's talking about Japan on his new exchange blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was about to get out of my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train in the high school in Tačibana.
I had to find my way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tačibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine a short sitting with a teacher, called 'home room'.
But before schooling started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes talking to people at all, let alone 40 students in front of class.
Because I didn't have a school uniform, I took on an old dress of my host's mom's shirt, the shirt, the blue undercoats, and the black leather shoes.
So I built myself in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajónra Woš Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and I'm a birthday next week.
At that point, I was so happy to learn a language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the classroom were fucking, chichitata and movalo, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my husbandg.
It's part of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, necessary for survival, and it means 'nice, sweet'.
Then I quickly ran into my place.
A girl smiled quite widely next to me, she thought she was honored to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong called, they literally caught me.
They spoke one across the other and chichotaly and asked me about possible even impossible - while it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then they all unpacked their bets at the break.
My host mom also made me a lunchbox, and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and some fish in the tofu of petals.
I don't usually know exactly what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
Sure is, everything's really good.
Well, except for salted plums, bru!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl will give a boy a patriotically prepared bento, which in this case is especially artificially modified, and hopes that a boy will get to know about the break during a snack.
That's what I read about in my comic books.
I'm wondering if I'm gonna see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo school for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it's just fascinating.
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese a little once.
So I was perfectly clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the latest technology and trends, on the other is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
♪ And rats have feelings ♪
When rats or cockroaches run from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals feel.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same way when they act like us?
In the web magazine "Edge" many years, contributions from well-known scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else so far could prove it if we can't even prove that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to another species and open up perceptions or general consciousness, we enter an unfamiliar terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat gets in danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, run or attack.
People are acting the same way that some scientists are referring to comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal consumption.
However, it is because the circuits connected with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is developed in humans much more than in other primates, and it seems that there is a missing area in other creatures.
At least with the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that one distinguishes even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the human’s tongue: since there is so much of his perception connected with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the knowledge of the language did not matter, surely the language would affect him, so that the animal consciousness, whatever it is designed, would probably be different from most of the states of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to find out what consciousness in other animals looks like.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot measure even, because of a special hardware, an analysis based on our own experience, we are faced with his examination of his major problems.
Most of my extracts refer to the content of a conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientificly accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially for example visualisation.
But this approach, dedicated to Christ Koch and Francis Crick, is focused more on the neural correlate of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What results from this?
It's because an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain by its own activity.
So what we call "strees" is a mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with language nature there is a slight separation of perceptions, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to add them together to others.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the fields of cortex and brain strains dedicated to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed in the course of human evolution, it may be able to share in the feelings of many animal families.
I can't possibly resist it, but I think it's invincible.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and people is like fear is likely to feel both organisms the same: How is it possible to verify, says Pankseep whether rats and humans feel the same way when they act like that?
The cockroache flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, a mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that a neutral comparison pushes us further: rats and people have similar brain strains, and on the other hand they're snooping or brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for feeling responsible?
And even if it were possible to prove it with man: how would we want to prove it with a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to differ substantially from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case we can look forward to progress at a neutral level if we measure the same with rats and humans.
As with rats I don't examine tongue and consciousness, I don't examine or feel, I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than to retaliate against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: The God of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be driven directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early execution of the time plan of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both the hosts arenulling.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union of Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the Head of the Polish Union of PZPN was revoked and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
It says that there is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Polish press agency Drzewiecki.
"UEFA Michel Platini's residence has been assured by letter that this step will not suffer preparations for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced retreat only in the last season due to manipulation, and in the end they had to move the start of the league quickly.
Dennis Quaid is back on strike.
She wanted to commercial a new film, talk about private stuff, and now she's having trouble with her ex-girlfriend Meg Ryan's Hollywood star talking about her ex-girlfriend Dennis Quaid as the reversor of marriage.
He's mad and he's returning the punch.
The late war of roses in the former married couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors lead a minor dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan expressed herself in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time in her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she knew about the extent of fraud after the divorce.
Ryan's PR work for her new movie "The Women" is telling the story of a broken marriage.
The reaction of Dennis Quaida to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: "It's crazy," said the four-year-old actor of the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly outweighs the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
In addition, it is 'police' that the 16-year-old son, Jack, once again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes for each child of divorce."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the twin father.
It ends with its considerations of evading: "In any case, my life goes on.
I think I'm happy to have an amazing family that's doing great."
Flight prices and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to one current study were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and accommodations in hotels have once again reduced - this is the result of a study of the provider of travel and financial services of American Express.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made from the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices in the hotel market have grown, accommodation in many places has already reduced.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of 48 European cities, on average, by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year from April to June.
The most important trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a cause of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar rate that caused the "lowing taste of American tourists to travel".
The lower prices of hotels have also been affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and recorded a European record.
Flight prices also showed an increasing trend in the first quarter:
Because of the healing of kerosene, passengers in the economic class had to pay by an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the fuel of demanding long-term flights was even healed by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, flight prices in the Economic class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, however, in classes Business and First-Class were less significant changes in knowledge.
In Germany prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9% grew, and 23.6% fell in the second quarter.
In the German national years, according to quoted studies prices decreased by even half.
One reason for this price drop is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement that liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The significant pressure situation is the disruption of low-cost airline carriers as well as the high number of airlines that declared the competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladadch 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV becomes the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to build a working 11th.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein, increasing the Unforgivated Landing for the Marko Marina representative.
This player from Gladbach entered the game until late and failed to pull out the balloon on the stick.
His report was very well-formed, and it seemed very convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the hamburg arena cabins.
Not much was done in catacombs, the break between half-life ended, and most people sat in their seats.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for almost three decades, and he enjoys greater respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol attracted and raised a finger on the sign of conformity.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's head coach's brother.
His order was probably similar to that: I am with the other goal!
There was no progress.
"He didn't look at everything here today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "precisely more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgns thank the head of Mladen Petrij (11.) and the circumstances that very weak Gladasians could not harm weak Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence this Monday.
The audiences celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the arena and a live updated videotape in which their team was presented as a bonus.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
It considers that the continuous tabular result symbolizes rather the incalculability of the league rather than the dominantity of its HSV.
Team with late arrivals of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silvy, goalkeeper Petrić also from FC Bayern obtained by Jansen - although slowly located but is not yet able to close.
"We need more affection and more dribling," said Jol.
After defeating the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first reports of sinking the rescue package caused a drop in the Dow Jones index by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained some weight.
Around 20.30 this world’s most important stock exchange barometer showed a five percent decline to 10 579 units.
The technology storm Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in a minus of 1548 points.
At this point, most of all, in Dow was American Express, who lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs bank shares lost nearly ten percent.
A few days ago, he had a share of the Greater Warren Buffett in this company.
The rescue plan shall provide means for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the total amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to get a stock option list of financial companies that could be paid in favor of the exchange rate, thus reducing the burden on the government budget.
Stocking courses in Europe fall steep
Miliard's help to banks in Europe and the US makes no doubt about investors.
The share course of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly available and is downloading the Dax index with it.

There were stock markets all over the world.
In New York City, the business day on Wall Street started with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that the US government's rescue package worth $700 billion would not be enough to reinstate financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, and so is at 10 809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives is to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on 1 October.

Dark matter affects years of space probes
For years, scientists have not known advice with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation washing machine).
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
She's been flying the Ulysses space probe for almost 18 years.
The blame for the fuel lines that will soon be frozen now threatens to die in winter.
Among the scientists for years one mysterious phenomenon has been a mess - anomalies of gravity washing machine.
Gravitational washing machine is an air maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space material, such as Earth.
That's why probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case: flying bodies do not seem to be 100% what a person would expect under the good old gravitational law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularness at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly speeding up or slowing down.
So far, the physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by anomalies of a gravitational washing machine.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of the matter by curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken and was trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational washing machine by means of so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be found very close to the earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space explorers for about ten years.
It clearly comes from a gravitational force, whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, she's completely invisible, which means she doesn't send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of space.
In Egypt kidnapping tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister's message, tourists are once again abducted to freedom.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a purchase of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were killed during the shooting before release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I heard the ransom is on the run.
The Germans are repeatedly facing the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists are apparently free of charge.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija and the Italian media reported this.
The Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini, according to the reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were freed.
We're looking at their medical status right now," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, there are five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian guides are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are apparently on their way to Cairo.
The lack of clarity remains the background of the shooting before the release of hostages: according to the statement of the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudan army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
They say "it was only a hostage to take over," when suddenly "this surprise."
Sudan’s soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" with an appeal to one of the German intermediaries said that the release of hostages is stretching because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female gender hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be kept until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
My father's abuse "has led to suicide"
Multiple years of fatherly abuse led a woman to kill herself, sounds court-martial.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, he was a seven-year-old Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle's stepdaughter was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," wrote Trerise in confession.
In court, it was also said that Ms. Randle killed herself in her home at the Multley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, it was said that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, had pursued the phenomenon of abuse that has been committed twice a week.
Ramsey Quaife's complaint stated that in 2006 Miss Randle's friends, who also very much devoted to surfing and cyclists that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "sold up life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to have suffocated herself with an plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with saying, "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrible when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done that, she probably wouldn't have gotten to court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents claimed your crime on their daughter for those years," he added.
"It would be otherwise likely to be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who lost his data will be charged with
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
Documents got into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the least serious act against that law, and there's nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
The BBC author Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
A worker who may not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause which deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to sue on the basis of the very sensitive nature of its work in the Joint Rapporteur Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents that he forgot included a secret analysis of the Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
The secondary bases face the debt of B&B
The British cooperatives may have to deal with more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided EUR 2.6 million to protect deposits in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that receive customer deposits, including 59 cooperatives.
Director-General of the Association of Cooperatives (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "breathing" that the deposits and their members must pay.
In the end, a quarter-billion debt will be paid to save Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that comes to hand will pay off every year all 700 financial companies that receive customer deposits.
The Fund of the Compact Cash Services Plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this figure.
It is coercive that these institutions that have behaved prudently... now must pay back some accounts of those institutions that have not been so considering.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company was supposed to pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the orders were supposed to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase to GBP 450 million in 2009.
That means the charges will have to find 81 million pounds to pay off the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the cooperatives' trade union, said the BBC was convinced that this was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the development of the housing market must now pay back some accounts of those institutions that have not been so considering."
According to BSA, no lineage since 1945, when it appeared, has not fallen.
"We will have to examine in the next few weeks all aspects of this matter so that we can see what are the possibilities for protecting cooperatives and their members from an account that could be substantial," added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March.
In 2010 it will be to pay interest for the whole year and this could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperatives are a shareholder-free organisation, that account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk heals by fivepence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey's milkworks have announced that it will increase the wholesale price of their milk by five pens per litre from Monday.
It's the second price increase this year, after a two-pensty betrayal in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers are to decide themselves whether they want to reflect on the customer prices.
The wholesale milk price from Jersey was last changed in 2002 before February.
Coffee for Bangladesh Expremier rejected
Bangladesh's court dismissed the application of former Prime Minister Shajch Hasína Vadijid to release bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her bail in connection with the charge that extortion received more than 50 million such from a certain businessman (729 700 dollars) when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several charges against corruption.
Chálida Zijaová, the long-time political rival Shaich Hasína, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasína is to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked that the local army held by the government first give her full freedom.
The subscribers say that while she was released on an honorary word to be able to take up a medical procedure abroad, it is not according to the terms of her release clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say he'll now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court.
"The Chief Court rejected Shajch Hasin's request for bail, with the fact that he doesn't need bail when he is already undergoing an investigation released on an honorary statement abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"We'll appeal to the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return from abroad to the country for preparation for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sajch Hasín is to return home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army held by the interim government took over power, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for a medical procedure.
Shaikh Hasin and Chálida Zijá both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of arms vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children did not participate in recent obese vaccination due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
The UN did vaccination in six provinces last week.
But she says she couldn't get to the children in the south in the parts of Helmanda and Kandahar for security reasons.
The UN spokesperson stated that this would happen despite the Taliban’s promises that thousands of vaccination workers would not be attacked or prevented from working.
BSkyB lost a court dispute on ITV.
BSkyB had lost a court dispute to review the Commission's decision on competition which allowed the company to reduce its share in the competitive transmission of ITV.
In order to reduce its share in ITV of 17,9 % below 7.5 %, BSkyB’s call for competition.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB had a competitive struggle and had a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a market share in 2006, which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virginia Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Office announced that BSkyB’s acquisition of BSkyB’s share raised doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to initiate the investigation.
Chief of Consortia Virginia Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and controller Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unclear and as a solution to disproportion - especially because BSkyB previously said she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigations into American lawyers' affairs
The U.S. Attorney appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the Agency drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislator and the former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during investigation have lied to investigators in order to have justice.
Chief Inspector Glenn Fine said in the report: "A serious statement, including a potential criminal offence, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force a witness to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Justice Department abandoned nine American lawyers in December 2006.
That's when the Ministry said the lawyers were released due to weak performances.
However, later it turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of highly built Republican Members and Senators, others refused to investigate the accusations against the voters against the Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and conducting prosecutions in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report by the Chief Inspector for the role of Gonzales in the Agency expressed very critically, saying that he carried "main responsibility" for discharge that he "abdicated" from his leading position and did not "resistibly engage".
Other officials, including former high Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's class will be appreciated
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer who comes to London next weekend for his special gold prize said he was "respected" by credit.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Laf's Hit album from 1977.
This year's Nomination leads to the Coldplay group, which has become more important in four categories.
Paul Rees, the main editor of Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs standing above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed a large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began an instrumentical part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a single, and it was at maximum 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held around nine years in the ladder and sold it around the world to more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - a real name named Marvin Lee Day - has suffered in recent years of health problems, in 2003 he was also operated due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007 he was forced to cancel his concerts.
Later, it turns out he had a cyst on his cell phone.
Stacey streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground communications, some famous, other only useful.
But even many cabas-veterans and long-term locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, usually because they never heard of him.
This tiny alley is in East Village and leads north of First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about 10 and a length of 40 meters, it is more like a dusted passage than a traffic move.
There are no sign of street names.
She's practically invisible in her regular atlas.
Yet, an admirer’s alley has an alley.
For example, Avalon Bay, developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to new extra Place and create a cleaner passage to stores and boutiques to open up in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-term neighbors who say they were a short-ranged alley of charm simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was depleted.
However, the City Office for Protection and Construction, which has a street in its power, is not least interested in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Committee of the Municipal Communities, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay have drawn up a plan that the developer of the street should buy.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district managers of General Community 3, the Committee favours such a variant when the streets remain in the city's hands and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city has only very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"We could make proposals for correction and administration, which may make Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to re-schedule a small street and plant a seat to sit, several of which would use a coffee shop whose interest is to rent the developer's space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published on a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesman Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to correct this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that sales designed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Bureau for the conservation of buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and he pointed out that the task of his office was to develop property rather than to manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a lead in history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802, when the big farm of Philip Minthorn was divided among several his children and no one made a claim on the narrow lane of the country.
The Extra Place led the back door of the CBGB, the punk monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps most famous as the background photo on the Ramones group album "Roket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about the depreciation of East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that there should be a piece of public property, even penitential, should be public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unaltered part of the city to be left behind as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's disappearing New York City (with the subtitle of the "The Book of Screams: A bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of dying"), hung up a part of the story about Extra Place from the box Let's talk about the city that appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark as well as day and bordered by rusty iron gates of warehouses and inflated windows, where the old newspapers go through the week."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of one last night looked exactly the same.
Krysa passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a store with expensive clothes.
On the wall there was graffiti and next to the fresh doses of dumped newspapers there was an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of passers said that Extra Place rarely thinks, but it suggested that he might need some kind of mutiny.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thinks that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The greatest years of my life," he said, "they were in places of dark, wet and disgusting."
The debate on biling quality: immersing in English
In this edition, the framework for education will be focused on Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the positions of candidates for biling education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and the Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Horser than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
To address the Hispanic voters effectively is a small matter.
Barack Obama's education agenda proves it.
Obama's campaign states that "Afro-American and Hispanic students have a significantly lower probability that they are getting than white pupils," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda specifically promotes, among other things, 'transit bilingual education' for those learning English.
The question of Barack Obama remains, of course, if his commitment to biling education, which places emphasis on using languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases of Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only arrived recently, are English only learning.
Even though in state tests from mathematics in 2008, one hundred percent of fourth-class pupils reached the highest level.
Almost as amazing 90 percent of fourth-class pupils got to the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and training, continuous assessment of capabilities and access without excuses.
In addition, and that Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikels, Director Sixth Street, the pedagogy approach of the school for those who only learn English is "full immersion".
Inflammation in English highlights the almost privilege of using English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who's against biennial education, said to me, "We had a great success with one of the very new pupils in Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and you didn't know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, what other schools should look like with a large proportion of Hispanic and English students?
The results of the school are to be taken out of response to this question by self-evident, but the education agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a long-term advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education makes it impossible to predict Obama’s response.
While Obama agrees that the immigrants should learn English, the recent thing was trivialized when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to delete the performance differences, he should rather think about the educational models that work, carefully to think about rather than make fun of them and make them laugh.
Oil falls rapidly due to restored economic concerns
Oil prices dropped rapidly on Monday due to concerns that neither the US plan to save financial markets would need to reanimate the economy.
Prices of scheduled oil stores dropped in the morning trade at the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets were shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching the maxima $145.29 for the barrel in July earlier this month, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel, and then they jumped back into the wave of enormous uncertainty of the financial markets.
The injury re-appointed investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history reached this weekend.
This report has been clouded by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy Wachova Corporation's banking unit.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partially settled the European financial conglomerate fortis.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that a shattered weekend event that led to a plan to save the economy, "they show them that they are unable to recover the mood on the market."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for markets with global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have made a strong difference," wrote the Deutsche Bank analysts in the report to investors.

The wild ride in the second quarter overcame the team record
After he spent more than anyone in Jets' last eight season, he thought he'd seen everything.
Then Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the scoreless game into a Spanish ride.
"I never saw anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and Cardinals, with their lost play, compared to the dark clouds over themselves.
Then Quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuse Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly foretold the afternoon in which they gradually developed cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter to another two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell back, and the next 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre told him of all his contributions to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We've been communicating perfectly, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked a quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith got another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced was perhaps the best.
Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely 20-yard goal out of the field, resulting in a lead of 34-0.
That's what Jets got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe this madness, he said, "The other quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both Jets allowed 21 points unanswered in the third quarter, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
There are many points in the short time section."
Rested Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Hail Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best remote runner ever when he crossed his own world record on Sundays in Berlin and became the first man to run a 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasant flat track in time 2:03:59, he drove his previous time in Berlin at 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, created a 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - has overrun the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the maraton.
Last month, Gebreselassia left the Olympic Maraton in Beijing because he was afraid - from the point of view maybe too gruelled - that polluted atmosphere would upset his asthma issues.
Instead, he promised to run off in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the target - won on Sunday, Gebreselassie with a lightning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998, as trackers such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have dropped the Mars record in the past decade.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassi told the journalists that he had convulsions two weeks ago and left a week of training.
The break obviously got him up rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," said Gebresesassie to reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started over a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African Rival of Ethiopia - because he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's Moroccan point, relying on conductors, as if it were a race on the track, and he built world record of the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassi's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyas, Gebreselassia reached half in the time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors went off, Gebreselassi was constantly chasing two elite Kenya runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little more than three miles ahead of Gebreselassie’s goal, he lasted and fled to Kwambai, who then ran in second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended the third time at 2:07:48.
In the female race, she finished her excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenková, a native of Kazakhstan, now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 is holding Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixteen - year - old Mikitenková won a surprising victory last spring at London marathon at 2:24:14.
Beijing Games left behind for something that was described as back injuries, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which was ever run, improved its personal maximum of almost five minutes.
She ran the race smart and thought-out: she had the readers of Ethiopians and Kenya's cross-country runners run into a big lead, and then after about 18 1⁄2 miles she dragged them.
Askale Tafa Maggarsa from Ethiopia took place at 2:21:31 and Helene Kipropová from Kenya ended third time 2:25:01.
Hearts and obstacles to life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the splendored amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from all the shiny, loud and obscene, lies a quiet city in which pride and the severity of African-American life is at present.
Eatonville, the first completely black town, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neal Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described him in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough coffee, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora's annual Eatonville Festival! to lay down the bow of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The town she described remains aside, although she made a stop for tourists by including him in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the period of economic crisis.
It is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930 ’ s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man that “he knows so little that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in a year when the Black Presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many of the inhabitants of the country are left with caution against the sight of strangers.
"We pay great attention to our story," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the black rising and a community of nearly 2400 people, where poverty rates are double than the national average.
It is also a center of literature, but also an example of the Southern countryside black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - created from American slavery.
It is not very surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And worried about Eatonville's idea really started up with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are saying.
She introduced her hometown through a hearty book full of shoutings like "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (Jehovah's eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five blocks of Florida tourist guide changed the town to road 17, which leads through a often mixed centre of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the stamp of the great drum in life and literature, Hurston’s readers introduced Joe Clark’s first eatonville mayor, and then turned to a separate place.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "the white brownly decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston's Eatonville was self-inflicted, but also with illiterateness, re-opening marriages and sex.
Apparently, this wasn't a typical Fedor's publisher.
Actually, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says the 90 - year - old Ella Dinkins, one of the Choirs of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang out of their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston still remembers as a clear shelter that often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
The seventy-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that, most of the time she came to town, she arrived in a huge Chevrolet, smoked and carried pants in a city that is also proud of a decent dress today.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were squealing.
"People always liked to see Zoru," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on the back terrace with a view of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, " she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her about the rest of the world together.
Although she was once a literary star, the present of Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the twenties of the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no larger memorial service or great public readings.
"I think they didn't understand its meaning for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biographer "Wrapped in Rainbones (packed in rainbows) published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city through a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
Orlando's dissolution has already pushed interstate highway number 4 through the western edge of town.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complicated historical period.
Integrated integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the battle for the mixing of the race of hatred was brought up to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They threw melon out of the car."
In the letter The Orlando Sentinel of 1955 questioned Hurston's requirement for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the education chamber, she said that it was "for my race insulting rather than celebrating."
People now claim that school desegregation, even though it was positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people here.
"Black kids were used to hugging - I remember - you embraced your teacher in the morning, you embraced your teacher evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dikins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights helped to create space for many other Zory Neal Hurstonová - black writers, actors and artists who, as it was, were uplifted over prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker was in possession of Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting for her reputation to be restored.
Five years later, he came to the police in the bookstores of the praised Hurston biographer from Robert E. Hemenway, who re-entered it in the American canon.
The highway project arrived at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the lights of the ramp.
The former Hurston neighbors have now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to its highway, the community began to plan Hurston in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and many of them return to the party every January.
After a few years of remote motion, the state has resigned.
"The five currents of the highway would rise, you'd say it was directly set off, real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Foreigners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new single-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 for the resembling and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a floridan anomalies: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen alley in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(The day is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for a story and meaning of Eatonville, they are often treated with caution.
Allowances for most interviews must be given in advance and certain things - as wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that painted whites and which depict blacks in fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to be red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival has increased, home pride has also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, not as proud and as creative, working, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicists.
From Franklin's son-in-law, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, there is an honest love for the village when she plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police that she says would use some help.
Even younger, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass through here, will think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sundays to the church.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York, we all talk gas finance.
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the news booths and various TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never decide that in the glassed bee hives of offices over their heads they have bankers and managers of investment funds who monopolise New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rumbled with metal carts in the sidewalks and carry the muffins to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, 50s of high-end shirts hanging from the vahadel on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street dining booths, and there is still no way to get a yellow taxi on the day of day between 4:00 and 7:00.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until I had, with all the talk about pessimism, he decided to start a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to cover up with the late afternoon seat on my local branch JP Morgan Chase, there were about twenty people waiting there in the front.
Not in front of cash windows to pick up or store cash, but before the bulkhead where the older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to shop with mixed goods Macy's and new customers start their accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
But they've already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They selected money from so-called three-thrifts (a bit similar to construction savings), cash associations and those types of savings they operate in only one state, claiming that their customers care about as a family.
In the past 15 such banks have disappeared.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, audition, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, she tried another bank, Wachova, with assets for $440 billion, to catch a life buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops who stood before me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and expressed herself to Lehman Borthers, the broken bank, and to her embodiment executive Dick Fuld with such familiarness as if she ran over a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed about fifty-year-old homehouse of my apartment, changed the theme of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food supply.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I have my savings in the funds of the money market right now.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-hand side of the Freedoms and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration, which presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the "Cities against Islamization".
There are signs similar to the traffic signs showing the Mosques crossed by the red line.
Police blame right-wing extremists for desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz, sometimes between Friday night and that morning, were badly destroyed and the police are convinced that this was an organized event.
The culprits spent Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's star, but the detectives believe that this could have been an attempt to suppress the motives of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident has been connected to any choice.
The spokesperson of this Islamic community said that they were "deep shocked" by reports of desecration that comes at the moment when the Muslim post moon of Ramadan is approaching the end of the Muslim post moon.
In the meantime, Austria enters its own soul search wheel after the traffic went down in the last parliamentary elections.
Both extreme right-wing parties, which brought together more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party, and the Union for the future of Austria, led the vehemently anti-immigrant campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, who received over 18 percent of the votes, protested against shawls and burrasses in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as a relationship to Islam.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna he talked about "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides try to ban the construction of mossies and minerals and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after elections, which have built an extreme right to the position of the strongest political block in the country, indicate that this change was caused mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't take a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamroc star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials ordered this six-month ban on Glitzer after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police agreed last Thursday after she handed over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, himself named Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Canadian police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to a foreign country, keeping records in his sex record.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also pass the scheduled date of departure to the police in advance of the week.
If the duty to inform the authorities is forgotten, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that it will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the district.
The spokesperson of the Kent police said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that control potential danger more effectively.
Protecting Kent's people is the highest priority for the Kent police, and we carefully work to watch the behavior of recorded sex offenders so as to reduce any danger to the public at a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he left for Bangkok, where he was due to enter London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the passport check and then finally left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him access and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbrid's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time, Scotland Yard had successfully requested an order to register him as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
The source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To catch a real character, I take a picture of a master out of the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, isolated from concentration on interpretation - so I can feel the relaxed expression of man or woman.
On one side of the artist.
For the second, man.
If we avoid privacy, in these eyes far away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, a depth of the years of the catchy view, or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer shoots at the "Flamenco-people" theatre performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles the unique flamenca iconography from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the program of the moon photo flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the growing international meaning of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-peple" can be any people but if you look at the photos, you will find that it is not typical of artists on stage.
These people who portrait "on the street" are able to transfer passion, sorrow, joy... and completely capture the viewers.
There is no need to take pictures on stage to capture the personality of these artists.
She wears her personality and character inside.
I was curious about creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenca.
Charmed by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started in 1997 a long way to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and the material resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it the present spirit, which is an idea that reflects Bauer himself and flamenco: "The music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What scares the viewers is not the effect of dancing, singing, or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
Search for the moment when we meet the most essential, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, this was and is the constant of the work presented in El Fotómata's gallery during these days.
These selections of nearly seventy photographers form famous flamenca characters, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenca and will soon reach a book release, which will contain portraits exposed.
The passion for portrait brought Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating "Portraits of Sports Veterinary Veteran" ("SportARTProject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to take pictures of people, to recognize them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think there's a portrait of the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he doesn't even know, or they only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, I always try to realize my ideas as a photographer."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedou de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "trepidity"
It takes place in an environment that is not yet known yet, and talks about the events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llossa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and traveled in Amazon as well.
The eternal favorite of Nobel's literature was admitted at the Hay Festival of Segovia last night that the project that's currently employing him is "trust" and that "all suggests that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't have done it, but I do it, and I believe that I will once finished it," he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "Město and dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens "Our Muslim Friend" -, filled the Juan Bravo Theatre in the last place.
With Félix Rome, who mentioned it, he had a dedicated audience, whose hour of time ran like water - Peruánec with amazing precision and a noteless amount of humor remembered how he wrote "disciplinary" from the "trust of a passionate reader" and from "power to live more than what I lived" gave birth to a literary mission; how the "respondence of inspiration" by writing "disciplinary", carefully regular text, corrects and translates; or how his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, and what "resist images" are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way to find out how and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a sudden experience" - stressed Vargas Llos with the fact that he thinks "to people is working" and "to make them try to get away from a series", and called on writers to "do not subject to frivolence" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climate science, the celebration in Popospolanc is lost - there are no copies
The performance with the copies closed at Pozoblanc yesterday morning was cancelled after the announcement of the effecting that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
Therefore, along with Fermin Bohórquez, Pable Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez decided to cancel the bullfight.
The adverse weather conditions are long-term celebrations, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, it made rain impossible for the other bullfights to run.
During them, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But this is how it was celebrated on Friday.
Daniel Luque, the winner, who cut off three ears and a reward for dynamic and aesthetically quality performance, was put on his shoulders.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two shots of his greetings and one ear that brought him uncovered seats in the arena rather than toreador art.
El juli, who went through the bull's arena of Los Llanos, unsalted unsalted.
In the second round, he worked hard for the majority of the community without a single breath.
They've run control in the van with two thousand pounds of hash.
Ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintz in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
They stop two people in the van, and they go for them.
The cost, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the report by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government, the members were persecuted and arrested by one of the people in the van, a man of 38 years of age who was identified as A. A. J.
Arrested was accused of smuggling drugs and forging state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road control at the N-1 in places where they passed the border of the Armiñón district.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, speeded up and ran.
The car men began to prosecute immediately when the vehicle stopped a few kilometres away, both passengers jumped out at that moment and went to the foresty plant.
Ertzaintzy’s servants finally caught one of them and seized 2 178 pounds of hashish, who was carried by suspects, as appeared in the search of Iveco Daily’s delivery.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with Hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments to detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "sealed" and did not agree with the particulars mentioned in the delivery documents, and was therefore also held accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to look for a second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to flee to finally determine the origins of the seized drugs.
Arrested A.A. J., 28 years old, he was transferred to the police department for appropriate formalities before further investigation.
Heather Locklear's actress was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Heather Locklear, favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (Kalifornie) for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the car park in Montecito, told People magazine call California Road Watch.
The witness made it clear that around 16.30am, "locklear was walking hard on the gas, connecting the noise-breathing to the front and back and trying to get out of the parking place," she had a couple of times had the sunglasses on her back.
A witness who didn't seem to know the actress first saw Locklear for a while after stopping at the nearby highway and coming out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because she was afraid of the life of Locklear.
When the police patrol arrived, he found an actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the truck.
"She was disorientated" and therefore the members took her to a specialised drug and alcoholic centre to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress cooperated with an excessive amount of alcohol, "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was seen by the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the proceeding under the influence of the effects of the non-specific substance and was taken into custody around 19.00 even though it had already been released for a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalus association of IU to exercise its powers in Silva's bail
The General Chief of IU and Member for the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today said that the final decision in the case of the former Council Department of Youth and Sports of the City Hall of Seville, Francis Manuel Silva, who resigned from the office last week after being accused of action for the benefit of his family, would depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too much a federalist for the Andalus organization to exercise its powers," said Llamazares of the meeting to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of IU insisted that, in the event of an investigation of an illegal conduct committed by Silva, it is absolutely necessary to "transparence": "IU has always fought for such matters to be more transparent."
In the same way, the party pointed out that it had a "serious ethical code for all public functions".
"Fun's Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic garci bet
José Luis Garcia in the film "The May Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), which inspired him from the national history of Benita Pérez Galdós, brings back the famous rise of Spaniards against the French – it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "represent the character and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria during the presentation of the film before a large team of artists.
May's blood with a mermire for over two and a half hours will be put into the cinema this Friday, and in the future, it's going to be more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of literary works by Galdós José Luis Garcia, she claims to have performed the "Children Dream" for which Esperanze Aguirre, who, three years ago, entrusted him with Madrid's Autonomous Province with filming for the two hundredth anniversary of Madrid on May 2nd, accepted the offer that he would be based on the Epizod national past.
The budget of 15 million, for which the Madrid Province has completely contributed, means to Garcia's "one chance" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "Third Spain, who was mistaken in the leadership behind which it was fought - a fight for independence led by the government of Ferdinand VII to the fall and insurgency of the country," he said.
But the director regrets that he can't count on the financial support that got to the movies of the Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's miracles - almost twice the May Blood - so he couldn't make some scenes from the script signed by Horaci Valcarcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as he is commonly used on the scene with actors who usually try before performing and who do not choose casting, because it seems to him "supposing" and he also believes that "the profession of director is part of the director's job to go to theatres and cinemas and so to learn what happens in the craft that deals".
Many actors who chose for May's blood appear before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guilén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four nominations at Oskar, one of whom he received, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May blood itself, the seven tables of the French trillion and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, does not represent the young generation of Spanish film scene, but claims that "it will only appear".
Garci's not expecting any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón is reviving the spiritual legacy of the Seville Dances of Valencia
Seville flamenca dancer gives tribute to another seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Catalonia (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three, she moved to London with her family.
She danced modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, was a pioneer of female emancipation as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of a corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman affected by the interwar Europe's dance and aesthetic revolution, Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she designed me this character -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about understanding the soul.
The names of her dance shows reminded me of the flamenca rhythms.
So, my butterfly dance was evocative of guajir or "tancing snake" some kind of thong.
Her dance was sensibly and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she claims.
The presentation is calculated by involving two special personalities: with Miguel They will lead who will sing to Isabel in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coral, who has made an exception and has joined the cooperation with her former student.
"Matilde represents an older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I'm happy she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
In the performance he also counts with music and guitars Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, singing with Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drums El Pájara, violou Rafa El Violay and co-working actors Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are Pridonami with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes account of the life of this woman, who has played for his time in so far as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she has usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but today nobody knows her and even less then appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Diary of the Fresh Wife" closes also the triennials
The introduction of the first edition of "The Fresh Wife Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez concluded a marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalus government at the celebration of "Trenal Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of Nobel Prize for literature and the anniversary of their death.
"Zenobia and Juan Ramón" are heading to the end with the new edition of this work, an international congress that will take place in New York, repairing Nobel's museum house and the "juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen rays of the sun" which was opened in May of this year, and after the various Andalus provinces will take place, it should be moved to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the Autonomous Andalus government also ordered eight hundred copies of "Dennik freshly married" modified by Pedrem Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and works of one of the world's most famous Andalus poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself that much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of Sally Field's actress, who worked with him on the "No evil intention" and under the weight of the awareness that John left, reveals his untapped vision of an abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he's retired since 2007.
And that they knew he was very sick.
Even though he was for all the guys.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot express in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is on the bottom when they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When the time is rough and the people without virtue and only a handful of people worth admiring you - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of us, it was an incarnate ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both the cases won, from the drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose, to the owner of the home food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has cost much effort to get away from suicide food culture.
The storm wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, said that a man had not died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, the owner of Oskar for the Sam Mendes regime, said that working with better men was the top of his career without exaggeration.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, would call himself the greatest source of inspiration.
"This foxy put on a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to live like Paul Newman today, based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the camera.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He got divorced once, and he's been married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who's been loyal, even though he's had more than enough opportunity than not to be.
"Why would I go out to a burger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven to have a judgment between his daughters and his admirers - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he made he was most proud of the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrifice philatropa".
Outstanding Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after 2012 it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow last night's race, I say, no!
He was mentioned as the perfect race, and according to my court, he was the worst one I've ever been to.
Such a mess of nonsense that, as soon as it came to an evaluation, and I was trying, it would be obvious that it was not enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
The nonsense begins with picking up a race number for which a person has to leave early.
That doesn't sound bad to me, but when you go there, give him everything (including the chip to prevent the overflow).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after landing the proper front) - what a surprise! - they had only a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
Is that because of the crisis, they only decided to buy a little T-shirts because it's less of a substance and it's cheaper?
Well, these are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Except that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front took him for over 15 minutes, he had to give up his backpack.
Over 35 minutes, the waiting time lasted, which is on the race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you can expect, the race started, and we haven't finished our backpacks yet, and once it's done, it was much worse to pick up.
The waiting also extended the rain for 40 minutes, resulting in a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have a trachea infection tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results of the chip that they gave me and which, as I suppose, did not notice the time of launch.
Of course, if anyone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of it.
And so I think we're going to have to keep our Olympics dream of well prepared.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction on the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent but able to perform basic tasks as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would be moving around the whole area of society) and to see what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their interviews.
It is also able to unravel present according to the conversion groups.
On a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that it does not belong to a group that talks to her and that it is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her she's going to take care of her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
It's amazing.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as the new version of Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the commercial unnecessarys, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as a thunder, considering that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
Change of direction would be a favorable act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning and the software is similar.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned on the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly indicated that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative to truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more Internet browsers.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its online service and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Desperate need it, and here I have a small example.
I did this photograph in one room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine that asks them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft’s employees were using Google for their search on the Internet.
By the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed last week.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to place Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the market together.
The phone becomes more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one match in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in "Kmother's" Francis Ford Coppoly, and he is part of a uniform gay community.
And if we want to get into his life's roles, we can dive into the picture of a typical muscle with a pointy mustache who picks up the action in a horse's circus.
It's basically nothing more than typical cotton men's lower neck, urgent and unscrupulous.
The English spokesmen call him 'Dak', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out of all the others.
First of all, for his cryful name - even though it is called 'Marcel' - which has a connection with sport because, as legend tells, was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over the other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which models of the most embitters as a detail at the neck.
And be careful because the Belgian company doesn't specialize in just a tank tops.
They also produce hoodies college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy T-shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just in the underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
She did not stop her own personality from developing her sister.
Morón Cruz, though small figures, is a woman full of life.
Your new activities in fashion are being taken very seriously by Sister Cruz's sisters.
For Moonic, it means a lot more than just that some nice, famous girls will lend their name.
The promotion event, which Mango organized in her new headquarters, was attended in Paris, and the publication of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and shy, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present a new collection, which we have proposed with Sister Penélope for Mango this season autumn-winter, while also attending the publication of the second year's "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in the Opera to honor Valentina.
It was therefore a demanding, yet exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have already worked the fourth season?
Me and my sister love movies from the '50s and '60s and we drew a lot of suggestions.
I also love to wander around town and watch women walk around dressed like they're combining and drilling their clothes very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
Maybe I liked my clothes from now on, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk to my aunt's closet and watch her clothes.
That was sensational, almost better than going to a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my clothes go.
You know, we dancers are thinking about how we're prepared to feel about our hours and our trials in the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you really get into a character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been 30 recently, you've had a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, 30s enjoy me.
I find that a woman is already done, she has experience, and she enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
Since I've been doing what I want, that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother, because my body wants it, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and bring him up with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, there are a few premieres you've filmed last year.
It's true, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I'm from the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, all I want right now, and that's not how I want it.
I look forward to the premiere of "La útima mountain" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
See how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the show hall side of Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend the fundraiser for her "wife for a better life", and the clothes we've done - I picked two models from our collection for Mango - to heal and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi's NGOs.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things talk about her, and I, because I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good thing he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but when she asked me to make a stand, I would do it, too.
For the benefit of women of the third world, I will do whatever needs to be done.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol management must install in his car a system that prevents him from starting a drunk car or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has entered the knowledge since June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Prosecutor, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the driver to the steering wheel, so drivers will also have to attend the course of the traffic overflow.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate General of Transport (DGT) and the Car Safety Institute Foundation (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the carers charged more than once for drinking driving again, he will settle for the steering wheel in this state.
Alcolock should avoid this as it is a system connected to a vehicle which measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price exceeds 1 000 euros, and he would have to pay for it himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that, during the first year of the introduction, the concessions decreased by 65 %.
In Spain, it is calculated that every year it could save the lives of 115 people.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: in order to deal with this behaviour before it comes to criminal proceedings.
In order to assist in its introduction, since legislation can be applied in a normal way, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires amendment of the law.
The equipment is not yet available in the Spanish market in any sales version, even though it has already been installed in certain industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spain Labour Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses as it is in France.
In Mexico without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as it was in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at the airport of Benita Juarez in México D. F. the plane of Spanish air forces, in which he travelled the prince and princess from Asturia.
The sun has just fallen, but its rays have so far forced their eyes to see the subsequent couple coming out of the plane.
There was a Spanish ambassador and other officers under the meeting.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver if he knew that a Spanish prince with a princess was coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, she won't be able to get to the airport and pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just at the red carpet and the military cordon, which makes up 27 marine soldiers ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The Prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue colors and a princess, very soberly dressed and with big hair, does not have their usual "peptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. threatens the storm.
Before they go to the O.R., where there are official delegates waiting, they smile at photographers, and they forget them.
At the hotel door, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there is a talkative Mexican TV reporter waiting for them.
Best gifted fashion price
Perhaps there is no better place in the world to publish fashion prices than Paris, and it is probably not the most significant designer and cannvivana than Valentino.
Mango has just published the second year El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is offered at EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandra Beani, the winner of the first year, looked at her proposals yesterday in Manga's window on Haussmann's Paris boulevard number 54 and almost cried through.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and it was just opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The largest is London.
Many events along with the desire to thank the designers Valentin for the adoption of the Presidency of the jury have led us to finally have dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier.
The mango Firema was decorated by a presiding table next to Chagall's most prominent works.
Nati, who had a heartbreaking grief due to her recent death of her brother, had not seen anything, dressed the clothes of this brand and jewels of ELAH, over which he kept his breath hidden, and hung up to his son Luis - almost a two-meter elegana - accompanied Valentin at the head of his table at dinner at his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome, and as a true gentleman, he stayed together with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, because they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónic Cruz, who arrived in a store in - personally designed - pants and shirts and changed to long black, sexy dresses, arrived in the night walk of the Opera by escort Goyi Toled, showed us a ballet test room and in memory of other times caught one of the bars and indicated "grand polié".
Inés Satreová didn't stand for a tour of the palace's nearby buildings, but she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone before leaving.
The next morning, we could love Olivier Martínez's presence - another young man who drives a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel with his own bed sheets and towels and asked for no scents to be used in his rooms.
The stars under the stars of Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - counter-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and cowardly everyday life.
And so that it is not enough, they are all summed up in a book that will bring relaxation into the bookshop on 30 September.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it's even worse to imagine itself absorbed in the rhythm that brings life to life.
The office's called tension and back pain computer.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is not one or two ways to fight everyday exhaustion and the problems of evading from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy in the pages of her book gathered the whole "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
Protistres book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookshop.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline training, which resuscitates balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Sleeping talk
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us anything that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When this happens first, it may be a good start, but it's really meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilocation.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told one of you that he spoke from sleep at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (for example once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the child does not remember anything.
There's only one reason to explain its appearance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night whiteness, enuresis nightturn (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stress or agitated situation.
In any case, it is a little testimonial.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak with a quiet voice, speak words, whisper, or just vice versa (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it is manifested with great strength, it would be appropriate to watch and consult with an expert to see if there is any problem that causes great anxiety and is shown in this way.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another breakdown of sleep that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping a few very simple preventive measures in mind, such as:
Trying to keep the baby out of the way before she goes to bed.
So search for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or series.
It is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them get some inner peace.
That kid will let you sleep peacefully.
When somnyllovia appears, try to remain calm.
Remember, it is harmless for a child and that the next day will not remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Although he speaks, he sleeps, and hence resteth.
Remember, if it seems to you several times that he is very concerned, it would be appropriate to address the advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so usual), avoid temptation to question him and draw information out of him.
It won't do anything, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious of having his thoughts arranged.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and that is why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you are making.
Never tell your kid you can ask him his secret at night.
Not even fun.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't just worry, it's not bad, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory after a long skinny period of time.
Without playing a particularly large game, the yellowies created more chances and managed to turn one of them out.
The game did not have much to do with this conflict, in which the attackers were only hard to promote, too fast.
After the first attempt, the captain of Kauffmann, who shot from a distance only about the train missed the connection, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to irritating the defense of Dannemaria.
On the other hand, the soldier built in half a court of defense and left only the agile Riahhi on the grave.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, thanks to the first two chances of Dannemaria with Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well-established for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53).
Gólman Illhaeusernu, however, did not enjoy the pleasure for a long time, for about 12 minutes he was forced to return to his wardrobe and leave his fellow classmates weak.
But Dannemarie could not make it out of it, and 11 out of Illhaeusern, which just pulled a little down to "kill" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball passed very close to the shore.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Nicolas Sarkozy is going to take a car ride through Brittany before leaving the United States.
To face the demonstrations of the forces of fishermen who have strongly affected the accessibility of several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The last appointed have promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and they hope that "he will come up with specific proposals".
The Presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis Committee" created by the British fishermen in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in the price of oil, which reached the peak of EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson of Elysee Palace, David Martinon and their president "will talk about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their companies regain their competitiveness and better secure the conditions for employment and payment of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be out of line.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out an operation "hungry" (operation slowly driving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of traffic.
A holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections were not interrupted in direction to Belle-île.
A filter dam was launched on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, when they burned tyres and pallets in Concrenau and Saint-Brieuc in front of the storage of the fuel mass of the ports in Brest and Lorent, and they burned the tyres and pallets while there were demonstrations in Concreneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and a canal of la Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trailers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of the ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the block of the important Total Refinery in Donges.
Those at Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act on their own, until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis Committee" is expected to decide on how to continue on a presupposed journey and how to participate in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the state fisheries department who did not support their movement.
"The stand will continue" because "the fishers will not escape from anything" and "they will not go to Paris", said for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorent.
The profession fishermen who do not pay oil tax currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the threshold for the return of the ship is reached only if the oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newcastle the Great
An unforgetable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died from cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or also Sam Mendes bowed to a legend of film and political engagement to Paul Newcastle, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on a delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession, which is above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, retains his supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 added devices, confirmed by his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, in particular has a range of aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer supplied 41 devices to the Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
AIG considers that 15 % of its assets are transferred
The American International Group’s insurance company, which the US monetary authorities have received over water, considers that he would have gone more than 15% of his assets to pay $85 billion that were given to him as an advance, writes a Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the journal, which quotes the sources of a close ongoing negotiations.
According to France, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday during the evening to examine the event.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include its International Lease Financial Corp. its 59% participation in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity are supplied by France France Télécom.
No final decisions have yet to be taken on these submissions, France Télécom continues.
The AIG must obtain cash in a hurry to repay the 85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that it will receive 80% of its capital to the U.S. authorities, thus also dissolution the relevant ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analyses of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
On September 17, 2001, on the date of resumption of trade after terrorist attacks of 11 September, the biggest point in its history (about 684.81 points).
Index Nasdaq with the controlling technological component lost 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,5 points.
From the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally fallen down after the unexpected refusal of the plan to rescue the bank of the House of Representatives, a plan to allow a little stability to be reinvented in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to grant the Secretary of the Treasury to Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two Republicans rejected his plan from three.
"It's a bad signal from the market that sees Congress unable to accept a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was relying on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days does not come "too late".
"If this project is truly condemned to destruction..., the Habitat will immediately be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, see red.) and other central banks to bless the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, Head of the Global Insight Economics.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza said that in the United States "every new day brings down a single financial institution".
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the authorities to buy out the banking activities of Wach's bank's rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn-off and requested urgent interventions in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets do not deal with "only with the American crisis but with the world crisis", he added an analyst from France’s FTN Financial.
The bond market went up strongly.
The proceeds from the cash voucher for 10 years dropped to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday night, the return to 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4.357 % of the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates, the second debate was followed, whose task was to find out who of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republicans and Democrats did not surprise them when they both declared their victory in a television duel that followed a third of American families.
David Gergen's political analyst considers that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in surveys.
The Gallupa Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday, points to Obama's five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Between the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is a 39% winner, while according to the CBS survey, 25% condemns McCain's victory.
Obama should be able to confirm its leadership on Thursday by means of the anticipated good performance of his co-Candanda Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She is gifted," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
The seventy - year - old McCain has consistently highlighted his inspiring experience in the foreign policy field, while stressing his rival's "naiveness" on issues that created the core of the first clash.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." there was repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also has.
In such an emergency spirit, they haven't been since last night's Republican television spots.
On the other hand, Obama pointed out that it was a future.
He didn't lose his head and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He raised his ability to take the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he said on the weekend of a democratic spot, which the Republic calculates that the impact of the crisis on the 'pronged American' is not sufficiently taken into account.
"The 90-minute debate of this John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the electoral meeting in North Carolina for a sharp rain.
He didn't say words as "medium class" or "worker." The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider as more eligible to save the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," estimates the powerful democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democrats, the current disaster "the eight-year-old bad economic policy, as George Bush was running and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Illinois Senator again confirmed that, despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of Americans, and he also pointed out that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its priority number one, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions concerning the financing plan of 700 billion dollars (EUR 470 billion) which was adopted by Congress last night and which is strongly unpopular.
"What did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the capital square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of electoral rooms at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularness of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have yet been declared, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: 'dictator, demise'.
Some admit that the elections didn't go: "What would it be if they were doing with my voice anyway?" said one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been in favour of foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to undertake a turn towards democracy.
Penalties that include the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets could be repealed if the elections are considered clean.
According to the opposition, it wasn't like that.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees and our observers were unable to participate in the census of votes," he complained to Yuri Potęmkin, spokesperson of the Union of democratic forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in Presidential elections in 2006 and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "it's very important who counts the votes, and with us it's a powerful power.
If any opposition MPs get to Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry to Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
For if our economy, deeply indebted with Russia, will be affected by the crisis, and we will not reform ourselves, we are threatened to become a protégé of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, has not declared the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What have you noticed that there have been any choices?" it's about the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the election rooms.
And in Parliament there will be up to five opposition Members, those who comply with the regime most."
The night silence has recovered again in the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and the members of the central electoral committee congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood, which is sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his founding and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was legitimately pleased because Héma-Québec became one of the world's most reliable and effective blood suppliers.
First of all, he regained confidence in the public, who was seriously shaken after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Department of Transfusion of the Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave, the Canadian Government initiated in February 1994 a public investigation, which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such tragedy and formulate recommendations so as not to repeat such disasters.
While Judge Krever was concerned with the submission of the report, some provinces brought in a committee whose aim was to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
The Gélinea Committee has set up this role in Québek.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, who was supposed to manage Québec, and the Canadian blood company for supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people had faith in the Québébé blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
We have regained confidence in the public over the following years," says and proudly adds that Héma-Québek had already trusted almost 94% of the Québa population in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Héma-Québec applied the principle of prudence.
"We have seen in Europe many cases of human illness of mad cows, new variants of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore leaned on one of the basic recommendations of Krewer and Gélineau’s report, which states that if we do not know that and when there is a risk of spreading a serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jabo’s disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, measures should be taken.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping up with the prudence principle had meaning."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests using nuclear acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself, not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
The NAT tests have helped reduce the deaf period, which occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques in the blood may be exposed to the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without finding out.
This improvement allowed to significantly reduce the risk of receiving AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood is today exposed to one of 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first HIV transmission to occur through the blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions needed to heal," says the head of Héma-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what a diseased element might appear in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, a chiungunya virus appeared, similar to that of the West Nile virus, passed into blood by stabbing insects.
Dr. Décary goes on and stresses that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also be counted with sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which is composed on average of only 3% of the Québeans allowed for donation."
Each healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of permissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of people who offer blood are not on average accepted because, for example, AIDS or Malaria wearers, and if they have visited a country where mud winters are excluded for one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a state that fits the needs of hospitals.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, it is necessary to complement the donor network in proportion to their ageing and no longer be able to give blood.
However, to convince people to give blood is difficult, it is especially difficult to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so untangled today that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary will miss.
With the annual budget of $297 million Hema-Qubec adds not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valve, eye tube and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the blood cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedicine waste, flows blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the contribution of our thousands of blood samples from the cord to the bank, and we assume that we would take them over 1,000 a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. Décary, which the blood collection programme of the cord describes them as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they have no access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in the semifinal
Impact Montréal was qualified for the semifinal round of the first USL division last night at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter final played on the total number of goals, thanks to the victory of 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90s game.
After both sideless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino held two goals of montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan for the benefit of Sounders.
Let's remind ourselves that on Friday, during the first of two matches, Impact suffered at Starfire Complete in Tukville, on the suburb of Seattle, defeat 2:1.
Impact will measure its forces in the semifinal with Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota he settled Thunder at home’s definition 3:1 and eventually won 4:3, but Whitecaps joined the semifinal round with a total number of goals 5:4.
Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but they will be confirmed today.
Shortly - Kvalev's winning goal
The first attack threesome of Canada is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovavaleva, Tomáš Plekance and Andreje Costa Rica last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack on the victory of Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Bonostin, the greatest star of clashes, scored goals, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kvalev took down one prize in this fourth victory of three-colored of six preparatory games.
Kovalev ensured victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Russian.
"I need one more game to make me feel good."
"On the first third, he tried to handle too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice smile."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister shall not exclude that by the end of the year he will give rise to early elections
Following the end of the Congress of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Québek, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolducci (left) is running in today's additional elections.
"Extent our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented by yesterday in a visually-sighted manner at the conclusion of the Québek Liberal Party convention in Lévis without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were taken behind his back in a picture mill.
On three huge canvass, there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, like during the electoral period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would have called for early elections in autumn even though he pointed out that he had a very charged programme.
The "Plán Sever" is the fourth dimension of the "vision", which the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of the "new economic area", which includes an agreement with France on the labour force, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North-North Land on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has, recently, often mentioned in his statements, has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister reduced the fact that he explained why Sever represents a "klot with huge potential", but did not mention the term, the amount of investment, or the clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further distributed: especially water power plants, forests, but above all mining sectors, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the recovery of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's reading, contains " Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "save twice as much as France is with us", "is in Québek.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, and he highlighted the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Québeck's engineering, James's bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he's soaked down to see a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Québek's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Québec has always requested, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that repeated all the governments of the present world.
There is one border line, which has not been a convention for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, in the name of the government, I will again take this position," he indicated.
Otherwise, "is in connection with climate change also necessary to rethink our vision of the North," he said when he spoke about the transition of the north-west, which, as a result of iceberging, opens all year round.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that it becomes an obligation to take the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Québébé government would be very thoughtful with them and that their project would be beneficial, especially young.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist Member from Ungava), have already opened negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work began by the interminister committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and has an important position as Julie Bouletová (Repair and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be chosen".
Indeed, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "commonly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a continuous member of the vision of the liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
"Almost as liberals who preceded us, we have changed our thinking to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the still twirled themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail which highlighted Jean Lesage’s 50th anniversary of onset to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to baptise Beauharnois headquarters at Adélard-Godbutov dam.
"From Godbout, founded by Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who conducted the peaceful revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to the Bourass, which created James's bay, was able to shape our side of the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, premiere in 1957 to 1963.
When the line reached the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I only say it among us, but I plan to be there," he said to his Member State base, leading to a great deal of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April, that there would be no election in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, he did not rule out the possibility to call for elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he pointed out that his program was loaded, especially the mission of federal councils in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the chief of the liberals platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular a certain "to change the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Québek) requires in particular the recognition of the "speciality of Québek" in the Constitution.
Québec also wishes to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council, who would have the right to veto in the case of decisions taken in Québek.
On the opposition side, the Sever plan was adopted sceptically in its main features.
Chief of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois once again pulled out the Politics of North Québek, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government got to power in 2003, it failed to fulfil this policy.
If she had been held up to her, "we would have been further today", Marois noted on the side of her candidate Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said she'd support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But let us wish it not to be a mere theatre," Sébastien Proulx explained, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from holiday today.
Letters - Disappointed Country
He was Vic Toews, an ex-Minister of "justice" (O irony) in Harper's cabin, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer, that he represents a "hab" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who led an unscrupulous fight for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, tells many of the prime minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government that, as the only one of all Western countries involved, did not bring back to the country of its national, closed in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that at the time when the actions that were against him were to take place was Omar Khadr a young adolescent.
The only government that, even though Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaves the child soldier rotting in the inhuman conditions.
The only one depending on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Let us remind ourselves that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and in particular the Association of Canadian lawyers defend the repatriacs of Omar Khadra, so that he can wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government shuts its eyes in front of torture: it is not enough that this young man is also psychologically destroyed, and it has undoubtedly endured, after so many years of suffering.
We don't realize that, but we're just seeing the live erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "demcracy", the words that Harper's driving with so much and which is so empty out of his mouth.
There has come a time when no morale is present: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to deal with him badly, to arrest him according to any authority of the minority government so far (as will be after 14th October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims the virtue, the Law and the Order: they cannot see that this government has given away what created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's Discussions of Barrick Gold
In September 17th, Le Devoir printed Patrick J. Garver's letter, an executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With orwell's logic, he confirms that the world's largest manufacturer of gold has begun investigating three authors and a poor little publisher for insulting on honor, with the aim of calling for a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million after them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in case of prosecution for insulting honor, but law.
It is no surprise that Garver is completely confused by this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to bring to the face of anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the trial occurs, authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend the respectable sums to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by nearly-free pockets of mining companies.
The tactics in these unbalanced fears often lie in the ruination of the defendants for the sake of a conciliation, which clogges the mouth of the anti-trust, and in addition assists anyone who dares to pay this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have introduced her view of the whole matter to the public opinion.
In spite of what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold works, there is a debate in Canada under normal circumstances in the exchange of thoughts and not in the mornings of a bottle.
Therefore, mining companies were not sufficient to open their books, their documentation and to establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no trust in public opinion and smudge rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada's book.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" and, at the same time, reject the public's views?
It seems that this word in the Vice President's world is marked by only fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy they have the right to speak to the Nazis.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports Noir Canada's authors and publishers, so it does, in particular, because it rejects brutal forms of mining society.
The public is ready to hear and assess the matter, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, not in the context of what many see as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be killed (in the context of his pursuit of "public debates" by Barrick, by the way, has just given an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce to them that they should stop using this term...).
If we skip the surreal Garver's speech, pursuing the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university freedom of research and finding the truth that is essential for every democratic society.
In general, he denies the right to quote credible resources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the basis for intellectual action itself.
If it's in a country like Canada, it's impossible to study and discuss topics that don't like the rich companies of this world without being subject to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be formed if it followed by scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university's environment, where we belong, is already able to manage debates and disagreements and deal with conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s overcrowded action clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to implement measures that would limit such an unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush’s administration and leaders of Congress both the Republicans and the Democrats came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest rescue economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, such as the help of 700 billion US dollars to offend the financial crisis, which has been clouding Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized for non-payment and also the right to follow the amount of wages paid to managers of the rescue companies.
American Finance Minister Henry Paulson, Prime Minister of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosiová and the Republican Representative at the meeting table, Senator Jud Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
"It was all done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans would be safe from the crisis right now on Wall Street," explained the Democrat.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos, and interference in the everyday lives of Americans will be huge," the Republican Judd Gregg said.
During the last hours of negotiations, negotiations took place at the highest turn of fear from the effect of further failure to settle investors.
The time limit determined was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later, and they both expressed themselves in favour of the agreement rather than forgetting their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a regional solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added an agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to allow owners to maintain their residence, and measures on the mass of the leaders of the State-protected companies.
"If we ask taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate on.
However, these measures are necessary," explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see details, but I hope so."
"The cool features I've read show that it's about something we're all going to have to spend and with what will be possible to move on.
Choose an inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700-billion plan is to buy doubtful claims and risk-free and non-sales assets from US financial institutions for money from taxpayers.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the crackdown of bubbles in the real estate market, which first led to a collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to further, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and in the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The impact of the first draft agreement last week has on the Republicans' conscience.
From the time the Democrats came to the conclusion that, for some "toxic" assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only run the government, but it will not buy them, there is the belief that the impenetrable situation is being blessed.
In order to bring the anti-agency views closer to Congress, measures have been put in place to determine that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help her get her deposit back if he has to collect losses for five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan calculates the first amount of 250 billion to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should approve Congress in a new vote.
In return for Washington's help, he gets shares in the saved companies, which in case of profit will pay him dividends and which he can sell again when he's done.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the detention of real estate relating to loans covered by the plan as well as setting limits for the amount of the assessment and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The members of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, both the Republican and the Democratic Camp raised their voices against this project.
"It is absolutely obvious that Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Financial Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on charges is not a solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, a moderator of a group of congressmen called "the selection of skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but there is the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel prizes, wrote to us, "We ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to issue," he said yesterday.
At the same time in Europe, it has been confirmed again that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of Fortis's Group for EUR 11,2 billion (16,3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it departs from the purchase of its competitors, which has been on the edge of the collapse since it lost 2 billion euros (EUR 2,9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risk credits to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the top twenty European banks and among the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," declared Dutch Minister of Finance Woter Boss yesterday.
"In return, we get election law in the bank and influence.
And these are just promoters and households in today's uncertain times they can appreciate."
On the other hand of the Channel La Manche so far, it seems, the British Government has launched the nationalization of other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion USD (75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to his last notification, he will buy out branches and accounts from British banks of the Spanish Bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to national from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newcastle (1925-2008) - Death of socialised icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his triumph, according to other weakness.
Was this American actor with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and unscrupulous talent that he owns also gave him away from the power category that gives birth to real stars.
But what a runner for a long track!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat American cinematography.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was like him and for a long time was his rival on a film screen, better actor, for I to be fragile, but also the apostle of freedom and the dissolution of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born from these European roots.
Without an excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it the whole country was seen in love with self made man, a fighter in the Pacific War, injured in a battle that at the beginning of the 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theater, on television and on the occasion of the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer, who placed himself as the second on the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, even though he had been a model couple with Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also leaves the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the habit of own show-businness, which will always remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense of words.
Paul's departure this weekend caused the lovers of the movie, while his great role together compete on the black screen of memories.
After that, more than half a century, the transforming American seventh art has been found.
In memory, the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990) we entertain his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newman have gone into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziono, a cruel, violent, unforgettable delicacy from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, was taken over after his death, which was mentioned in 1956 by Newcastle in a true knowledge.
Sympathic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vulnerabilistic ball player in the awesome The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure will appear in The Color of Money Martin Scorese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
That face of a floating age, that's him.
He's back again.
In his professional course, they compete with different epochs.
Young people mainly know him thanks to Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from Reggie Dunlop's role, an unusual hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Coen's brothers.
He then completed his career as a godfather of Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends, which quite soon left the craftsman in the business for a long time, although he judged Hollywood with his prophesy, detestableness, and retribution.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "for a live call from underplaying", judging that in his performance he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role they came to as a stand, the profession was not always as tender as the profession.
But the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despairs, whose fall and riots were reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed little known sites of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, from 1968, according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence, in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the lead, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who lost because of the overdose, was dedicated to Harry and Son's film in 1984, a work full of shame and well.
In the flooding of honors that have been made to John, his great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played together in The Sing and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) regrettedly: "His presence has done my life and the better."
Happiness, love for life, these are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we skip his legendary career, he also leaves a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of Hollywood bankruptcy.
His likeness was used to seeing wine vinegar bottles, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which might seem a bit awkward, although initially it was a gag.
However, profits from sales went to his Foundation account for a hard childhood.
But better than letting him enjoy his glory, he's been engaged in society until the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following words: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the course of life of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in a factory on the invoices of Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon on October 8th, he will begin his term in criminal proceedings against Janos Zuschlag and his associates.
Police and its associates are, in addition to other crimes, including counterfeiting of the instrument, accused of fraud committed in the long-term and systematic criminal organisation, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the D.A., they used the money obtained in public competition for their own purposes and often provided false invoices.
Money from the state and self - totaling about 65 million forints - were transferred in part to the register of the Fiat Balldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money received in public competitions were collected on the basis of invoices for which no actual counter-evaluation was involved and that the associations' obligations had never stopped.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoice was fake.
The copies of these invoices came from the józsefváros market, a round stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On the names of which the company is to produce invoices, it has decided, among other things, on the circular route along the northern shore of Balaton, to which Istvaán Ladose Janos Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to see the guesthouses and restaurants.
In their request for consumption accounts, according to which the invoices presented in the framework of the public competitions published by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, were then produced in the context of such public competitions as the Ministry of Youth and Sport.
The invoices were mostly issued by Istvaán Lados with his associate Andras ïrim, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "study trip" Lados looked at one of the beers.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, this hospitality food facility provided for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont Group.
However, so many people would not have entered this facility according to the company’s management’s claim.
In the same way, the foundation named Jobb Jövöért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert, was grounded by the formal and content errors of the invoice in the summer of 2002.
The guest house in Badacsont had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet hundreds of thirty guests were shown on the invoice.
The fillers with rich fantasies, however, overdid it even when they put on the documents the company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. o., in which accounts according to the information provided to the state representative of documents entitled Jobb Jövöért and Hoppá did not even set up.
The head of the company Győző Farkas for Hvg.hu said that when they called him to the D.A. and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was a fake document.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to formality, it did not agree that 100 people were accommodated by invoices, because there are only 11 rooms that do not have the capacity.
Furthermore, food was also mentioned on the invoice, with their restaurant not working for a long time.
The hot invoice producers did not even convince that the observed Budapest travel agency is organising only foreign routes, and on cash payment invoices, which also did not match the company's invoice practices, they referred to the foolish as a service of intermediation of travel in Hungary.
Moreover, as has been seen in the course of the investigation, VAT has also been included in the document, although the organisation of routes to countries outside the European Union has been exempt from VAT.
On the four documents exposed to the Foundation, the Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, to the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 % VAT, but the 15 % VAT, except the staff of the hotel had only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by the hands.
In addition, they ruined the "contractors" of an invoice, due to the fact that one company stated, as a result of the investigation of a state representative, as an activity carried out by the road transport of goods which the company founded originally on investment advice did not carry out.
The invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert and the 21st associations are invoices issued. The Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont false were also involved because of formal deviations - the non-corresponding format of invoices and false stamps.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. was at the time (2001) during which the group at Fiatal Városért, was eating, in liquidation, because of our information, the company’s liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
The invoices showed consciously
The second group of invoices consists of those who knew they should issue a fictional invoice.
Esély Budapest has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiat Balldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
Collab s. r. o. made one of the accused Ludovic Györfi’s claims to issue a fictional account.
Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s. o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the foundation of Jobb Jövöért and the Association of Atlasz and Vörösfeny’s invoices worth approximately five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Neither the movement of money, because the invoices created were later stored, which, of course, left the organization to show in their documents.
Other groups of invoice companies include those who had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the appointed representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not found.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd, which had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was the man of Romania, who was supposed to transmit letters concerning the company as well as Iván Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, the Cubans admitted during the investigation that, on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to the associations of Atlas, Hoppá and the Foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredert and accepted their counter-evaluation.
In response to the request of Ivána Kubatov, Romanian leaders were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, neither of the companies really worked, according to the defendant's claim that they didn't get the job.
However, he was benefitted by the companies, because at the request of Zsolta Szento, who had also prepared their letter of deposit, he issued on behalf of companies invoiced by the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14,2 million forints.
The State Council found that Cuba came to 10 percent of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictional invoices, this time for a selection procedure for the Biztos Pont, a man also used the company Shi-Beri k.t.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals for a public competition on Mihalye Táncsics (TMA) in January 2006.
They gained 500 thousand forintech, but they did not spend the money on the targets set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at home at the office of Arpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, part of the defendant is likely to describe the course of the invoice production, as it has already done in the procedure.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself the main defendant Janos Zuschlag.
His previous statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised a number of times that he will interpret everything widely, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it's in his interest - in exchange for a large amount of damage, 50 million forints, maybe the socialists made an agreement with him, and Zus will take it on himself.
He could also have been taken away so far, since his requests for the relief of his detention conditions, namely the placement of the prison, were not heard until now.
While perpetrators of economic crimes who have suffered much more damage that they have not yet paid up can freely pass or at least wait to the end of their conduct in their homes, he does not have that option.
Psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overrun goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior has managed to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of New York University.
According to their studies, published in Science magazine, people do not want an eBay auction contest, so they'd rather pay too much price.
Research, using the experimental auction, tried to map a scheme of this "hry" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers was planted, the second group participated in a playful auction, using a functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) to examine the active area of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, but in playing in an auction, whose important element is to overflow the other side, the whole, located under the brain bone, began to work intensively during losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "sebelation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible, according to the researchers, to explain the attempt to avoid a sharp reaction of striata.
In order to undermine their theory, members of the research team carried out financial cross-cutting investigations from a number of economists.
Under different conditions, three groups were bid against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they were to come out of the game, they would get $15 for the reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of the loss, her members lost this money.
The difference between the two groups therefore included everything in the fact that one was highlighted by win and another loss.
Of course, the members of the group playing "anti-crime" were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "win" group, which confirms the hypothesy of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For you, until now, have explained the wonders when auctioning joy from victory and avoiding risk.
When the neurological imaging methods helped us solve the conflict between these two theories, so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schitter, professor of the University of New York.
hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only 7 thousand of them are treated. The reason is that sick people often do not know that they are infected.
The name of the hepatitis is the summarizing of infectious liver damage caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, the inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the origins of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from one another.
Virs of hepatitis are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E by digestive organs (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, blood secret, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, and there is no vaccine type C virus.
Signs of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected meals, usually associated with nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, requiring vomiting.
Then, the jaundice, light stool and dark urine form on the skin and eye whites. Treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people across the world die of this disease, liver cancer, and liver cystosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only every tenth infected medically treated.
Hepatic hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver circulation or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease even do not know, the cause of the disease destroys liver cells in the gut, so the first symptoms occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent, to make regular write-downs.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than in average: amongst people who had transfusioned blood, between drug users and tattoo people before 1991.
Currently, the estimated global number of subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is forecast.
Since the disease can show routine laboratory tests, one should, if any signs of unknown origin are recorded, contact his practical physician.
In early detection, the disease is healing, the virus can be removed from the body, and so prevents infectiousness and prevent cancer.
September 30th is a world day of hepatitis, which was organized for the first time by organisations representing sick people worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to alert the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researched how faith in a person affects the God of perception of pain, informed the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers were subjected to the same number of electric shocks while they were all watching the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a detailed examination of the human brain, it also showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating the pain.
Research is the first of the series of research, involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was exactly done by attaching to the left hand of the experimental body the spark plug-in tool that issued electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to carefully observe two paintings: the Sassoferrats of the Virgin Mary originating in the 17th century and the lady with the edge of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
Research authors hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain state of godlyity in the believers, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it was too different from the first one and it was a calming impression.
Testimonials spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during this time they got 20 electrics in four consecutive parts of each other, while they watched the picture separately with religious or general subjects.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe," as if they were "the caretakers" and "require themselves, they made them peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain when they had Leonard’s work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved through any strongly impressive image even with ateists, it is only necessary to find the right photo.
"We should find a painting that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The conservation of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only the question of what effect the faithful pain control would have if they showed them some madone from Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would it mean a look at the quality of Miss Maria's achievement of even better results?
You're what you're about to share
Google can claim about its tenth birthdays that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky over their heads; they know where they were on vacation, where they go professional examination and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses is still not enough.
However, as regards sceptics making parallel with orwell's dark vision, these are not clearly the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt has recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data on users, which is necessary for Google's founders to keep their original intention, which he said: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to Googlu, even ten years later, the company is only in the beginning to be able to work with all information.
The question, what's in five years, Schmidt said that if Google could answer questions like, "What should I do tomorrow?" or "what job would actually be good for me?" - But for such seemingly simple questions, softwares will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know that, during their online search, the search words and what IP addresses have been searched for and what pages interested in searching for have moved.
Thanks to Personalized Search, started two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, look back at what they were looking for and click on what they then generate in a long-term perspective the findings tailored to them much more directly - the same logic will be based on the service of Recommendations, which will enable us to offer products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - they ask the users who look at Google's data monopol fear.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by a company does not cause guilt in users in the Internet, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only captured, but may also be issued by a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the rights of internet users do not prevent anything.
The most famous example of recent years was probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles during which provided Google to the Brazilian government information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community web pages of Orkut, established through it.
Internet users who are concerned about personality rights, however, could still breathe in May when the company’s hand in hand with the EDF’s electronic rights organisations has successfully proved their truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced in the future by any article of the Constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought up almost 50 thousand web addresses and thousands of searched expressions that have obtained a call for reinforcements prior to the adoption of the Act on the Protection of Children, but it has not been able to obtain lists of searchable items of individual users, as well as complete lists of websites and key words covering a period of two months.)
Google’s view is so vast: it is being beaten by those who fear the provision of their personal data because it feels that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google’s services, exposed to harm, and taking up against it with a revolution that belongs to multinationals with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild velvet, grouping around each other excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it a new generation of bigfier, "corporation, what it is now," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered by Windows as conquerors of the world, as both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google, unlike Microsoft, not requiring its users to identify and want money for their applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package programs act as a much more accessible, more youthful, "coolier" than the practice of official software defense.
However, it can also be due to the fact that the gays understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and the personality rights that brought with them just one of the most inclined keywords of the last years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their range for each other, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can run a profile on a few community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter orlast.fm applications, recording it with listening music, all of which can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides writing a blog that automatically discovers its latest photo gallery that saves on Flickru or Picase.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exponential cases: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of his friends together easily finds out who her sage friend spent the evening with, or can fire his worker just because he's willing to express his sincere opinion on the top management on his blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life today has completely re-evaluated.
Whoever lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basics behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you want to hide something or at least avoid google monopol, you have the option (if you need Skankit, which uses Google’s search system, but does not leave your feet on purpose).
For example, a small number of people can not be found on the community sites in order to avoid finding them. Online applications Google from the text editor to photoeditor and the news portal can be replaced as alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and which will not set up the best possible profile.
Public opinion is secretly expected by Google to show teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion greater than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($24 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising agencies and services are being threatened with an ever-increasing pace of the life not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software designers.
Critic observers, however, also find counterpoints that cause alarming impressions: for example, the management has completely rejected the protests of employees after having raised a double fee for corporate school, any frequent daily eating of employees was too expensive according to the company’s management, all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google has fallen before the Chinese government in 2006 and, within the meaning of their agreement, it has found every finding that is due to good taste, respect for the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that there is never a new service, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can move the world to new places: while some believe that the Googlu project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have something to do with the American Supreme Court, others are scared of its health system, in which we can set up a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for the following generations of sci-fi writers, the famous novel Cory Doctor's "Sciffed" describes with orwell's reminiscences of the future, in which one can easily approach a person with the help of Google data.
Two-time killers from the A.R. helped remove the tracks of two youths.
Two juveniles interviewed the police in the case of double homicide in Odz, according to reasonable suspicion, they helped to remove the traces of this crime, said on Tuesday the spokesperson of the Chief Police Directorate of the Borsod.
People have experienced activity from which they have been suspected and are currently accused of aiding a crime.
Both youths, according to the information of the MTI two girls, are being prosecuted for freedom.
Supporting crime is punishable by the retribution of freedom for up to 5 years.
Suspect of double homicide in Odęd, 23-year-old man here, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a criminal suspect in a pre-planned multiple murders for bad reasons.
During the investigation, it appeared that a 23 - year - old man owed a 53 - year - old man a larger amount.
The suspect didn't want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor in the last center to a facility in Odza where he killed the man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, a young man prepared to commit a crime in advance, indicating that he committed a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapons and circumstances of its use are examined by police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw storm made an offer on the purchase of Prague storms
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a 100% share of Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party even though the Czechs of the Warsaw Stock Exchange excluded from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange earlier.
The reason for this is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is to stand.
99 percent of shares are in the hands of the Polish State that wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that was offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech Letters, the Vienna Stock Exchange of securities, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have yet to be offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic expressed himself last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and he did not rule out that it could lead to the destruction of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts in stock markets to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The biggest owner of the Prague Share Exchange is Patria Finance's investment bank with approximately 25% share followed by the Czech Spouselna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the point of view of European lists
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists are already reminded of "the second time of September 11".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, raise charges by the Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to make his own party to support the quick-to-be bill of law, which aims to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, who was reminded by a millionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11th.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the guilty man in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo brought the world economy to the edge of collapse there, the lack of political leadership.
The dangers of the collapse of the US financial system are constantly growing, for which they will eventually pay the whole world.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, it is at risk that Washington will not offer a political tool to address the crisis.
World economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism are taking place.
The threat can no longer be forgotten, points to the women's journal Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw away a rescue ring in the vulnerabilities, and taxpayers can save them from the crash.
However, if another bank's dominance collapses as the dominases, then it will not be enough money or other improvisations.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union need to move across their national selfishness and unite control of the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday, more than 100 billion euros have been received by the current monetary institutes, it recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which says that, like Americans, they will have to go deep into the pocket and European taxpayers, more and more real, in order to solve the crisis.
The European Union is facing a crisis, which has not been seriously concerned with the Old Continent as well.
"Arbiters" may not now be worth EUR stamiliards, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers in order to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car imitates the flight of a gill
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not the immitation of barriers to the world of nature?
For example, at the bee.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEAEC fair, inspired engineers from Nissan czmelác. It was about how to build a new generation of systems that prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has constructed a biomemetic robot management system of the BR23C, a robot mineuuta, which is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim to help create a system that can eliminate all precipitations.
"By the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our protective packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of the brand for the field of technology PR and research and development.
A major role is played by together eyes that allow bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions in the clear angle.
The engineers reached the feature of the composite eye after the idea of a laser long-range.
This identifies obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres before the BR23C in a clear field of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends the onboard microprocessor a signal that is immediately converted into an operation aimed at avoiding precipitation.
The crossover is captured during a fraction of a second, then the roboted car starts imitating the movement of bees and turning wheels to the extent necessary to prevent precipitation immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a totally instinctive way.
"If it wasn't so, a robot car could not react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiuki Ando, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately because this technology complies with the most vulnerable and inner layer of safety packaging, within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than a blink of the eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downs or angles, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotation, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer durability than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, an instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process is important, the less storage data.
This mechanism must process and react only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to keep them and respond to them using intuitive logic based on the dates of the previous maneuvers, which is why they use only a memory of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need memory with a giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technologies used for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan's estimate, could get into serialised cars within ten years.
Another possibility of applying can be the connection of the GPS satellite navigation system, which will lead the motorist to the intended final target after the exit of the road.
She's already got a name for the precious baby.
The law on the package to save the economy worth $700 billion, which is to be divided into several instalments, and the aim of which is to buy quality bank loans is already in writing.
Half of the amounts will be used in the first round.
After further meetings, which ended on Saturday after midnight of the American Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days' ongoing debate on the rescue package worth a total of 700 billion dollars, Reuters told.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the conclusion of the agreement remains.
Both Barack Obama and John McCain presidents supported the compromise on the package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson stated on the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further action needs to be taken."
The written similarity of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock in Washington City Time (i.e. Monday at 2 o'clock in Central European Time), but no special rise in storms caused.
The 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be set up, will be voted by the Chamber of Representatives on Monday, then a series of Members will be held at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the deal was welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and we very much appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said the spokesperson of the White House Tony Fratta.
The program is different from the original design of Bush administration, in which it was intended to be used to buy poor-quality securities secured by mortgages, all of a sudden, total of 700 billion dollars.
Now it is possible to spend up to half the sum of 700 billion in the first, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the things expected on Monday will decide Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities secured by mortgages which are rated as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by the Special Assembly, the member of which will also be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of 700 billion dollars will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can apply the combined tactics within the meaning of the Act: it can also buy quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "at least" loans.
The purchase may take place within the auction and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry have communicated.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for the means of providing a reason for concern, and will then pay the company a price corresponding to the amount of damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, up to 700 billion dollars, whether it is an extensive purchase of bad funds, their insurance or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutes.
"We will make the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The bosses of the bank that got into trouble and waiting for state help, may, on the contrary, count that the government will reduce their distance - which in the overseas slang says simply "Golden Fall."
They will only be limited in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the way of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry is to buy in the context of the auction, a tax credit will be imposed on gold parachutes if the bank's fallen directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of direct redemption of quality credits, the government will aggressively step up in order that the money for management is not overrun.
It is necessary to add that the existing Treaty on Gold Falls will not change, the restriction concerns only new contracts, which is to be further stimulated to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in the American history, when legal restrictions on remuneration of the CEOs will be applicable," said President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Mr. Barney Frank.
In addition, the State holds a right in banks participating in the scheme to obtain a share, which will reduce the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and the rescue bank stand on their feet, they can also make money at this transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must present a proposal to Congress to determine how taxpayers of expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered.
Of course, there were the voices expressing in relation to the plan of doubt on both sides.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this is not what the taxpayers' dollars are about to protect," the Republican Congressman of California Darrell Issa said.
His democratic colleague in Ohio, Mary Kapturová, believes that the adoption of the provisions was what was right for those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

Barack Obama and McCain are for bank rescue packages
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both the great American parties, agreed on Sunday to provide their support for a government package worth $700 billion, but there are also politicians who demand a finance minister's demise.
Following a few days of Marathon's meeting of Congress and the administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement on the bank rescue package was concluded.
The financial package aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain all agree to be more appropriate of both candidates to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, at the same time as they got into the economic question, Obama gained a certain advantage again, and McCain's head start to secure Sarah Palin's nomination after the Republican convention as vice president.
Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package law would be adopted by Congress on Sunday at the electoral meeting in Detroit.
He stressed that the proposal contained liabilities relating to consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act now, in response to your places, your savings, the whole industrial sector, the stability of the entire economy," he said before the 35th century crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain said in an interview provided by the television station ABC: "It's gonna be a bit of an argument... but nothing is simply possible."
As the Republican Senator stated, the proposal sets up a commission to monitor the Minister of Finance and to limit the distance to the senior representatives on which he insisted.
Obama said for the CBS station that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations; he himself was alone with the minister in daily contact.
Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.
Preview of the German Language Area press
The right camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more self-confident - so it analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent oro-black coalitions.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution, devours his father" the causes of a dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a known political scientist, the CSU’s erosion began much earlier than its office took over the sad dueo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the whole Christian democracy is a problem, and so is Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not entirely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday he finished a process that could have been anticipated for nearly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state-party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time under 50 years under 50.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to Bundestag in 2005, i.e. in the so often mentioned period of Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernisation, which CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which devours its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but at a rate they have been very mistaken. Sacularization, education results, the settlement of the Germans from the east and from the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria could not, however, be without result in the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
Modernization is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more self-confident, more critical, more violent.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, CSU has been most distant in the classic civil layer; people in a free profession, trademen, individuals with seniority and with higher education.
By that, the support of CSU is already under 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepress.com)
In his article entitled "Who, who, with whom, are the presidents with whom are the coalition held," he deals with confused intrapolitic situations arising from Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to act with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP commissions the transfer of the SP into its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all the negotiations, the greens are not yet to be agreed on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is going around the coalition; in the debate held in public law television, the chairmans did not have much view of their cards.
The President of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is certainly possible - in some countries and in a social partnership.
The question is whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted for each fall.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, so far it is fully open, these questions must be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
President BZÖ Jörg Haider was once again in all directions.
"In order to prevent oro-black coalitions, we are prepared to take up government responsibility," said Haider.
Spring: You have to break the enchanted circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which France hosts, the current President of the State of the European Union, began.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional debate in her message addressed to the plenary, turned attention to the Segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The conference began - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The negotiations were held among the representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Press Office of the Euro MPs, Fidesz Jaroková pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the recruitment of labour, Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market mainly by their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
It further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early schooling of Romani children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these contexts in the widest circles - among Romani and non-Roman children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more chances he will become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes, they will contribute to the national budget.
"Roma is the right of their national citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their lack of quality and separate education," said Lívia Jaroková.
According to the Member State, the cohesion of the European Union is necessary with the emphasis on the aim and negotiations in order to immediately speed up the processes of desegregation of schools, which is crucially important to ensure that existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are correctly respected.
"It is necessary to break through the enchanted circle of poverty, Segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the possibility of a given democratic space so that they can participate in the future of Europe as legal citizens," Járóková requested.
Each is a sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' guaranteed the European Summit of Equality, organised every year from the meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to remove discrimination, expressed at European and national level.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the reserving dua Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debate, the debate on personal issues has yet to be postponed to the tops of Bavarian CSU.
The President of the Party Erwin Huber and the Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still stay in their seats, the question is, when this grace will continue.
The extraordinary congress of the Party will decide on the fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes.
In any case, members of a very critical duea were able to hear that they would not lie on their posts by all means.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the factions and the base, which, due to the loss of absolute majority, required the day after the 'Bavor Cunami' to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago, the truth, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, was acquired by the Christian-Social Union of 60.7 percent, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength was enough.
In Bavaria, CSU was a "self-control" German GDP for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern Federal Land, which have a key importance for Hungarian economies, they will continue to have a high position, but in future they will in any way be forced to coalition.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of a close intelligence team, which will open the probes for a possible coalition of the monk government with a liberal FDP, and with a right-oriented group of free voters, will also be the Vice-President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible successor of Huber.
It is the irony of fate that Gabriel Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber took advantage of the dueo Huber-Beckstein to execute the punk, but then the ambitious communal police made an immitious short trial.
The leaders of CSU are now focusing all their energy on how Beckstein can stabilize.
In the transitional period, the active role of Stoiber will also be played by former Prime Minister and former President of the CSU on 28 September, who had so far played the greatest political career of his.
On Monday, Huber spent several toxic notes on CDU's address, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Another CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning even for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played at a national success in 2005, plays a significant role, by common forces, will somehow not build on its feet.
According to Merkel, which, because of fiaskey, was hard to conceal its disappointment, there will be no loss of CSU's position to the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating an early CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social Democrats continues.
SPD reached 18.6% in Bavaria with the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not one opposition Member has been given to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illegalities that occurred during the reading of votes.
The election was not recognised by the OBSE which sent 450 observers from 43 countries.
Although 110 members of the 10 million country's legislative congregation lack the opposition for a good ten years, the opposition combined under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's election really hoped that Lukashenko, who had, on the basis of a change in the Constitution's elections with the debate process in 2006 and the fourth renewal of its presidential mandate, this time, ' permission' for several opposition Members to appear in Parliament.
ODS has dropped it from a previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition, it was that, in Russia, economically increasingly dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the constantly healing Russian gas imports, took credit and contributed to the failure of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines going through the countries, had been given a Russian hand - wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment, assessed as anti-democratic Lukasenko and other high political positions, they did not receive an entry permit.
The release previously indicated that the OBSE put emphasis on positive moves in the evaluation of the election campaign and not on shortcomings - for example, on the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OBSE Monday flash report had already had reservations for the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not basically appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present with the reading of votes.
At the same time, it can be felt in the political system: political prisoners were released from freedom, and Minsk is willing to go with Moscow as well as minor confrontations, when it continues to reject Georgia’s severed South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is formed on the union paper, considers this two territory an independent one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that we have started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevic.
According to the opposition candidate from the Presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that this remain so, even though "the power of the power to put a single member of the opposition into an unfamiliar parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, protest actions are not planned, rather than trying to deliver their message to the voters about the necessity of economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, the opposition leaves need to be printed in Russia, distribution puts obstacles to the local authorities, but I still see that the change supports more and more people, even among the elders," said Milinkevič, pointing out that the Lukasek regime, which considers its greatest success to be the creation of social security, does not consider the right or officially most supported layer of pensioners.
"For the country's indebtedness and growth of trade deficits, it is only a matter of time when the social security of the 'incline of the cemetery' collapses," said Milinkevic.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers assessed the election as democratic.
Head of the Community Mission of Independent States of Serbia Lebedev, Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the ripening of the white voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast before work"
It is the first time in history of Palace Chigi, which was introduced by a rotating door when the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new action will start against the masculine people, against those who inject themselves, and then they will go to coffee at work.
The news against the butlers was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renata Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the President's Council of Maure Masi.
"A rotating door - says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more preferences and more services" states the Minister.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
These are reformism," said Brunetta.
We will complete the introduction of Chigi in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees' side, the secretary general assures: "This was a common procedure with all workers and cooperation".
Just no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "it's no better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at a higher vocational school for public administration
in Rome, the Minister finally announces that during three months the absence of public workers for disease decreased by 50%, that means 60,000 people a year more at work".
And he adds that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay dynamic – explains the Minister – has doubled over the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees came together to reject Brunett's decrees in accordance with the Codacons supported applications.
"Until today the Minister for Public Administration presents ciphers concerning whose absence at work due to illness," says the association for consumer protection – the nation of 'peagles' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public service employees gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree."
Taru will protest in particular against the exclusion of sickness allowance which depends on the activities; the extension of the time in which the disease can be checked within which time limits for inspection visits will be carried out and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Working injuries, Napolitana: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents will happen, three people will die, and twenty seven will remain permanent.
The values of Inail confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1.200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values testify to the severity of the evidence, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice the death compared to the murders.
In order to reinvigorate the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all the Italian regions 58th national day of the victims of accidents on the second Sunday in October.
"A worrying date extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of job security is" confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolano in the report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozens and Wheels for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State is expressing its living admiration of continuous joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Unnaturally, 'most' has been raised, an honest shared face to face tragedy, which, by its range, generates a riot in the media and public opinion, but the everyday reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamism."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives put forward in the field of education are of particular importance for young people who face the world of work to gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber pointed out, "how is the death of a work accident creating an absolutely critical social condition, as it undermines the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the need to end this state."
"With regard to the dates of accidents at work, it appears that some positive turnovers are reported, however, does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from an accident is as alarming as possible", said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't just want this "reduction effort" to lead to a little attention, because the moment the attention is stopped, the tragedy will go off.
"We believe that, in general, it is doing too little to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, that Mercandelli stressed – to increase control and inspection, but also to more strongly intervene in the field of training of workers, starting from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion cooperation.
But there is a more sense of responsibility for employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon.'
Mercandelli finally declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of right to compensation envisaged for the work victims and the "removement of supportive care" to which the system has been given in recent years. "
"The purpose of this is to return them to a guarantee worker – he added – because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneousity or the giving of time from time to time by the legislator".
The MP3 player accused, exhibiting hearings of risk
Listen to loud music for longer periods and use portable music instruments as Mp3 player may cause permanent damage to hearing.
According to today's published European Commission notification, which, in one official report extended to Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which recently rose up and has been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion – we read in notes – it shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable musical instruments for at least five years, per week more than an hour and maintain a device at high volume risk of permanent loss of hearing skills".
"I am worried that so many young people who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones on high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way" admits Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – it continues to lead – it results in a clear risk and needs to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them completely effective and to keep up with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"The leaders – conclude the executive official Eu – confirm that there is a need to be concern and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties which have raised the problem, what measures could be possible to introduce or better protect children and young people from making noise that is the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns arise as to hearing damage that can be caused by the exposure of similar forms of noise.
It is possible to very reduce these damage by looking for solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will only exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk a lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such instruments and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will allow the Commission to proceed freely for the future of the capital
We'll start today, close in March, we'll have money in June.
This is the calendar given to Campidogli by the staff of "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met in its new headquarters behind the Caracall baths this morning.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will set up instructions for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will review the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councillor Gianni Almann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included – it wants to highlight Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which eventually will use political decisions that remain of Giunta e General Council.
It's not an exchange of functions, it's just an effort to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved because this institution must have a precise period of time.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has done for the future of Rome's capital."
Whoever accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will say, "It is all up to the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If the Commission’s proposals for Attali are of quality, and I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics will spread out on everyday problems and on the urgency that will occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not cost the euro and serve to think and involve the best intelligence the capital has."
For Alekmann, essentially, "the strategic sketch should be as starting point, neither definitive nor impulsive to allow our city a authentic rise at the level it needs, and to think united in its future."
The future, which clarifies the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to current municipal borders, but will look far beyond" not only in the opinion of the future Metropolitan City and its legal status, the capital, but "the same will include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, knows why.
A famous American president wrote that he was important to him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today's private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks against Obama are rising right now when the election date is coming.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web, "This man is full of ambitions.
But Obama has a crush: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of the nation, which had all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: he will be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act by heart and not by brain.
One paper from the Mississippi, from the work of the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth, we know who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One side of the U.S. mentality will be rejected, which has remained liquid until the last minute.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who to check if Obama or McCain is involved."
There are people who swear, if Obama was to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush's main weapon is.
They asked 1500 people: what errors did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, he lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become an Iraq for most of the Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to Georgie W's place will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapses also felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center has been asked by five hundred journalists to become their profession and provide for the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the requests openly did not say that they were less concerned about credibility.
She doesn't feel isolated like she used to.
The problem is the American journalists' money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is the crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, cuts made in the newsroom, in a room where editors work to put together newspapers are a huge problem.
According to the journalists asked, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional Journalism to change substantially, as the public understands it.
The American journalist passes through clear but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten pressmen and executive seniors believe that the newspaper is in a bad way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
It's printed against the beard.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website goes.
Greater publishers take the road to the Internet, where many look like "killer" printing.
"Economic pressure" by journalists increased by 79%.
Five hundred asked journalists admitted that they were moving towards technology in the hope that for their newspaper, "doing something good".
The greatest abyss in American journalistism is among those who run newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values while the value decreases to 23% at local level.
This has something to do with "security of work."
Leaders who think they're losing a job in three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving to 30%.
With regard to "security work" relating to staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still in the day-to-day order.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In such a vast nation as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet employers often offer what they want, and so they ask them to take or leave them.
Leaders receive nearly always huge wages and editors can make even ten thousand dollars a month off pension and insurance.
As far as permitted, the arguments are complex: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own knowledge, often get sick during one year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: SOUND IN THE SECTOR, DENMARK OF COPPOLA RECOVERY
The president of the second chamber of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse to introduce a businessman with the reality of Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale offer for Unipol-Bnl.
During the process of owning the cost, he received the release from a domestic prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a businessman and realitists change the place of stay from a rural town to the capital city.
However, according to the court, this transfer (compared to which the pm) would allow him to influence his society and get to the evidence that he is accused of.
Elites in Risk
This phenomenon was shown a few days ago when Komora's repressants voted against the rescue plan for providing 700 billion dollars to the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested and interested in Wall Street's punishment than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the recent New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is encircling the Republican party, constantly divided between its old soul East Coast, the milder, consistent with the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is rather conservative, hostile to the Washington world" and to the financial world, especially in the middle part and south.
A soul that has become arrogant by the vote I spoke about in the beginning.
This particular thing, however, is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown : not only in the United States but in the whole West and maybe not just here.
As in Usa, so in Europe it seems that this crisis has been acting as an incubator of phenomena that have been in Incubation for a long time, which have been stuck in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, exceptional recovery of the market, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which most of all budgets of people and families living in a single country are included.
Which simultaneously created a political problem for those who run it: that means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the world seems economically, but politically almost national.
Political internationality seems to be significantly outside the game or that has nothing to add: obvious proof has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies, and which cannot decide for one common political line.
And so everyone awaits the intervention of governments of each state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the allocation of funds: when we get into distress, only states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put things right.
And also owns the necessary means and authorisations to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances which no international organisation can ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis is putting on a state-national element, is, in fact, in total compliance with the increasing importance which is attempting to bring the last economic progress into line with one factor closely associated with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of Sita, increasingly sophisticated technologies, and mental, while we were convinced that global finances had already been predestined to rule the world, of nothing we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little non-material things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would have said that may be carried from one place to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a bordered area, territory.
So whoever happens to be their ruler, I'm sure he's got a lot more hands-on than who's not, and who has the bad luck of living in a place with no grain, no oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it's predicting a break.
Who speaks of territories, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it appears that two convergent phenomena are being formed.
On the one hand, knowing that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, an application for someone who can take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leadership, especially economics, which has proven to be equally incomparable and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feeling incompetence and absence, trying to control the entire ruling class in increasingly Western countries.
It seems to be growing in the vast masses of the population to believe that their actions are the same as the ideas of the present popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word, that the elite has already overrun its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The requirement for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political arrangement is manifested in the unexpected electoral groups" or in unexpected changes of collective moods in the last and most recent times, from a conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of the Labourers in the Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps with what to do with the victory in Italy).
We feel that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more and more problems to understand, i.e. represent, which, not since today, is formed in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-invigorating, growing, potentially too tight.
Before this, it would be excessive to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But I'm sure we can't say it means having your eyes open properly.
Super adhesive to climb walls
Convince the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of a variety of American research centres and now the team of four institutes has very close to it.
Scientists managed to maintain a stacked body glued to the vertical wall by a sticker of only 2.5 cm square meters.
STUDIUM – American magazine Science published the discoveries of some of the students of the University of Dayton, Akrona, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that invented the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use the specific carbon structure, which is called carbon midget tubes.
“We can imagine the foundation of adhesives as a series of pipes laid down as a arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired the feet of the gecko, covered by microscopic guys, which allow the animals to ensure a perfect click.
The tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time will simply reflect on the wall» explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Dayton University of Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps, to walk around the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating uses as a combination of electrical devices, because the midget carbon pipe is heat conductors and electricity.
Other applications could concern air space engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkley, California, focuses on research into new adhesives.
In one article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists presented glue formed from micro fibers as hair, which are clean from dust by movement to the surface to maintain the perfect attraction.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for the cocoa, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their eating changes in the intensity or reduction in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario in London to highlight the risks of juice both prepared and fresh in combination with the use of certain drugs, at the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia to cause new alarms: just one glass of grep, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to put the health of patients at risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing up to a toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
LYS IN RIZIKA– The Italian Medical Agency itself announced two years ago in the information bulletin, and it has deprived physicians and patients to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to give attention to what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NJEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that suppress drugs.
Long list of effects absorbed by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the challenge of Michele Carruby, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University in Milan:"This is usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that will arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So always read the illustrations of the medicines you get and if you run into something vague, do not be alarmed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» highlighted the expert for Ansa Agency.
Nobel for the economy of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenoan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of Bush administration.
A few months after the atents in September 2001, in the days of Enron, Krugman predicted in one comment given in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused him not to have a polemic, which for years was calculated, which however proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked, with what speed collapses as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the interests of the public, declared Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "econs of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of Bush's liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of issue Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source of personal production, which aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from public administration professionals, as a free alternative to a more known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows the general public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window, further, far more significant, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and to support the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
It is also placed on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document even with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some of the special features of some models as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for an example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
We can still create from this point of view documents of "PDF hybrids" which are similar to the typical Adobe format graphics and have the properties of the table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programmes: it is possible to work in Excel between different users and avoid conflicts in the changes, in the text program, one color is allocated to each co-workers to comment to make it more clear in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to transfer some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should convert the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openofice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version located on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the operating Linux system.
The installation cd may also be sent home or at the workplace upon request.
And if the topic of nullity can be the driving force for enlargement in households, the Open Office’s business area has a lot of bets, and it can already count on the various projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And neither does training offers, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a tabular processor that aims to replace Excel; exercise for presentation similar Powerpoint; Dbase, such as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal of 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and given that we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can be overrun.
Also the Kolah results are positive, it's the fourth Doping case.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is Rakušana Bernhard Kohla, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classed and winner of the top-of-the-line t-shirt.
The report quoted pages of the L'Equipe diary.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Ceru, Epo the third generation, after Italy Riccard Ricò and Leonard Piepol and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood samples of Kohl fall into those performed in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra labs.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity of the Ceru, Rakushan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohla at Epo third generation confirms the chief of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed of the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakushan placed himself in the step champions of the Spanish Carlos castr and the American Cadel Evansem, also acquired a punked shirt of the best height.
IMIGRANTI: IS IT ITALY A RASIST?
Italy "as the country of migrants only in the last house has turned into the priority objective of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
It transforms a beautiful country into a nation of racists, so it happens in one long article of New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case shows what the New York Times define as "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where they register "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-urban thinking in the country and the strongest support of North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to halt immigration and facilitate the eradication of illegal immigrants, is quoted as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
Tendence highlighted both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, he asked the state and the church to work together at the defeat of racism".
Students with victims of expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, unions for tenants, a single room can be rented by a student in Milan up to EUR 900, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such dimensions that all layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains the leading offices for Suniia, Laura Mariani – in this town a large demand by students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices, which has grown on residents as well."
In most cases, the supply of rents includes several misdemeanors: contracts in a free way, not registered, without limited rent, associated with subsidies.
Exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could regulate prices thanks to tax revision.
If we look at the details of research, we will see that in Milan, in Brianza, one bed is about 450 euros, the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) is paid for the single room over the middle value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 is needed for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, the central areas (San Lorenzo, the Piazza Bologna) want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
The values are slightly lower (€ 550 per single) in zones near other universities (Ostiens and Cinecità).
Save only if we move to peripheral areas: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, it takes EUR 300/450 for bed, for room from 400 to 600 EUR, with the highest prices in the Zones Policeline, Vomoro and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most frequent rental phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union is finally recorded one additional anomaly: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian.
Good-bye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city breaks the historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close for Multiplex.
"The town without the cinema is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers, as well as rural towns.
The process of reducing cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosalas in central urban zones is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a true cultural crime.
Often the historical places passed by memories," it's like we lost a friend, a friend we shared with a lot of ways and emotions", feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Torator Oscar 20 years ago and a great prize of jury in Cannes, who spoke the poetry of one village cinema and sorrow over the way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years the doors of 316 cinemas of traditional tip closed, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, by 5 in Palerm.
Among the regions most affected by lockdowns is first place Emilia-Romagna with a loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And evidence that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the introduction of a multiplex, are these three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 canvass more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian procedure has developed unracially» claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing survive because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not talk about the lack of funding for operators: the previous government debt is around EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million Euros per year would be needed to support the sector”.
Interesting is the bologan case, the first Italian city to worry about locks and which decided to find the east sign of the protoculus between the municipalities and Anec, the first such type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the standards planned are steps of tax relief for operators and advantages for the audience regarding mobility: audiences will be able to drive into a limited zone and will have special prices for stopping and at certain parks.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope the other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to build up against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adulthood, was a spark that convinced me to start a "New Paradiso Cinema", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been going through Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotions so that I don't have to look at the words blackened with dust, I turn to the other side.»
The link between politics and the mob group 'andrangheta, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor from Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the city council's election according to the interests of the mob group Piromalli".
The charges against the mob in Calabria against the mayor and vice-stars of Gioie Tauro Giorgio Da Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carla Martelli, arrested this morning for external cooperation with the mafia are heavy.
In the loins also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the nameist of the chief, already accused of committed crimes of the mafia, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense," writes state representatives, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay the opportunity to consult lawyer Piromalli.
"So the mob groups would allow – the judges – to officially enter the city authorities and to make it easier for them to control and manage public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission of Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underworld are many: "There are areas where the concentration of the mob is stronger than in others where the secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'Andranghettes, heroes who are still unscrupulous'.
Prisoners from this morning follow the arrest from July last year, which the police have shown that Piromalli's mob group got the final hit.
Since the end of April of last year, Gioii Tauro's city council has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for the connection between organised crime and local administration was also foreseen - the local politicians were removed from their functions in public administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrionionion, President of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of dissolution, the head of a coalition of the right centre after a narrow choice in May.
He screamed about the scandal when Prefectura ordered the settlement of the council.
He called for the responsibility of the Deputy Secretary of the Interior Marc Minniti and accused him that he had all been dreamt for political reasons, but the judges in the detention order signed this morning explained that the mob group had come so far that she asked for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations against the Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, "the willingness to move the claims of entrepreneurs, the representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and adapt the elections to the public administration of the Magi group's interests."
When energy is born out of waves, it enters the game with the greats.
It is an endless bed that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to discover a large global energy society.
The waves, the currents, the tides, the outflows are new sources of inexpensive energy, on which the sight of the colosses such as Chevron, which is now trying to draw hands on these resources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has been intensified.
When oil price fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside, but now environmental organisations and new oil price increases gave new impetus to the sector.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 declared that around 15 percent of world electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
this would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Plus, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
In 2005, Enersis agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this purpose was declared, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies – he has expressed himself to one of the spokesmen of a company connected to the U.S. oil colosses in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about how they can cooperate with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that it is on Alaska that the US is still enjoying oil and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc., from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested sums, even though they are not well known, show an increasing interest in observers.
Technology, krou needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the first place, because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
Meanwhile, the equipment in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not appear to cause large ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy generation, technologies with greater impact on the prosecution must be used.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fear that is connected to one another.
The force of the waves that move with the bits up and down is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure is turning the turbine, which provides energy to the generator.
Energy gets to the shore of submarine cables.
For the time being, there are four installations of this type at the project stage, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six sea turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the tide and flow causes the rotation of turbines, which by this rotating movement feed the generator.
Verdant expressed its view that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of flow and flow, they say in the Institute for Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, influx and outflows are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as the source of energy.
The new York, Maine and Alaska, and other coastal states, have already invested 7 and half million dollars in the energy of the tide and forecasting up to $35 million for 2009.
