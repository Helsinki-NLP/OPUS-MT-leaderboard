In an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend
During the distress line call, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and had to come home.
Lamb thought that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police, Amy Prentiss found a body and hand-written report on the white office paper, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said Lamb signed a letter by the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to school campus, where the police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
In the end, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, she forced students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, with responsible authority still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on both sides of the state and the students who knew him have jointly created an image of a talented but probably a problem teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record of a criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in thanking the great people with whom he shared his academic life.
They taught both at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with other 17 members of the Faculty and many students attended courses at both times.
At the same time, there were inclinicals with regard to problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shattered, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not give him an automatic term of office to become professor's assistant.
The president of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamba probably suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, the police picked up his trail when he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with one shot from a gun in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed the crown of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in the city, which accounts for some 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught countries and classes of education.
In spring he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-time friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met with one another.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who taught her how to play guitar for years.
It was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls is dead as soon as it has appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been dating for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of a wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house that was neighboring Gautier river shoulders.
The police said the dog was fine.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter who is now 19.
"She was completely broken," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She was best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail had been digging up at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random giants together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and an occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, sleeps the illuminated bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss at night on the 5th of September, the sweat that Lamb finished on the guitar and the harmony for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything bad.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We've been snooping and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a killed professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor at school.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of a boy's student club and student government.
At Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the Faculty, employees, students and members of the community, attended the reminders events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnidt was also involved in the vigilium, during which the university congregation succeeded "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, school started again.
"We are trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writings for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus, Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans have also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no proof that they were actually stolen.
Toys R Us is planning to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work out more hours.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 40,000 employees at business and distribution centres across the country, which is a decline compared to the 45 000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and the staff member will receive during October until December.
While holidays themselves are months away, the shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to take temporary staff to help in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his 'rande' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit there," he said in a trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie begins and I'm starting to realize that I'm at the heart of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and also director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian rapid military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" for the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only make the violence and suffering of millions of people worse.
Once again, the UN Head called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he was planning to meet foreign ministers five permanent country councils - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed his regret that division in the Council and among the Syrian people and the regional powers " had done this situation unresolved."
Ban invited five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and the unity they have shown in reaching Iran's nuclear agreement in the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes opinions.
Everybody else over their hands like they're over an invincible joke.
And some of them are preparing for the implosion.
But let some Republicans try to pull Donald Trumpa down from the top of the election, they can't do it (at the same time).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is a double number lead, and some people are seriously beginning to ask what it means for the nomination of this magnate from the real estate area.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
It's not saying that Trump is likely to win Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership took the lead to the rise of Herman Cain, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might be in general elections.
But an external group like Super PAC Jeba Bush and an economic conservative group of Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and begin interpreting their dollars on a standoff to throw it away.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the real estate magnate is not just a mixed phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, Monmouth University demonstrated that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the initial phases.
Following the vote of Quinnian University, which took place last week, 60 percent of Republicans were found to have a positive view on Trumpa.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the survey CNN/ORC, which took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans indicated that they would either be "excessed" or "rest" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 said they would be "breathed" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excessed" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim to be "unrested" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush was a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his incompetence and insult, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to think that real estate has the magnate right temperament for the President's post, according to the Monday vote of the ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Iowa Senate Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think he has a personality commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
However, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent people say that his temper is not in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put on their teaching hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
The question of who most likely will win the GOP nomination, four of 10 said that Trump would be the best option, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July when four of the 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Total publication: Voliči GOP did not have the brightest crystal in the past.
At this time in the previous cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a candidate against 28 percent for the final nomination of Mitto Romney.
Yet it appears that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as a credible one.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still hitting almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the decomposed field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership while anti-Trumpov’s support is difusionally spread between more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
She runs 13 points above Carly Fiorina, Marc Rubi 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie, 33 points to everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a businessman with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match against one.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made their opinion.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only half of Trumpa support voters claim not to change their opinion anymore.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door to change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent of his Outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in the announcement speech of his campaign with immigration still hold as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some are concerned that Trump’s influx is being taken away by key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and the damage to the rebranding effort.
But according to the new Monday public opinion survey ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the theme of immigration remains in the light of headlamps, Donald Trump will stay as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new maximum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of their support from the Republican voters, especially due to their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post claims they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa revealed several weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unrested" and 21 percent "fully angry."
The House supported a larger proportion of the country's coal charges.
The Czech Republic will gain over 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government amendment of the Upper Act, which regulates the amount of payment from the mining companies of brown coal.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that they would receive extra money both the Treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
In the first reading, opposition Members who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipality as they have been, since they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which, in addition, means that the State should receive a greater part of the proceeds from the proceeds of top-down brown coal mining from mining companies.
The share of the State will increase to 67 percent, while the share of the municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The forecast also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that companies produce.
Change in mineral mining charges is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million to the Treasury in 2013.
The revenue of the municipality's budgets is to have a neutral impact according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipality gained about CZK 450 million and a government budget of CZK 150 million.
Out of brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns went to the municipalities.
The amendment also calculates an increase in the payment from the time-limits with the mining allowed per 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) said that the municipality would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by the law, but the government will set it up in its own regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of the recovered mineral and the rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is a reason, among other things, to change.
Mr ODS Marek Benda, however, warned that the setting of a fee by the government may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, it is not in this case a tax because the State charges a mineral which is a state property.
Fees shall be received only by the municipalities whose territories are subject to mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, they get three quarters of foreign money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive mining.
Part of the money to be paid on mining charges will be paid for purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repairing damage to the mining industry or to provide a baňa rescue service.
In particular, opposition Members criticised that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and by countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipality as they did so before because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions simply to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústecký Region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Moscow, KSČM Hana Aulická warned Member.
Kadner and Aulická have successfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
The reason for this is that, according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will increase compensation for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is burdensome.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is used for limits, then it will have impact on both the state and the municipality's incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovakian army should fall after 2020.
In his view, the limits below the ČSA should be break over for social, economic and national reasons for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
The happy will lead Czechs as one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tenis appear at the Thursday draw of Davis's Cup in India on the table, and this time each one will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil is planning that given the difficult conditions, he will decompose the load on the entire quartet.
There are hot and high humidity in Delhi, so there are demanding matches that can stretch to five hundred.
We have to take this into consideration.
I'd like to spread the weather.
And according to the way it will look, Navrátil said during today's Czech selection training in the centre, glad that Kumara Khana.
With one team and a world 40, Jiří Happy counts in Friday and Sunday two games.
At the position of the two, most likely, is Luke Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like almost everyone involved.
It's a little bit in my head, but I'm not gonna tell you yet, the captain said.
Another security in the Czech assembly should be Štěpánkov's participation in Saturday's four-game.
It's just the question of who's going to stand next to the experienced deblist, who's got a cup in Davis's quadruple 18:4.
It's probably not gonna be happy.
There are still options with Rosal or Adam Pavlásek.
"I don't really know who and how it's gonna look," Navrátil said.
It will decide according to the development of two games.
Pavlásek, with her surprises in the 1st round of the prize in the floor over the Australians, may be a warner.
He said, "He is good in the double," Navrátil said.
I've done it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The house will put Yuki Bhambri (125th ATP), who won the Challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat the players third and fourth hundred ladders.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both players from the challengers and ours have experience with the ATP Tour, but we've learned a lot of times that the ladders in the Davis Cup don't decide.
"It decides the current form, the weather," Navrátil said.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 SELČ and can stretch for the weather.
According to the prediction, it's supposed to rain and the jacket isn't under the roof.
However, it may be used as an artificial lighting.
They've already lighted it, and it's got about 2,000 luxury, which is enough.
"It should be achieved under lights," Navrátil said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
From his choice, the debut of Mr. Corbyn in PMQ has been very excitedly expected
Jeremy Corbyn's new work manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and he'll be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will put forward the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In a weekly statement he asked for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip some of the sessions he would leave behind his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's management, which comes after his appointment to the shadow booth and his Tuesday speeches to the annual TUC Congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labourian leader to stand silent during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle for Britain met with criticism from a series of conservative Members and is the center of attention of several stories on the front page of the newspaper.
The decision of Mr Corbyn not to sing a national anthem drew attention to himself
Speaker Corbyn said he would stand in honorable silence and recognize "the heroship of royal air force in the battle for Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabin, Owen Smith, communicated the BBC Two's Newsnight program that the Labour Leader would recommend the National Anthem to sing "without reference" to his belief that the monarchy should be lifted.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top of Mr. Corbyn's team, quote differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "rathering" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn over his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Working Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clear" was engulfing government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23.000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Mining Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade of his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the worker party who has promised a different approach to politics claims he has ideas of "from crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confronted and that it will stay both "fitting answers" and "inclusive trade," and instead promises it to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secrets, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let the other colleagues get off to him from time to time because he had heard that he had discussed the whole matter with the spokesmen of John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn away from the style of "Punch and Judy", which was often associated with PMQ, but he admitted several years later that he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer for the judgment of leaders, their management of the House and their position between other MPs, although critics argued that they became a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
"Fonce in Jobburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Johannesburg Center is a tough place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photographs of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The following data came up and showed recovery of the British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above by means of the SABMiller tender target.
Between May and June, GB’s profits, including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to last year’s same period.
This was quickly since 2009, and it seemed as if the estimates were close to when the rates would rise.
Sterling increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3330.
FTSE 100 index closed for 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped 20% after he got close to offering from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the biggest breweries in the world, and close-up marks such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares were 0.9% higher in encouraging reports from the rival group of luxury products Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fall on the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the company's "sale."
JD Sports went up by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in mid-years before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it's unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed its higher wage costs, reports.
Costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean less jobs.
The opponents of Prague apartment marsmelon are excavating.
Controversial construction's got a lead.
The investor of Prague Progetti e Investmenti considers the abolition of the decision to be unlawful and to appeal against it.
Against the construction to be built in close proximity to the Anesian monastery in the centre of Prague, 1 hundred people protested before the Prague office, petitions were created.
The Magistrate in the decision stated that there was a breach of the building law because all the elements of the territorial decision were not respected.
"For instance, the over-the-counter territorial decision does not contain, for example, the type of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear and understandablely described shape of the building, the demarcation of the territory concerned by the influence of the construction," says the decision.
It also considers that some of the documents for the decision were issued to the original dossier, which had changed.
This is, for example, an opinion by the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its approval.
It follows from the file material that, however, the land owner has only given consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not to the location of the building on his premises, writes the Department of Construction Orders.
According to Francesca Augusta Razatta, the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we follow all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razeetto said in the press release.
The project, which people, due to the alleged colour of the facade, are looking for marsmelon in Prague for strong emotions.
In the city center, hundreds of people have been protested in the past.
The association and people close to home are concerned that some of the permits were issued for a house that should have looked different many years ago.
They also criticise the integrity of buildings for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anežské monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted with the famous façade, refused, on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPO), the Ministry of Culture, and cancelled the authorisation of Prague Memorials in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investments with facial-shaped windows, but also NPÚ and magistrate monuments have been approved and on this basis a building permit has been issued.
The author rejects the exception of opponents, he said he never counted on the façade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname to pink and white diabetes.
The Czech politician took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way he took along the crew to the car three Syrian refugees, who said they wanted to take about half a mile.
At that time, he thought it was not criminal in Hungary, he claimed it to the People's newspapers.
We knew that the guardians of the law did not reach such an agreement.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us for our surprise, and moved us to Shegeda for investigation, described a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in his politics.
The cops said they were acting right, but the communication was, because they couldn't do too well in English.
However, his prison felt it was tragic.
For example, about three times four meters in our target were loaded with 15 refugees from Syria.
There were two-year-old boys or four-year-old girls among them.
These people were closed there the second day, and none of them knew what to do with them because of the language barrier, said Berg.

Metcash starts the campaign in the country to fight Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's infancy in southern and western Australia.
Metcash starts the campaign in the country to fight Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are added brands such as Dunsborough based on Simmo's ice creamer offering taste in IGA shops and owners of shops sell discount tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defensive strategy on the 29th of September, when the dealer of food, alcohol and hardware celebrates his annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA trades use much stronger market share than in NSW, Viktoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will rely on 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first trades that took over from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose $ 360 million on annual sales and Metcash 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on each market.
Loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost him about 13 million dollars on pre-tax revenues, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the Eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the last survey of Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the food sales of Metcash will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglas Fund, the founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "very probably disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that the board member of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18% to 14 percent since 2010 and the earnings from the food trade Metcash, which supply around 1200 IGA retail stores, fell by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational developments of speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale went into counter-attacks and invest more than USD 150 million per year to match the counter prices in Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week and thus helps IGA retailes refurbished stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private clients.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morris, claims that the price matching programs and the handling of shops will be caught by salvation and hopes that large sales will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanas Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Stevem Healy
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his conduct.
Thanas Kokkinakis has become a close loss in a recent struggle around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duea often called "Special Ks," drew attention to himself by means of an unwelcome affair with an unfamiliar Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinko on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by a referee, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka had one to draw Kyrgios and I should have drawn him up."
While he was last seen breaking down a rocket after he was convulsed by the possibility of getting Richard Gasquet into the US Open, Kokkinakis was invinciblely defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for the second-game location for Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thansi was a bit attached to the whole dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed a rocket when he lost because of a convulsions in the US, but he's not the first player to take the rage out of himself because of frustration on his rocket.
But he was really well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a great deal of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's also got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, works very hard and falls on the team great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the closet, he's working hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and advanced young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to miss Kyrgios due to an important match that starts on Friday, and states that "serious decisions" is the right solution for all, but supports the parent from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term permanentist.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all of the controversy that was built around it [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think that Nick went up very quickly, as Feder, Murray and other people point out, he's growing up in public quickly, he also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time beyond the credit when he can think about it, is the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European Migrating Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closing borders and arresting migrants
After notification of the state of threat to Hungary on Tuesday, it closed its southern border with Serbia and arrested those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country no one and Serbian authorities reacted in a violent way.
Those who have been stuck on the ground between the two states who are fleeing violence in their home countries are building up states and dwelling.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When helicopters cross over them, migrants call together "Open the Borders!" and they give order to Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water at the protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "uninvited" to allow refugees to be sent back from Hungary while more and more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state block failed to come up with a uniform immigration policy for ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and to speak with the hope of reaching a possible agreement for another month or the end of the year, which the EU nations would adopt more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria for Tuesday called on the EU's special summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
The Tuesday state of threat in two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up judicial cases for asylum.
In the meantime, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence from a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed at the Serbian border.
CBS News Korean Charlie D ́Agatha reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of which have escaped from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, which is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of the 4 metre fence, which the government has placed at the southern border with Serbia, and also lays down longer prison periods for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of threat," said the reporters of the Government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Sheged.
In this we are very clear: illegal crossing of borders is crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press at the border observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's consultant for Home Defence, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 already caught on the territory of the state.
They have suffered damage to the fence and are now in police custody charged with the execution of offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly got the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing in Roszek, chaos was created because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and the pressures of people were created.
About 20 of them walked in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they rejected food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: The Naskok Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders decreased by half in the national vote
The former foreign minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-point lead at the Democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (lower from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (recent of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, has been receiving support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the opening of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more confident about their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton's soil under her feet has been lost in several demographic groups while Sanders has acquired several.
Clinton keeps a big lead between women and eases, but her leadership narrows down.
Her support between men fell significantly, and Sanders loses only five points on her.
The benefit of Clinton and the democratic voters under 50 has disappeared and are now equal to Sanders.
Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-point lead in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders loses only five points on her in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in the whole states say she'd be excited to support Clinton if she were to become the candidate of the party.
Fourthly, she would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her only for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't suppose it's a surprise they're the current supporters of Clinton because of her particularly inflamedness.
The views are mixed among those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would be thrilled to support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would be thrilled to support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When the supporters of Clinton are asked in an open question, why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), she follows that it is time for her to be the president of the woman (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
The supporters of Clinton also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, there is a great opportunity to choose and agree on problems.
While the vice president is considering potential running for the President, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would want him to face - a third of them think he shouldn't run.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second option for the nomination of the parties, the most common choice is Aiden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden said as their second option, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, at 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is a very second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely selectable is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer solving problems over the greater chances of choosing.
Like last month, neither one democratic candidate or potential candidate shall act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary voters of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and credible and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don't think Clinton's honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion on him.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as state secrets continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that it did not affect their overall view at all.
But it's a different story between the American public.
Half the Americans are now disgruntled with its explanation, while only about a third of them are satisfied.
The public views on this topic have been divided into March, shortly after this problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, whereas 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton worsened.
This is mainly the Republicans, where more than 6 of 10 claim that their opinion on Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is perceived to be honest and credible among her voters, this question is still a problem between registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, which is a decline of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think it's honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trumpa as honest and credible.
However, Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush bested.
Sanders sees more than honest people, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't think about him.
The error rate for sample 351 of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey and the others are getting their support.
The voters from across the country continue to support Trumpa with a vast majority, reaching 23% of the support in the last CBS survey before the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The research also found out that Carson is leading through demographic groups, and he's cutting Trumpa between universities educated by Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of Ohio John Kasich, is behind the visconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the oasis with 10% of the support fell to the present 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The loss of sample 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of the aid between the Republics of Trump 32% of the aid.
The latest survey from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
During Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon in the field, and even apologize to Carson for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity were accused of the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the predominant brother ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murder against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Denga during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and the delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced the police.
The police say he had his eyes tied up, had a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
In the end, Mr. Deng complained about headaches and then fell into unconsciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before the police took him to the hospital.
However, they found time to change Dengova's dress, look out his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him on the board, said police chief Chris Vagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their equipment and basically preferred the welfare of brotherhood before the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object to the head, body and thigh.
"For many families have been demolished as a result of overloading in fraternity and at least one student dies every year due to overloading since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengov's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the institutions.
The great jury Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assaulting overtrust and crime.
"We want to hold not only the parties involved, but if there is an organisation that approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will also lead them to responsibility," Wagner said at the conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternism and national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The growth of the rates will come and the bull market will stumble, bond returns will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, specifically offers the history of a small producer of timing.
Recess came after 11 months after the first tariff increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve to raise rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central banks officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases are starting, but rather on trajectory how long normalization will take.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, members of the market can make sure that all the fuss due to an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis has been inevitably interpreted as the end of the 'low money' era," said Julian Jessop, the leading global economist of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how certain areas of economies will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen for the last approx. a month, the expected increase in the rates can make the air slightly unstable.
But once an increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for reintroduction of shares 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect again the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analysts in a recent study on what would happen after the rise of the Fed.
More specifically, the market over the last 35 years often most - about 14 percent - is heading towards an increase in the rates in relatively flat in 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 percent), and then again returns to normal state after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main stock loss of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the stock impact has a tendency to become more significant later in the rate-up cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recess is a real economic life, but higher rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that a rough domestic product near its lowest point in history when increasing the rates of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, only two nominal annual increases in GDP have been below 4.5 percent during 118 rates since 1950.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few would expect to hold it, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in tariffs in this difficult economic background could be risky and the question would appear, "this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow Feda all year round, and all the eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee that took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all of the increasing cycles have been in the super cycle of the increase in the puck effect with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far the longest of those waiting for Fed from the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we continue.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects to increase its rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster visible to bonds than to shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
Bonds appear to have changed the direction immediately after the first entry of the growth/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yield increases fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's Strategists believe that the increase in the rates will cause the accruals between long- and short-datad bonds to rise, which is equal to the curve.
Dłuhopis with high yield often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about the charging of income," she stated in her analysis Kathy Jones, a firm analyst of the fixed pension in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are already adapted by Fed's expectations.
"There are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is more crowded, the credit margin has spread and the volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens the policy.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win the interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
A multinational society with a lot of debt will be able to do worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"Historie shows that "quality" of shares tends to be overcome within three months of the initial increase in the rate," the analysts of Goldman Sachsve reported in the client report.
Companies with strong balances ahead of weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital yields, as well as low volatility stocks, also exceeded their lower quality counterparts by 4 (percent points), and 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
In addition to pure stock play, consumers also benefit from a rising dollar.
Experts can see their profits also through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "deeping"
It takes the view that it is becoming increasingly unrecognizable from its commercial rival
He's also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
Member of Damien Collins assaulted the Voice and says neither is he an original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "change" in Classic FM, claiming the leading Members and gathering fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service radio station seemed to be "globalized" and is increasingly undetectable from his rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "globalized" - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that think of me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The CEO of the BBC rejected the accusation on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its trade opponent as regards live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and making music is really on top of it.
"So I think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Regulator Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated with regard to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire due to the footing of its competitors during the broadcast of culture, Media and Sport and they reached the hearing of the Commission.
The Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unofficial and in no way different?
Lord Hall insisted that show BBC1 - in which Paloma Faith and Boy George star shines as judges - was made "the custom typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted Korporace "to find a hit from her own stables" when she started the next fun series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of more future series of The Voices or the payment of money to license fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grow at the slowest pace since August and the blame can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since 2000 started with records
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for stopping the loss
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise and it made many British major streets become a city of ghosts.
However, experts argue that there are signs of stopping online sales, and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total August expenditure represented the lowest increase in growth since the early 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of stopping online sales and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always rationalized," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, an IMR index editor.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones for making purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in various contexts such as couches.
But now (growing) is a little stagnant, which is why it seems to disappear.
The Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers can refrain from buying before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the shoppers' average turned to their computers to arrange purchases and to cancel several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which the buyers are renegotiating, can hold customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was lost online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales is carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, a place to buy in stone stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the family of Bin Laden was punished
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred through Muslim streets in the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly casts blame for the collapse of the design magata Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain degree in white, the mourner chose the way and gave up their respect for the sacrifice, when the first of the fallen came on his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moas.
A sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane passed through the ceiling of the mossies and fell into the believers.
The body was released for funerals and the Saudi king was punishing the building group of the family bin Laden over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the launch of the annual serpent.
Saudi officials have already promised that the serpent would take place in Mecca, and thousands of people would continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group wasn't supposed to leave the crane shoulder up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the State operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English media agency service did not report this detail, but stated that foreign travel was prohibited from the bosses of the company.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are recovering before the Haj's pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statements on the crane collapse and were not given any comments by its representatives.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with weather officials.
Descends of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort in the head with Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades and has been running large construction projects.
The late leader of the Al-Qaida Usama bin Laden was the son of apostate whom the family broke down in the 1990s.
Havárie became in the middle of a strong wind and rain only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a bond that must at least once in life take part in every successful Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million rivals (£ 174.000) would be devoted to relatives killed and the same amount for permanently injured.

Chief B&Q claims Eastern Europe's traders working cheap already on a trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronica Laura.
The number of Eastern Europe businessmen taught is behind the point of growth
The result is open to 200 Screwfix stores aimed at traders.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
He worked on Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are saying that they put off hammers and brushs and hand them over to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a painter brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are getting more and more busy with craftsmen in order to do the best work at their home, according to Srewfix B&Q's bosses.
Veronica Laura, new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for home needs, claims that a large increase in the number of Eastern Europe businessmen offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 other Screwfix stores aimed at dealers, closing 60 B&Q outletes.
Mrs. Laura says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better half of them.
At present, most male workers are male.
She said that there is a need to address an increasing demographic trend that shows more women's households who make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "The stables in our stores work mostly by men.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laura, who is one of only five women in the company managers' corms according to the British FTSE100 Index, has also redesigned her top team to reflect the equivalence between the managers of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that he has half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial director.
Mrs Laura says, "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we would have taken to us.
Kingfisher reported a fall both in profit in mid-year and in sales after the group took the cost of closing shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Srewfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The EUR 600 contribution to the pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
President Zbynek Stanjura noted that although the one-time contribution was good, it would have been better for him to be in standard valorization for a long time, as he would also have been in further years.
"We have space to find a mechanism as to what we will do," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michael Marks (ČSSD), according to which he was to be approved over the framework of the law next year.
Marks argued that she would improve the social situation of pensioners who, according to her, are not pink.
According to her, the budgetary impact of 5,5 billion crowns would mean higher valorization next year, and the ministers debate every stamilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past the rate of valorization decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Oálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not resolve the real pension reduction in 2016 and later.
In this right-hand pay in December, he's significantly rooting and perhaps also contaminate, he said.
The president of ČSSD Members, Roman Sklenák, therefore, proposed a shortening of the deadline for the discussion of standards in committee for 10 or 20 days, blocked this right.
But the committee will have a month's place for the usual two.
Bonus should be worth a total of 1,73 billion crowns.
The money is mainly to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should grow on average by about a hundred.
The contribution should be made to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of the pension in December.
Those who have ceased their pension rights in December may receive it before it has been paid.
However, they would have to ask for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly measured for January, namely price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, which should be 40.5 percent next year.
Last year, the state spent CZK 314,7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion more year-olds.
Expenses for old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full retirement last year increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714 in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full of old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 of an average pension.
Jakunin has left plans for a political career, he'll be dealing with science.
The Senate chair, according to the Russian media, was almost certain.
In the Council, the Federation was to represent the western Kaliningrad Region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the government of the United Russia, defended his post in Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators do not allow citizens, but they are chosen by the governor of the three candidates whose names will be announced before the Governorial elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose.
It was complicated for Jakun's that he did not live in the Kaliningrad area for twenty years, as required by the law.
Although Kremlin found an exception for Jakunina, he is an extraordinary and powerful ambassador, not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.

Bajgar wanted to catch a type of relationship in which one of his partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role of Bartošk, with whom he had already worked on the Invisibility series.
Yet, he was told by an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break linked to the convalescence after a serious illness.
We agreed three years ago.
I gave him a script reading, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he was probably a cursed athlete.
He used to always ask where he was going to sit before the next scene was shot.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks and even going uphill.
And that's all in record tropical heat, said the director.
According to Bartok, women are taking a tiger to make a rabbit out of him in time.
They're gonna put some food on him, but they're gonna close the door so he can't happen to play a tiger outside of the rabbit.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, comment on the actor.

Azerbaijan canceled part of the visit to Telicik for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement Pavel Telička postponed the Thursday trip to Baku because the Caribbean authorities today cancelled the official part of the visit.
According to Telka, this is why the EP resolution from last week, which criticises the violations of human rights in Azerbaijan and of Telička as co-author.
By the decision of the Iranian party Telička lost the possibility of interviews with the official partners as well as of visiting political prisoners, depending on the agreement of the authorities, she explained in the press release of his Brussels office.
The trip that was planned several months earlier, Telička wanted to use to meet Parliament's leadership and representatives of the executive and the representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, explained the text sent by the Czech Republic.
The EP resolution condemns "unforeseeable repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She invited European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officers and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment of the Iranian opposition journalist Chad Ismail, who applied for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out a Russian air base in Syria when visiting Novosi Booth.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has already used the sea base in Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics centre in Syria.
According to the Russian press reports, supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria has increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to set up a air base near Latakía, which, for the time being, remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Washington, however, has no specific military intentions of Russia in Syria to be very clear, American commentators are congruent.
U.S. Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with the Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov, it has already been their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah goes to Moscow to interpret his concern for the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesperson Josh Earnest identified Assad's support from Moscow as a lost bet.
Russia’s policy objectives in Syria have said that they are rather unclear.
Moscow according to him, she made her satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is watching a long-term goal, but what Enerist believes is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation of Russian press.
On the contrary, the Russian leader said that it was an accident to speak about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to today's report, The New York Times does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian President could meet during the UN meeting.
The ideas between the White House advisers have yet to spread.
Today, the TASS Agency, referring to the words of the Crimean spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the program of her New York stay.
Place the sesame oil in the gallbladder diet, hemp helping to strengthen immunity.
The use of extra virgin oils is a good way to increase the intake of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits.
When pressing seeds for cold, they will remain in the oil of all healthy substances.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
These are, according to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the most common reason for the death of the Czechs for several years.
The gallbladder inflammation suffers mainly from women, helps sesame oil.
If you are part of Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss sesame oil in your sleep, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it is also possible to use in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of favourable health effects.
It is often used in gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are with 90% cause of gallbladder inflammation and women with these difficulties suffer 3 times more often than men.
In general, the problems with gallbladder are related in particular to people with overweight who do not export and consume a lot of animal fats.
The sesame oil can be used with success even in a liver diet that is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits it brings to the consumption of this oil, they should be careful about the goods from exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use overwhelmed seeds for pressing, which have a greater taste.
Oil thus loses all active substances, described by Ladislav Kětecký, executive director from Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oils pressed for cold.
The company now also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively uncircumcised white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our fox can dial eight kilos of sesame.
The raw material shall be warmed up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin marking.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil helps in heart disease and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among the oil is sunny.
From the research of Jarmila Hamerska, which led to Masaryk University, it appeared to be preferable in a warm kitchen of 43% of respondents.
However, it is not really appropriate to fry, at 180 °C, it begins to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, for the flavoring of salads and especially fit in a diet that helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids which most reduce cholesterol from all fatty acids.
The amount of total fat and calories taken must be taken care of in heart problems.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the spoon of rape oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch after extra virgin oils.
The sunflower can last as much as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
The storage in the fridge will be extended even further.
The old oil people will know according to the bitter taste in particular.
On the contrary, there's no rocking at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Casual oil contains the most healthy acids.
The technical seed of hemp shall be classified with the so-called superfoods and therefore hemp oil shall be considered as the most healthy of vegetable oils.
This indication owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids can't make the body by itself, and you have to take it from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European magazine showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece are conceding it with 0.6 grams, on the contrary, the Icelandics will take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Casual oil should be included in the diet as part of the supportive diet to strengthen immunity and to heal injury.
It has anti-septic effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using a hemp oil, they don't have any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that it belongs to the most sold in Bohemia Oil.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon just in the morning.
Konopný oil is not tastefully significant, but perfectly strengthens immunity, was advised by Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil's karst company.
According to statistics, Americans are the most attractive nation of barbecues.
There are 1.4 barbecues on one household.
There are various grilling competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs outside.
On the basis of consumer surveys in the Czech market, we find that 4% of people have not sinned.
The vast majority then grilles even a few times a year.
In order to be successful grilling, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable and, at the same time, leaves good health for beneficial substances when grilling?
Generally, fat should be saved during the grilling process itself.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then lose the body of the beneficial substances which otherwise we obtain from the consumption of food oils which are treated at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't find their use in grilling.
Horrible oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately extract grape oil.
It is wonderfully added to the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen has a unique quality of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high level of combustion up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils retain the health of the beneficial substances, Daniel Vlček describes the benefits of grape oil from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to several Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that the grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting cholesterol surpluses.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help increase our external beauty by combining grape oil - improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acidic and helps to care for dry and broken hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, such as salad flavoring, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, you can use two different ways in grilling and grilling yourself.
We'll keep their juice by completing our meat and fish.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, acidity will be given with apple vinegar and thus soft meat.
The mating adds meat to taste and oil preserves and adds the right cut, advises Daniel Wolf.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
Marined meat or fish are prepared to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by just a few drops to prepare food.
The same applies to barbecues.
Some oils are total taboo for this way.
This is especially related to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Shake oil with oil before grilling yourself, prevents you from burning food.
The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of barbecue.
For grilled meat and fish, practically anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the salad Hot Summer.
To which you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bag of rubles • 1 cup of sliced cucumbers • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl to the mixture of salad leaves torn to the sleeve, sliced cucumbers and large cubes cut with peaches.
According to the taste, salt and opiate, you can also taste the milky chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, put on a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste then you can soak the salad with fine slices.
Multiple Sclerosis: It doesn't matter only for medication, but also for the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and one with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, such as women with multiple sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, social advice, etc. is part of social advice.
However, this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient itself.
The more he fights disease actively, the longer he can work and he doesn't have to substantially change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick relaxes the area for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is demonstrated that regular movement considerably separates the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a stick.
It is important for patients and their surroundings not to be subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That's why there's a website Take a chance (www.freedom.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaigns Take a chance.
The most important person in the care of a disease with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, twice the recommendation that the disease will start to heal sooner is more likely to affect your doctor.
It's because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stages where neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we reach, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of lower limbs or imbalances of balance.
The patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain the condition, to improve walking, to strengthen the courtbed, to reduce swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the particular patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, Mayor of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but they show themselves in a different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve her symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that sick people verify what they can do and that strengthens their self-assurance.
"He also has endorphins and he feels good for him," says PhDr. Kamila Šas from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Faculty of Royal Vinohrada.
By affecting the physical side, we influence the lymph system responsible for emotions.
This directly interferes with the mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, adds.
"We know today that these patients have been so closely spared," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, who prefers the Clinics of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The objective of physiotherapy is that one can stay as long as possible, including working assignment.
Therefore, the Physiotherapy co-operates with ergotherapeuts to get compensation aid made to him at peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you find a serious illness in your life, most people will shake it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With this painful soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own.
"I work with them so that eventually they conclude that even handicap can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says the psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer, Latecoere would not fly airbuses.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technology.
New planes are filled with titanium or light and solid composition materials that can't be produced and processed right away.
Still, it is possible next to the super-extensive, computer-controlled machine tools, beside the autoclaves to shape compositions, to attack something as common as merruňské pesky.
In a drum that reminds a pot of sugar watt, the edges of the metal parts that just came out of the milling machine are mixed in a pile of furnaces.
"Also no one better came," smiles Ivan Dubský, general director of Latecoere Czech air door manufacturer.
In the complex in Prague Letňane, the former Lettov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Doors, which are part of Prague, also enter first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the largest transport aircraft in the world Airbus A380.
There's a door full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Like the moment keys, the company's gonna have to get it together twice a year.
If there is no record of control on the yellow stickers, there should be something to explain to Airbus auditors or Boeing who run regularly to see if the door is produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses, however, have not yet completely replaced advanced technology.
On one door to A320 there's 1500 rivets.
They've got to hand-knit the nymphs.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of the hammer, they'll know if it's broken right now.
The tolerance they're moving in is minimal.
The blade can be above the plane surface from zero to 0.13 millimeter.
That's about twice the thickness of the human hair.
At the check, there'll be a series of trained performances.
When the controller goes through a series of rivets, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.
When he takes the exact gauge into his hand.
Lettov operated the L-39 training program prior to 1989.
But in 1991, neither of them produced any more.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
That's when she got together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a call for an emergency door supplier for model A321.
The Boeing deals weren't so happy.
"We were a small company for them that didn't have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee a long-term stable supply," he recalls Dubský.
Doors to the U.S. producer would remain knocked up if Letov did not take part in the Prague conference of the International Air Industry Group of the French Latecoere in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day there was a meeting with the French, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
Immediately in 2000 the assembly of parts of the door for A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors came for A380.
In 2006, the company built a new warehouse for the processing of compositions for the delivery of Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have been able to access these great orders ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want a supply guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification of 170 special manufacturing processes and qualifications for key staff.
Without them, the company wouldn't make any doors to the aircraft.
Obtain certificates that the manufacturing processes meet customer requirements and keep them worth millions of crowns in repeated checks.
Production processes are changing every year.
They're more accurate and tougher.
We need to train staff, get the equipment and re-certify the process, supply Dubský.
Now, the company completes the preparation of the process for the metaling of zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they were awarded by the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technologies for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The Boeing people will come, check out the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples test themselves in their lab, and then the results compare with ours, brings closer the Dubian way the customers control them.
The rewards are Prague’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race stands today and the embryo production falls off.
For A320 produces half of the total volume of the door.
The replacement of the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for the Brazilian or European manufacturer.
It does not mean, however, that he could say any price behind the door.
A price curve is part of the contract.
This indicates how many doors will stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price for a piece is still dropping to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we're going to do business, he says Dubsky.
Half the halls, where electric closets are compiled for military aircraft Airbus A400 M, are still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line is built behind the curtain for the innovative model A320 Neo.
The non-referencing is speeding up and over-extinguishing.
"This is the trend of installation in aviation," the Dubský adds.
The rest has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Only a few metres away will the line be created for complete assembly of the door for upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests for the installation of certain electrical and electronic door equipment for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets on further development of production from composition materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company it is a huge credit when he can process compositions besides metal materials," says Dubský.
Latecoe, however, is reached at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in Letov.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
He's 800 now, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordering each year, they don't have to worry about working.
Although he has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Latecoere faced a threat to bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for a bright loan payment.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach out to the main creditors.
At the end of August, a portion of the loan replaced them as shares.
The creditors gained EUR 57.4 million by capital increase in the company.
The debt of the company decreased by two thirds, which is EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has signed new shares among existing shareholders for EUR 222.9 million.
In total, she raised the capital of EUR 280 million.
The whole group is benefiting from the rising production of Airbus and Boeing, which participate in the marketplace of 85 percent.
The average increase in contracts is expected by four percent annually until 2017.
In the contract book, he has 2.6 billion orders, corresponding to four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on the hoods.
The Czech competition in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
The Group accounts for 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a larger proportion of the country's coal charges.
Change in mineral mining charges is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million to the Treasury in 2013.
The revenue of the municipality's budgets is to have a neutral impact according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipality gained about CZK 450 million and a government budget of CZK 150 million.
Out of brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns went to the municipalities.
The amendment also calculates an increase in the payment from the time-limits with the mining allowed per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) said that the municipality would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by the law, but the government will set it up in its own regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of the recovered mineral and the rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is a reason, among other things, to change.
Mr ODS Marek Benda, however, warned that the setting of a fee by the government may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, it is not in this case a tax because the State charges a mineral which is a state property.
Fees shall be received only by the municipalities whose territories are subject to mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, they get three quarters of foreign money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive mining.
Part of the money to be paid on mining charges will be paid for purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repairing damage to the mining industry or to provide a baňa rescue service.
The opposition Members today criticised those who claimed, in particular, that they would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipality as they did so before because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions simply to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústecký Region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Moscow, KSČM Hana Aulická warned Member.
Kadner and Aulická have successfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
The reason for this is that, according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will increase compensation for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is burdensome.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is used for limits, then it will have impact on both the state and the municipality's incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovakian army should fall after 2020.
In his view, the limits below the ČSA should be break over for social, economic and national reasons for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for decisions on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve is going to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
The 80 economists addressed by the Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision are now thinking that they will remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates between 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event, because it's taken years since the Feds dropped the rates.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the Central Bank could be able to get out of zero counter and start a process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, Head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy was relatively well, recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on that day he wrote a note in which he claims to be “a lot” of his first murders and that he wishes to take it back, revealed in Tuesday government offices.
The police at Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, the teacher of the Lépis and social science at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 p.m.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb's dispatch asked to send cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there is a "cut dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone," but is upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb didn't explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found a body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and hand-written message from Lamba, which said: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person that ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The Dean of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “in the head of Mr. Lamb there was obviously something going on.”
Despite the Monday statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt the government said that there was no "no evidence" about the "loved triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "cold" in the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, worked Prentiss from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, was dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the forest where he shot himself.
According to the journal published on the school website, Lamb obtained a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars that have lost their magic
The actor (on the left), has a few stressful years of view with his son Redmond.
In 2001 he fought with leukémia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was detained for drug possession.
I'm sure all these things are taxing themselves.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during the Manchester United defeat in Lize Masters versus PSV Eindhoven.
While this left this left-handed defender tearing this wound out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused Hector Morena's carefree procedure in 15 minutes when Shaw passed into PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes, and oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of his legs, and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transported tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years it's got a very tough time, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing rooms, he also had an oxygen mask attached.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested the Italian referee was wrong.
You can assess whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their news, in words you can't express how destroyed I am, my path to recovery starts now and I'll be back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injuries in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coc, coach of PSF, said, "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the playground with this kind of injury, everyone's very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt our opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at World Cup 2014.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Coc said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I only saw a ball that was headed a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see a procedure for Luke.
In an interview for SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long for her to learn to get tired of it.
Of course you can't be David Cameron.
On the question of the child scheme provider to name the favorite child book, he chose the Prime Minister Lorax, a fairy tale from Dr. Seusse of 1971.
It was difficult to choose from, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and goes on: "A funny, touching, creative, and strong content, such as I liked to read to my children, because behind it was always a picture or message I had never seen."
All right, except in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the lift from the film of 2012, which added other characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to receive the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text added by Cameron reads as a summary elevator of Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and starts by saying, "In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to receive the heart of a girl of her dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the history of a book where the nameless young man will know that the local nature is devastated by the Countish, trees preaching to the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite protests of the frontal Loraxe, a hidden, fiery creature, who "counts for trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant PR tasks were given a helper who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a piece.
Speaker Downing Street said that the text was probably from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron's employee provided the text, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of England's oblivion, but he's still holding
Consistent with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England has selected for this tour, I think it will be a repetition of the slaughter 3-0 suffered last time in the trial series, not very likely.
I wouldn't be able to rule out a guest's win either.
The website of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good sleepers in this bat room as well as collective thinking; they will not carry scars from 2012, only juvenileity.
The ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the team of England in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is hard for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that the players are critical based on performance.
For example, there were no questions about Joe Root’s name, which led to the announcement, because — and I had already mentioned this — players are their best selections.
A few more decades and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance was not 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time does a bat get to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven jaws — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could remcite is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's the bat I'm evaluating very positive.
He's the x-factor's croquet player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us on Trent Bridge field, which kind of did.
He must have been given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors had, but of course all this will depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen starts with Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was carried over and I had no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a ostrekaker can't set off, and this left man has already shown himself that he's an amazing player at the Cricket.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 trials before his 2001 performance.
At once, they gave him three centuries, and he didn't even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and I can see it as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selections decided for youth.
There's a lot to learn about this tour.
In addition to the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
The name of Mahel Jaywardene, the Srí Lanka bat, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playful guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming in part of a white-ball tour and bringing to the team both energy and a merciless spark.
I always felt that he was directly born into the world of an international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellectual that can be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, even though they are voices that say consistent things that have been spoken before, can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's partner, Ben Stokes, got one day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree on it, trainers and collectors do not create a timetable.
And you must remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
Unimaginated renegotiation strategy by David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting to another problem with every last day without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn led by the Work Party, or TUC takes the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday to parada on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyna and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is hiding in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough British egocentric agendas, sharing concessions and moving changes in contracts that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided not to want social protection.
We can even call it selfie of Dave and George's agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, make a photo of themselves in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants not to look into the UK in Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin, suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they do not care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been with the power of 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes wrong, as it was for too long-lasting Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande is facing re-registration or replacement in 2017.
His power falls too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist government on the right hand, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how they break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatistic trends.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately untapped SNP style notes during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to succeed in the Brexit process, claiming to be a friend.
"Requisitions have solved the problem" and "Britan has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans, for their own sake, know how expensive Fleet Street can be and how sceptical against the EU are printing oligarch barons, because they were not in the referendum inspired by Tony Benne in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can possibly remember Boris Johnson's name, the falsified Euro-oportunist who made his name as Brussels rapporteur, "EU strike banana" at the beginning of the 1990s.
In spite of his enmity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of non-taxers, non-taxers hacking phones and pseudo-Narth Departments that owned most big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a raging gorilla, you have to throw it with bananas so that you wouldn't be able to have dinner and then have tea.
In fact, Miliband has been more like Blair than Blair himself, as he had sunk Cameron's referendum routine since Blair admitted the principle of the decommitted EU Constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received his bounce card.
The press never forgave him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back on Monday in Westminster, told him that he must not waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of reintroduction of the strategy of boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnok, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marre, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say it nice, develop it.
He claims he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people, despite the crazed tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism, can certainly come to it.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyno's appointment as abrasive McDonnella as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all circumstances" - Benny's phrase - apparently it wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC told his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background, a sensitive picture that Corbyn wants to communicate - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of news remains important in the ages of all-day television transmission and especially in the faith, paranoia and betrayal that are social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Mining Party in the referendum campaign for the self-inflicted campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbynova's basic crushing on EU membership - in accordance with their Benny-based economy, anti-capitarian past - is no longer just a matter of an esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the essence of dogmatic haštering.
Like his crushing on Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - also have suspicious voters - because of Britain’s concession, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday launch of something called the Security Forum of the British influence.
Experts criticise an electronic review published by Public Health England
The statement by the government financed by the Agency about 95 % safer electronic cigarettes than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have a connection with tobacco industry, reports researchers.
Experts in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "limitary" report last month and described it as "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the vastness of data and pointed to the links between some experts and tobacco industry.
In his professional magazine Lancet last month he attacked the "murder base" on which the PHE founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts, who write for BMJ, questioned the claim that was allegedly "set on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public might expect the claims of PHE, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called for an analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on damage associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell states that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously obtained funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the authorisation of public health BAT in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not financing that was allegedly previously obtained from Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some other presences at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report created in this group 'excisely admits' the missing 'hard evidence of the harmful majority of products on most criteria' wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "there is no evidence at the time that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoking for children or non-smokings," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and welfare at PHE, said that the claims at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two life-old smokers will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows, and also what they do not display, especially when there was so much public confusion regarding relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases every year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
The obvious emphasis on current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former Director Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and the Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "don't hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs that will likely only be followed by a handful of people, into complex broadcasts compared to his rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as the BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had failed to make contact with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is entering and sending out programs that would certainly be broadcast without State contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Commission in the Upper Chamber as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain royalties that I am not sure whether they are a good idea in the medium to long term, the production should be reduced at least as regards programmes that do not produce or not supply.
They're sending The Voice on the main broadcast time because they want to get as wide a possible support for the future as possible.
The idea that no one else would ever send him is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed unsponsibly.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced on domestic soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think it'd weaken the BBC in the least possible.
Johnson, a TV player who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by pursuing ratings "for the sake of ambitions of people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular show BBC repeats those who former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more moving public service programs of the BBC "goes to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their powers and they can argue that they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn of licence fees, "But, of course, we do all these fucking programs that no one is looking at."
They're sent in a time when no one's looking at them.
As regards the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission, "I call on you to find a more aggressive system about who gets the best of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who came up before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reithov mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that a small volume of production of the BBC was already classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take public broadcasts in Australia and Canada as a model and change to "information, clarify and have fun".
Elstein’s partnership theme said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on TV, and connect with commercial reporters so that we could all see them online.
‘Sonogenetics’ or brain-cell control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the clay moves.
Scientists raised worms with genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small clay changes the direction at the moment when noise pulses are hit, which are unheard of for the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells to genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, cardiac and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
The Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said for Guardian, that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the patient's brain that stimulate the brain.
They usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found out that the reactions would come up when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves work in ion channels of TRP-4, located in membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open up and activate cells that are connected to them are listed in the Nature Communications Report.
In order to control clay using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels of TRP-4.
When used on such modified ultrasound worms, sound waves were strengthened by microbubbles and moved to worms where they turned on modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar to optogenetics, pioneering tools that enable scientists to turn on and turn neurons off using light.
But Chalasani had heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissues without limitation and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that he would also find his application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Inzerates deceptive British arms trade.
Check out Amnesty International's weapons market video.
Terror killing holes!
The legs windows that break ankles!
Frightening missiles!
And electric stunning shoes that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace of it!
The happy voice and the caricature of metaphors leave no doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the highlight of the willingness of the British government to sell weapons repressive regimes through defense and security equipment International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the removal of posters at bus stops and meters which require a second view.
"The most important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the letters with the brands of London Metro with DLR lines, becomes the image of the tank.
In September this year, there will be a number of arms dealers taking a meeting at the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collection called Special Patrol Group was helped to distribute all over London and through "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen keys, which allegedly "strange access to about a third of the advertising area of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not screwed up by this lyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the collecting Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to works with activists within protest movements and realize that they must get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the arms trade in passengers' health in the subway.
The video Amnesty was seen on Facebook by over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCP Agency working without any permission to honor and graphic designer and commentator worked for free as well.
Creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by a silently surrounding ad about arms trade - saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of a more realistic corporate advertising, but "the addition of varied colors and animations, I felt that they would get more people."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK to take measures and ensure that the torture device does not legally deal with our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding trade with weapons comes from the ExCeLu inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemist products.
Saab's press release revealed an order from the U.S. Army on the AT4CS RS.
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for life on student colleges
11 years ago, I moved to college as an indiscriminate 19-year-old boy, still believers in baret and moral relativism, but until now I enjoy the tense smiles of those I've played - and numerous, long complaints against others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the track can move from slightly to the nerve moving to the totally shocking.
It's attractive to fool around: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year of break, what's your opinion on Corbyn, and why "you don't actually love Marmite, because people, it's just the HAHAHA quastary extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to take a breath - ask and express their interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find people you like, and those you wouldn't have fun with even if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they would've given out fire extinguishers.
Leave people room.
People often turn into a drinking reception, a place of film evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress up and dress their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college will come in short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of tracks are changing to an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social, and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can go back to the energy I've used for an interview with you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization and maybe write him a knock place.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One kid in my dorm was in the habit that if the door wasn't locked, he's invited in.
He's seen a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to college at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and making a TV with baked cakes seems to be slightly less odd, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something warm, now smile while I ask you personal questions."
It's a good way to offer domestic delicacy.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up putting your face on top of a delicious surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of you being a deceptive baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and fat probably cancels that the others will pretend to sleep if you try to knock on their doors.
Theft of food is a common crime in college college.
Stealing the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're stuck inside.
If someone steals something, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate who changed her milk for washing dishes to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't be making sounds that disturb people from sleep or studying.
It's not just about being a dedicated human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could get a little drum and bass down because they were 3 nights and she had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was to enhance music.
When they finally got quiet at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours and then released her own music out loud, locked the door and left on her three-hour pen.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you were to mess up your future wife, sleep together, break up and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you won't take your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try at least a little bit to talk to your weaknesses.
At an exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unopened room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
Good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the bottle with the water you put into the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite her uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has experienced a busy time in pregnancy with today's seven-year-old.
His daddy broke up with her, and she was made up, and she was alone.
I was dealing with the situation quite quickly - I was looking forward to having a baby and I was looking for a positive at it.
The uncertainty and the fact that I'm alone with a child, I've tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for a long time, remembers Eve's first pregnancy today.
She had already met on the Internet at the cottage of the older Vašek, which they began to talk to about popular films.
Your little Eve and the baby didn't even bring home from the midwife, but he didn't take too much of the part of my stepfather.
"He then pulled off the program for a while," described Eva in the documentary series four in the 3rd.
The Motive third series of Czech TV series is just finding happiness for the second attempt.
Care for Witka and financial security family managed through part-time work and great help from mothers and help aunts.
After all, the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not ruin Vaškov’s affection for Eve.
They have definitely gathered around their second birthdays, and now they understand Vašek as his father, and he also talks to him like that.
Even though she has two adult daughters, she enjoys fatherhood in 60 according to her words, and the children are also more concerned.
In addition to the lid, a two-year-old Leontna was added to them and, finally, two-year-olds.
"Vase entered our family somehow naturally, perhaps even by not speaking much into my relationship with my mother," she thinks smiling Eva.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins of Emma and Ela were born with the imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy.
This is a failure in the production and activity of bile acids, which are then excessively pregnant in the blood and manifesting in particular itching.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn fetus that threatens to give birth and death, mostly after delivery, will disappear spontaneously.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vaškov, although they were only 36 weeks old.
Ems has been put in an incubator at the intermediary department, where Vaškov's niece also works, which has been able to take over and accommodate her.
Elina was bigger and immediately after she was transported from I.I.P. to my room, she describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the hospital until the doctors agreed to release the baby, which in the meantime managed to reach the border of two kilos.
Waiting for kids to pick up at Eve's midwife, but it didn't.
"I was crazy about my husband's steak and kids," remembers the hard times for a department of six-year-old mothers.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including one doctor’s insensitive approach.
This, however, did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins to domestic care.
The story of four pregnancy and birth sends ČT1 on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
A total number of families can make up for themselves.
They live together in a small house close to Prague, where Eva had to have a two - year - old and distressed environment.
Although Domček did not grow up, Your Majesty made Eve happy by installing the gas cook to prepare food for six people more comfortable.
If he's not eating, we'll be changing for a cab.
Eva is convinced that children especially feel family comfort and pleasant atmosphere, rather than size or passivity of the house.
For the time being, we were hanging out pretty well, better than we thought.
Even though the mess is worse to hide in a small space and the rousing babies sometimes cross, but at least we're all around, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side on every situation.
Vaškov's work of lighting in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
That's why sometimes he goes to Prague street like a taxi driver.
In his 60 years, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long but how long does it take?
"I realize that given our age difference, it will be one of us who will feed this family," admits Eve on a plane when asking for a future question.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not the only one with the employer.
And if it's worst, we can do taxis with my husband, playing nice blonde.
Apple's had a Jo-jo effect.
It's all the screens.
A more powerful processor, a camera with greater resolution, firmer noise or a display that recognizes the strength of the touch, these are in short the advantages of recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Applu was that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the failure of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus weight grew by 14 grams in a smaller model, with a larger 20 grams.
On one hand, it is not surprising, last year's arbiting environment in Apple's pockets has suffered greatly.
The shasis news is so more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which has also been reflected on weight.
But they have a much greater impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology to make the display discern the strength of the touch.
To that end, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays increased more than twice compared to the previous generation.
For smaller iPhone of 12 grams of 29 grams, in the case of a larger of 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s is so the most difficult display used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this news even thanks to the decomposition bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, it is the most difficult part of the battery used, but its weight has not changed compared to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase in the display is evident.
Weight 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As far as the new technology of the display is concerned, it will be displayed only when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, 25 September, when iPhoni 6s and 6s Plus will be available in selected countries.
Is the flakes breakfast champions tens of thousands of years?
In Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists were able to find, which opens interesting possibilities.
There are traces of sitting in modern people from different times, including wall paintings, remains of instruments and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to tools is dated about 30,000 years ago, however, scientists discovered something that very much resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oat grain found in the place, which apparently went through the process of producing so popular flakes today.
The grains first wet today, then the droughts, the so-called regiments, then they burn and spread the naplocho.
In the Paglicci cave, grain was discovered, which seemed to have been warmed or burnt, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this suggests traces of use on two stone in the cave.
So scientists could not prove in their publication PNAS magazine that there would be a complete production process in the cave, but similarity is really very obvious.
We also have no evidence of how people of flakes could eat, but the presumption that it was with some fluid and possibly quite warm, is of course offered entirely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agricultural production.
As long as the Italian interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes passed on to agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New reports of stations in Brno Town Transport Company.
So once again, I listened to the name of the stop in Trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Przak, Frazova, Spratecký.
Sure, the trolejbus was a little louder, so the male voice report was a little less understandable than before when the stops reported with a female voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in a deeper noise of traffic, it's better noticeable than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that these voters chose passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one, asked me, but it certainly was chosen from studio recordings carried out in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the bus engine frame.
I've been living in Brno for several decades, so the right names of all these stops I know of confusion, so I don't need this report, but the strangers from another country who don't know each other, and for which these reports are primarily intended, can be confused, and they can at the final, where they arrived, then claim that the stop they were supposed to get off at was not even reported.
Perhaps the voter's selection - but better to do again - do it again, and this time painted with common traffic noise and speed of the engine, in which the speaker is almost lost in the bus.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of the water stations Heršpice, Šmírov, or then Ponorna in the splattering cord I've gone to in Komárov.
I assume my old man's hearing didn't suddenly get so bad during the only day that the voter changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, comrade Chief.
From the track records.
Today, few people know what the largest and the smartest were the so-called complex audits of the party's government.
I was allowed to remember that.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatch office the minute the radio sounded like it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky you didn't run down with your comrade chief, came a minute before you, and it seems like he's not in the mood," he noted the dispatcher while I signed up for the arrival book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going after districts on the revision of minor mechanics.
I can't do that. There are checks today.
They're all so fucked up, they're terrible.
What is it, anyway?
"You'll see," the dispatcher got hurt.
Next time, you'll be there.
I ran up the hall.
The chief's office door opened and the chief showed up.
Sticky, with a stone face, in perfectly falling same.
"Good morning, Chief," I warmly greeted and quickly turned on two buttons of a jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran out to the second floor without knowing the cold, evil tone that the old one answered.
"You're playing," the engineer Eva welcomed me, an old lady I've been very fond of.
They say she was even chief before the comrades took her down.
They're clearances, and you're gonna get there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks were, but no one wants to talk about it.
I hear they're three years away from here, they've all got to be with them, and it's very uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I said I'll see.
I pulled a fascil out of the drawer with periodic reports and the phone.
"This is Holcman, come straight to me," the chief's voice came in.
What's he bothering you?
Now we met and nothing... mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone but their thoughts.
"Good day, comrade Chief, I came to your command," I checked out, I barely entered the office.
The chief was sitting behind the desk writing and looking at some lejstro.
"My comrade mechanizer," he said after a while, without raising his head, and he kept looking through the lejstro, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the lejstro on the table, leaned against the back of the chair and leaned on me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, timid view.
I'm not happy.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me that I had worked very well in those few months and was satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon.
And now this?
You realize you're a tracker technique, and you've got to act on it.
Such a greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I've been telling you that I've been using this kind of greeting since I was so raised and that I've seen nothing wrong with him.
It was like a red turkey cloth on the chief.
"You're on the socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the bloated chief.
And besides, you're still confused with calling the superiors.
You say "sir" one time, and the second time, "sister."
But I'm no chief for you, Mr. Chief, but so is the Chief.
Staff members are comrades of the magistrates, chief tratchmasters are comrades of the top trackmaster!
Remember that kindly!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I have greeted you with regular civil greetings.
There's nothing wrong with it... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," the cold told the chief who had a little calm in the meantime.
But we're still talking about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have the chair up here to retire.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone something was not his choice, it didn't look good with the guy in question.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, timid view, and I was looking for the words I would answer.
I was also upset with his high-end sticking.
He was only a few years older and played Lord God, actually comrade God.
He's alive, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was right now.
He's all screwed up.
So be it, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the party organization, as well as all the parties, but also the insurgents, he threw.
But the Chief of Staff has pushed many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
He just shot me for a complete mess.
I thought a little bit about my ass, and it cost me a lot of extortion so I wouldn't shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the crimson's den anymore, let's just keep doing the irritating official.
What would I use for two kids?
And a house built to do it!
I was in a break, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can do so far, you can go," finished the audience of the chief and started to look back through the lejstro he had in his hand.
At midnight, they called me in.
Everyone from the office was there and asking what and how, they said it would be okay.
Only Jožin bited, as his practice used to be, that they could not throw us all out because there would have to be a second chief on the job alone with his loyal ones, and that he would not be threatened.
The word "sister" also pointed out that he knew what the old man shot me for this morning.
There was a pretty sleazy in the head office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table, another comrade who should have decided on my office stay or non-residentship.
Kadrák, President of ROH, staff logger, special purpose reference, something goes on in the military, and Deputy Chief.
And also the most important person, chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
An ordinary track worker, undercut the washing machine or saws, threw a girdle.
But also a former brat.
It was heard that there was no fun with him that time, said a pretty beast.
Bad languages said that school went out in seventh grade, didn't learn anything, couldn't do anything.
And when the criminal canceled, he ended up at the crimson's house.
But, comrade, yes, the comrade was canned!
Chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an uncoached neck.
Kadrák read the views of the Civil Committee from his place of residence.
I come from a business family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
So far, it's good, I've thought, and I've had a little bit better breathing.
Then a review from the street organization of the party.
That was a copy of the civil committee's opinion, perhaps both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term members of the party refused to come before the clearance committee and then came out, allegedly for health reasons.
The Chief looked at me hard.
The wizard noticed and stopped reading.
Chief said to keep going.
It was worse than that.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was acquired for a party candidate.
No matter what the parents who came out, the party gave me confidence.
But I was married and married besides the National Committee, I also had a church.
I have failed the worst way of trusting the party.
That's why I was cut out of the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, made a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
In all of this, I express a negative attitude towards the leading position of the party.
When the bucket was finished, only the knockout of the chief's pencils to the table interrupted the tight silence.
Everyone looked at me on the other hand, and I wanted me to be somewhere far away.
I kept repeating myself in spirit, "Communists - superhuman, communists - superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay at the blacksmiths?
I could've fixed the vents without some fucking clearance.
But now?
The senior officer's career was taken for her before she started.
Go back to platoon?
I don't think that's gonna happen, but I'm sure the chief's gonna blow me out for an hour.
"Second, how did you check out the comrade here?" interrupted the tight silenced chief question on the blacksmith.
Well, according to the previous employment statement.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, it wasn't too many times for the chauffeur.
He looked nervous at the hideouts of sweat like he was checked out himself.
The chief put some paper on him.
"No," said the chief with a sign of jealousy, which often used to be the forefront of the storm.
At first sight, he was praised, taught with honor, graduated from industry, worked as a lock, standard for 100 percent on average.
But it's not important.
Where did you get that statement, comrade?" he turned again to a kadrak who felt like it was starting to turn against him and that he might not have even had to be a kadrak very soon.
This is where the comrade gave it to me on board.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the platoon to the platoon," bloctal.
And that's where the judgments don't require, his was kind of extra, so I put him in his file.
"So when you were included in the technical function, this line of paper was enough for you," the draught said the chief.
The castor was nervous and unanswered.
"No, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the matter, and apparently, it's relieved.
For the time being, he stopped it.
"So what about you, comrade?" The chief turned again to me.
All of a sudden, it's over!
In my eyes, I was so confused, I was so hot.
He was followed by anguish and accusation, and I knew I was the most resistant creature in a world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That I put the substituent opinion into error by the comrade of the caste referendum, and I didn't understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an antisocial living that, at the time of building real socialism, supports the re-emergence of religious darkness, ba, even participates in them.
That, there was a lot of things I've committed, or maybe I'm still committed and I've been praying to end it.
I don't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if I got the shell.
This is a work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people like I was in the eyes of the comrade.
"That's enough, comrade Chief," the chairman of the party suddenly called and strongly interrupted the Chief Left.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake! He's made a stupid mistake!
But he's already had his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than if we shut the door to the side for a while!
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is once again worthy of our trust.
An illegitimate brat spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so read or did the phrase from partial training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not just you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young man, the truth, a somewhat misguided comrade, to support his efforts to correct him!
It's your party duty no one's gonna get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty, too, to all of us.
This is where the comrade needs to see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, he does not only punish, but that he loves too.
When the Prime Minister's over, nobody even looked.
No one expected such a turnover.
At least I did.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade President," the Chief of the Council of the United Nations took over the initiative.
If you had let me speak, you would have heard that I was headed for that conclusion.
They all gave their attention to their heads, but it was clear to them that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate researcher for basic resources," I failed when I returned to the office, and I cried back.
I'm glad, except for Eva's engineer, they've all been to lunch.
That little thing was listening to my unconscionable seasoning of fresh experiences, and I just calmed down.
When I was done, she asked me to have some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she built water for a cook and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about kadrová practice.
As one assessment, often full of praises, they put a man in their hands, and the other one, in which there is dirt, will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had it, but at the clap at the crackhouse, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our bucket?
He's the only one who's old to eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"The one that's taken from the old one," she said wickedly.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
You'd better keep an eye on him anyway, he's very vengeful.
What about the party president?
Basically far worse, no humane.
Well, it's a corrupt thing with great power.
The coffee water started to scream and the office filled with a smell of hot coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in a cup and a hot potion mixed the milk.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
He won't fire me now, and the next checks are in three years.
Anyway, comrade Chief, he's not just gonna forget me that day.
It was published in LITERAL ARTISTICS ON TRATI II in the publishing house of the EPIKA
The alien symbol has come to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is turning again after years.
You can see from a distance, because it's located at 15 meters high.
People around here call him Chlum's wind.
For the village, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal mark, which the municipality gained on the occasion of the 2010 census.
"We asked for a sign at the time, and of course we wanted a fan on the mark, knowing it around everyone," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when these people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
Until 1910, the Colombian representatives decided to solve the solution, which was then in line until the mid-80s.
In the village at the branch office in Chichov, they left them to dig up seven meters of deep well.
Three years later, they completed metal constructions with wind pump, which pumped water into the reserve at the highest point of the village near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia by 2 400 crowns," says the memorial inscription on the ground covering of the construction of the barn.
After several repairs and downfalls, the wheel was served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began: that day at Chlum began to serve a new water pipeline.
The Great pump has already remained an unfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant was involved in the attack of the natives this year.
Until in 2008, the Chlumsians decided that the wind wheel would repair again and move again.
They had a replica made of the original wheel, reduced on average by six feet.
The wheel was planted on the barn, but it had to be brought down that same year.
The replica producer did not select the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist windtimes.
After that, the Chum Dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, as of June this year, the wheel on the high rails is turning again.
On the occasion of the encounter of the natives, the village had a replica of the wheel repaired and rescheduled it to the top of the railway tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only into the ambushed shoulder blind.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there were few water in the well.
At least it was done empty.
"In autumn, then, we will remove the shafts of the wind wheel from the pump in the dry basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind wheel got into the general sign, but is the only village of this kind on the whole of Vysočina.
A similar feature in the mark is used in honor of local technical monuments in Chvalkovice and Green Hora in Vyškovsk, Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
Not bad, but I don't know Lafatu, she's admitted the support of Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, as everyone in my career," smiled at the 34-year-old Goian for the pre-pasation press conference.
We were trained by Georghe Hagi back then. It was bad luck for us to lose.
I hope I can score Sparta.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 games for the Romanian team is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, talking about the Greek fight with the Spartan Hybsh.
And he's partially aware of what he might be waiting for on Thursday night.
I know a lot of Fatai who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club did not name, and so came a direct question to see if David Lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and had a slightly calculated view aimed at Czech journalists.
The helpless expression in his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a little while of quiet, he started it.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
And Laphata?
I'm not wrong, but I don't know anyone else but Fatai.
The bad guys know very well about Goian.
"My experience in larger clubs, it can be said that keeping the defense of Asteras, it's such a game organizer," observed the Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
The Goian has been behind the best years, but he can boast a very interesting football resume.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Sutton, both United and City Manchester units, but Steauy headed for Italian palerma, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European Cups, pens for victory in the Czech League.
For me, he's a favorite at this game, but we're playing at home and we want a group to start off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, said Goian.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the company's share in Warsaw storm.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have taken for the time being within the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no real impact on events in society, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the group's headquarters, shareholders consider the placement of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into Prague Burza of securities, the company completes a prospectus of valuable paper, which will be presented soon by the Czech National Bank for approval.
Transfers of holding premises and related transfers of shares shall be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with the participation of only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public write-down shares or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"The offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," said the company.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could be made up of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offer on stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of shares also in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The objectivity test of the Czech TV in information about the migrants crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balanced reporting of major Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news broadcast of the Czech Television.
And how did it go?
When they are taught at the School of Journalism about how media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcasts of Czech Television Events.
The Migrant crisis has been devoted about 80% of the news broadcast.
Up to the first minute, when the ČT informed about concerns at the Serbian-Maddar border and the attacks of migrants on police called the euphemistically lost their patience - throwing stones and attacking metal poles), the current promigran propaganda was driving - please review the names of the individual reports.
Critics of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the bad treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees, not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Punishing fugitives - ČT consistently uses the words runner or fugitive and not the migrants.
The overwhelming thing is that the CT uses consistent only and only small children and women images in the illustrations.
In the same transmission, she stated that there are 80% of the men in the Czech Republic who were detained from migrants.
Summary: Most of the propaganda, which has no similarity to the communist agitators.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
I soon stopped being the only resident.
I got fish in my bathroom.
Domestic fishes, insects with imperfect change, i.e., that does not make the oneover from the craniumhouse and the youth looks like an adult individual, just a tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore for their destruction provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or something else?
However, it destroyed them successfully.
Later, I dealt with Pharaohs alike.
A box with some juvenist who brought an ants into the nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth at the fleas and the puppies, I don't think I'd be able to make myself sick of the karma of their killing.
In the new flat, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don't come down our throats, let them eat loose skins in peace, some of those invisible eyelashes and so on.
Their quiet existence disrupted the spider after time.
It was a common kind of spider who lived on the ceiling for the long time.
We thought he was living out of occasionally musculatures and mosquitoes, which just made us more comfortable.
Since he has been here for several years, we have discovered that he lives mainly with fishes and that their number has probably been maintaining on the kidnapped number.
Confidential regular contact in every need we found out she's a female.
For we have witnessed romantic words with a partner about a third smaller, as carefully brown to the thread of the web so as not to be eaten before it reaches a longing collulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move, and they didn't even react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where love play was played, later we found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a lot of little spiders hanging out of the neighborhood.
Soon they disappeared.
They were devoured by their mothers, by their works they spread elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared for a week.
If she left or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little less, probably the daughter of the great-grandmother toilet.
For some time from the ceiling, she watched carefully our behavior and moved under the toilet bowl, evaluated our failure to act as friendship.
The number of fished fishes had fallen again and the spider looked at his normal activities to ensure food.
The whole year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
Our daughter, among this, grew up to be the age of being embarrassed by the use of the night.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've been eating it forever.
We encouraged her increasingly to use the toilet.
However, the daughter found an excuse for keeping her habit in the spider, which she saw very well in her escape.
Our talk about the spider seeing, the happiness of her mother's house was never taken.
We were crying and screaming, she forced her night after night.
It wasn't too much.
There was a time when a spider had to take place, in order to move his daughter forward, to rule.
It's on me.
He was caught in a glass and ordered over a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I've still felt so bad after my life as if I'm throwing my family away.
We assumed that fishes would appear more frequently and begin to multiply by geometric series.
The world wonders, week, two, there's no sign of it.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider on an antler's pattern had any idea that the bathroom environment was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they're back together.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their connection to the spider had to have a reason to believe that when he didn't see him being hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some sort of alarming reaction.
I'm not making any illusions about them.
They showed some light of the pistachio, but they would react to a wave of hands or fast movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's forgotten about the night care.
It's just to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't close the eclection for me.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that cycle B.
Desatero's statements from Albert Einstein, which has enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the past century seem to cease to be fascinating.
He was able to dive deep into everything, that the explosion was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, people have come into the awareness of their special and general theory of relativity, which has so far been best described by the universe in its giant affair.
It is also not possible to forget its clarification of photofection or the idea of quantification of electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-contribution and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex that for many people, they prefer to allow easy lines for a closer knowledge.
However, it is not easy.
Of course, it would not be Albert Einstein, if even this did not find a brilliantly simplified explanation: The Hour near your beloved seems a minute; a minute in the hot furnace seems an hour - and it is relative.
I've allowed myself from his entire cover of famous quotes to choose those ten that literally embraced me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not exactly sure about the first one.
No amount of temptation can ever prove I was right.
But only at any time can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break a atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's gonna fight in World War 3, but it's gonna be sticks and stones in the fourth.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to handle the problem my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis, and 5 minutes by his solution.
In the world, the hardest thing to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself not to mention Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is working, Y rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlínský kraj expect changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider all four of us staying in black numbers this year," said the captain Stanislav Misák happy.
The total profit of regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at this point.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Kroměž, Vsetín, Uherský Hradiště, and Zlína, this will help build nearly 1.5 billion crowns together.
The long period when we bought mainly instruments is over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care can't, he justified the plans of the regional Deputy for Health Lubomír Nečas.
The changes are looking forward to all hospitals.
They'll be coming to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they now choose a supplier of the new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
They have a scheduled dialysis port in the area.
Uherský Hradiště wants to build a new internet for about 200 million this year.
And the Zlína Bať's hospital awaits a long-lost construction of a new central income and an Internet that will need three-quarters of billions.
In all cases, it is essential and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors this is an extremely important step," said Věra Prousková, for example, to build an internal internal director of the hospital.
The five-storey building is to be finished in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which will be significant for patients mainly, will be affected by all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are unbleached, the windows of the sealant and the health care professionals do not have the right working conditions.
"For example, our internet was built twenty-five years ago, and now it is at the border of its lifetime," Pavel Calabek pointed out.
It will therefore be replaced within a few years by a seven-storey modern building connected to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will then have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to new premises.
The same model is already in the middle of the Uherské Hradiště.
Central reception is already in place, and within three years it will be joined by an intern.
"We will pay the status from a loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sládek.
This particular hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
Profit's still highest, and she didn't get into the loss two years ago, when maybe the oil hospital was dealing with nearly two hundred million.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, we increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an economy in charge.
Impairment is also expected by patients outside the cross-border hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, he will go to repairs, new equipment and reconstruction to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, there will be a final repair of the detention station, then the dialysis port, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister vnitra Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that the other Czech countries are pushing to accept quotas for the transition of refugees, but no discussion is denied.
He also points out that no one has explained how assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should keep up when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chován told the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meetings of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas like a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're headed somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we can keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing 40 grand a couple of years ago, and now it's a hundred twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how are we supposed to keep these people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't even want anyone to join us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnameses, and others who take the Czech Republic as the target country are gaining asylum in us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, namely Syria and other countries, is limitedly close.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't really want to come to us, but 15 hundred people were already committed to accepting.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We pledged to accept 1,500 people, but with condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1500, there will be 1100 people to whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our hospital and we'll treat them the same way we did to those we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe whether we can hold people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in a way that if it is to be registered, they cannot be detained.
That means, they will come to our territory with registrations, and if there is a deal that is not yet yet, we may not hold those 1100 in the Czech Republic, and they will go back to Germany after they arrive.
If we can hold them for asylum proceedings, we will be able to conduct asylum procedures with them.
If it is Syria's citizens, Eritrea, nearly 98 percent of the European statistics receive international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will stay.
This is the second project that is still going on, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them get employment, housing and so on.
But that's a run on a very long track.
You said other states were not willing to discuss at the meeting of ministers.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic merely rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step to unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solidarityal step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive to all the migrants from Syria can reach them, the message is spread in the order of hours after all the camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the road is the protection of external borders - simply to discourage migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Unequivocally, they have no chance.
50 thousand Kosovan came to Germany only last year.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state councils.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, the 50 percent of what they spend on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany carried out checks, the number of prisoners in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
Where's it going to go to make border checks even stronger?
We were afraid of getting caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We've still got a few hundred available places in stone detensive devices.
Of course, all the people we hold will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it standard.
The Rakusians are the only people who take these people with us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely unnecessary story.
Where's the break point then?
Does it have to be 1,000 a day?
I think it'd have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days, we have enough capacity to have a crisis plan.
Then I'm agreed with Mr. Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we've been in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation occurs, the government may hold de facto immediately and by one resolution decide to strengthen the police on the military, give it a customs administration, or a prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional state which now declared Hungary at some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Note that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen in the Czech Republic, and I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will attempt to reverse the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would touch it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of debts for the last minute.
They're trying to prevent the bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off her debts.
Even footballers were able to get their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time in an insolvent court proceedings.
Almost three months after the offer of Online Services from the Pacific Samoa company was made for it for about 20 million crowns.
Judge Michael Wenzl, in a few hours, was trying to convince the lawyer Slavie Zuzana Mládková that he was not supposed to report a bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that the argument had been made.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, money came from new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also demonstrated by Slavie's statement before Tuesday's trial - the upper club on Monday, only the day before the hearing in court, sent the due tens of millions of crowns.
"All was paid between 11 September and 15 September," said the lawyer Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
More specifically, the Slovak ex-representant of Milan Ivan and Czech backup director Maria Ličkov.
Slavia has also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenicke.
Already on Friday, the club paid even the due fees of the city part of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvent dispute, they remain de facto claims that are contrary to Slavie.
Either according to the club, the undertakings in question did not exist at all, or they are being brought to trial.
However, we are prepared in the event of a loss of these disputes to pay the amount.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can file with the bill," said Judge Mládková.
"All that was after maturity is paid," said Mládková, and added that there were no outstanding or disparated commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
It is therefore possible to expect the decision in November first.
The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on third November.
However, the decision shall not fall within this meeting, but in writing after it.
Medal for the Finns and the Rakusians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of invertors' wreaking resources.
The combination of high-tech, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and quick return on investments in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final compilation is always configured according to customer requirements.
Any of this, from welding of construction steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in boats.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple settings and expansion of the welding source enables you to react quickly to changing requirements, which leads to a reduction of simplicity, to the need to convert resources and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows you to welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which provide higher productivity and quality welding.
Time is no longer spent and there is no waste of material or repairing faulty wreaths.
It provides flexibility, is less straight, more welding and higher benefit.
It is this year's news, which had the Prime Minister in Nitra, where she also won the gold medal.
We appreciate these respects very much because they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The leading world manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but thanks to differences in software and parameters management, FastMig X belongs to the top world.
For those who are interested, it is certainly pleasant to include delivery time, which is around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts that will definitely expand after the Brno fair.
We have been present for over 20 years by its regular participants and almost always our business results are better than before, stressed for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi Store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final compilation is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka went to build so it wouldn't fall apart.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert in the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanku's gone more secure, says an expert.
Blanka's Tunnel complex was able to build so that there were no two landslides in the Prague Stromce, says the production director Satra, which is the main tunnel designer, Alexander Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday night during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
But he believes it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"Tunel went to beat safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially," said Butovič.
The conditions in Stromovka have been the same all along, yet the country has fallen only a few steps away from where it began to be more secure and more cautious.
"If the measure were applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
Tunnel Blanka fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, the crater was formed in Stromov, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohead, the tunnel is too expensive, said the Euro week.
The construction was based on the original purpose of the cost of CZK 17 billion.
When we add VAT to that, which has doubled over the construction period, of 17 billion you have 21.
When you add technology, purchases of land and engineering, valorization and similar items to this, it's 29 billion, which is no longer so far from 37, said Whitehead
Someone ordered that and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get new iPhone operating system with new Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and select "Software Update".

FedEx Zisky mixed, reduction in fiscal perspective for 2016
FedEx reported unrest results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of the year’s profit due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the soil division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holiday.
In this period of last year FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The shares fell by about 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for a fiscal year that ends next May, which means a 20 cents decline from previous predictions.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to the survey performed by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite an increase in interest rates on average by 4,9 percent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher aids for land transport heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to a reduction in costs, increased income and growth in online trading.
The President of the Board and the CEO of Fred Smith said that "the company has demonstrated firm performance despite its weaknesses than the expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
The holiday acquisition plans were notified the day after the rival company UPS stated that it was planning to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which was probably the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $12.33 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a fall in priority international shipping, which has led to a stagnant income in its Express Unit.
But boom online shopping enhanced the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, income has increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The Express Unit recorded a higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher prices for labour force.
In pre-trade, about an hour before FedEx opened, the shares fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of June 11th.
At its most expected meeting for years, federal lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at 27 feet of the long Dutch mahogany table and decide whether after nearly ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
The two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States at one end of the central bank's ornament.
The map is a reminder of the fact that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the nation economic interests over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining its prices stable.
However, from the Great Recession of the representatives of the Fed, there is an unscrupulous third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the American economy is ready to be released when depriving from unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot from the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a solid growth of the economy, recent tourism on the global financial markets could already be absorbed by adding to the volatility by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than by just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will first be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the degree, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is already giving them sufficient reason to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed will do, which itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently asked by Blomberg anticipated a rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect that the Fed will delay the matter, with a key indicator only about 30% of the chances to increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if Fed would increase the rates, only if the politicians were to decline by promising that I would not see the next increase.
On Tuesday, the industrial diameter of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The meeting was launched by expecting Fed politicians to hold the rates peaceful this week, says John Loński, the lead economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise for Fed to raise the rates," he states.
If the Fed politicians did this, "they'd have to go to the extremes of their programme statement and hold the financial markets to keep their hands on the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in the rates would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty of how Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on a good way to raise the rate by 0,25 percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early years, he expects to increase the rates in this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in over seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full of employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And although inflation continues to be below 2% of the central bank’s target, Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, having regard to the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to dissuade in the end of last month after China devalred its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by 16% below its record value in May when investors were afraid that the slowing Chinese economy would go down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected in this month and Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the flower max.
Fed’s political factors provide a comprehensive calculus when to start increasing interest rates.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening on this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the US economy, and there are almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, the mere sign of President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "go ahead" their monetary expansion on the market has launched cramps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely connected, it can be expected that the representatives of the Fed follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to read better the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global strategy for wealth-Management by Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of movements in financial markets that seem to be independent of economic foundations."
Lacker, the voting member of the Federal Committee's policy on the open market, which pushed on the increase in tariffs, quoted the decision in the years 1998 to99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction in its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions "In spite of the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives turned these cuts.
The Fed should prefer concern for financial stability only during the major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England Committee.
The most recent screams do not even come near this level, he said.
"You really don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.

The speed on the highways will remain on the old side.
Speed to 150 km/h The House has rejected.
On selected sections of motorways, the maximum speed allowed under favorable conditions up to 150 km/h will not be increased.
On Tuesday, the House decided, when it came to an amendment of the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment to the land transport law is now headed for the president.
President Miloš Zeman has already said by the end of April that the law allowing the traceadéticometric speed to enter.
The increase was also the Minister of Transport Dan JAK (for ANO), according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built on such speed.
In Tuesday, before the Members, Jok supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in the speed from 90 to 110 km in the hour on selected first class roads, especially four-proud roads.
In the first place, the House extended this possibility on a highway on which it would be possible to ride in selected sections at up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now joined his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport from the amendment, also authorised transport police to have the last word in the adaptation of local communications that the municipality cares about.
The Senate version approved by the House also counts in order to allow the sewerage, water or public lighting cables to be stored longitudinally below the surface of the vehicles.
The alien would've saved money for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be required to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
Novela also has the help of improving road protection and facilitating the handling of abandoned vehicles which the owners do not report to.
The new municipality could sell to the withdrawn vehicles which, within six months of notification of withdrawal, do not notify their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines even for freight companies.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing an electronic highway mark instead of existing paper which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
We're going to court with the U.S. Exprimator.
He's been threatened for 10 years by the overrated welcome of the Giants.
The case concerns the allegedly overrated visa project of the Giants.
The police wanted to sue Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD), the Chamber of Deputies, but they did not deliver it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, two up to ten years of prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two October days.
According to the D.A. Mandik and Macecek, at least one million crowns have caused damage to the charges.
The applicant leans on the expert opinion.
The former members of the city management according to the applicant’s title of their duties have made it illegal to obtain the property benefit of the company that organised the welcome of the aliens.
Mandik, according to the prosecution of the current Head of the Magistrate Department of Urban Services, Education and Culture, ordered him to address five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company, who offered the lowest prize, entered the competition, the mayor of the competition canceled.
The contract then had to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore, who then assigned the city council to the competition.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were carried out to ensure that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the holding of the visal event at Ústí nad Labem in the long-term and coordinated action was at least contrary to the requirement for the care of the proper manager, writes the state's representative.
At the same time, he was aware that Darothore subsequently cleared Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the visa event the price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company, according to the bill for the project, has invested more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one portion, approximately CZK 1.7 million, then the contract quits.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least one million crowns overrated.
Mandik has already rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crimes, I'm innocent.
I don't understand these designed rubber, he said earlier, former mayor, that the city under his leadership was simply linked to a similar project from past years.
In 2008 to 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
"It was on the same terms, with the same money," Mandnik added.
Criminals wanted to be charged originally with Mrs Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Deputies didn't bring her out for prosecution.
As a result, criminals put off bail in her case, but they expect Kail's accusations after the parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcome of the villages was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police reportedly let the dog escape.
Then they got the journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police on the border with Serbia briefly arrested an AP cameraman and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
The Hungarian government is questioning this charge.
A remarkable incident took place on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees, police officers were involved and one of them had a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on the top.
The dog of the man who yelled, "Please, I'm a fugitive," says Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything, he noticed one of the policemen and wouldn't let him leave.
Then the reporter couldn't make a phone call to his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
Police officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what was recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
The music thus lost the result of two days work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protester letter to the Hungarian government of Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of police officers in him was unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and do not need to be afraid that the government will destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovács appealed to Music's police statement of events.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they made him get nothing.
"The dogs can bark - they are trained to drool and a little overwhelming, but they did not attack with certainty," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
The win on City kicks us in, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," he was banging Manuel Pellegrini's head, Coach City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic league champion game.
Not one team has created too many opportunities, but the ball on the dome had longer us.
"The crucifixion was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," he evaluated Pellegrini's match, whose team was in competition for long 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season on this was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league had as a defense only a point and with score 2:4 is located at 16th place of the table.
That's why Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This award will help us mentally, kick us in," says Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester, Pogba, Manchuc and Morata took over.
"It's true, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we will find the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we line up among the best men in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially at the attack stage.
This result deserves my players.
"At the same time, we could, on the contrary, go to 0:2, but Gianluigi kept us," praised Coach Allegri's goalie Buffy.
"We've burnt some good chances," told Yaya Tourý, the backup agent of City.
We must take experience from the League of Champions and try a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angela, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all the media shaking around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, it's downhill as well.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today the newspapers and the media are full of kids who carry their parents on dusty ways of exodus.
This automatically causes guilt and compassion in a person - in Europe.
Well, they don't just come in here and look at the pictures of the incoming boats that come to the Greek islands that the kids don't see them that much!
Well, somehow, we've been missing pictures of ships on Lampedus, fleeing from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades lay thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared pictures from Callais, where they ate them and the black men are waiting to go through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church of Eritrea did not seem to have a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of this fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of hiding out that it's not just the unfortunate children of Syria, but also the well-earned - for elders: fashioned - young men.
whose shells look like they're just coming out of some fitcentre.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on a private beach in the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And they turned out young black.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked into the beach, all their clothes in branded clothes and shoes, in the hands, whatever, smartphones.
That this is a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - clearly they were afraid of them.
They've taken all the chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on him and was in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On heads of hat with nail, white and colorful adidas on legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started growing.
They sat tables around, stuffed themselves next to sitting next to the guests of the bar - reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and kids ran away from the dining terrace somewhere to relax.
Next black people drank beer right out of a third - how in the US series? - they threw empty bottles around each other on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other loudly.
But it wasn't English.
Then they put themselves in a drink of wine, also in a bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimmers, especially those young ladies - in the water they were screaming and screaming, mothers with children and pensioners got scared, and in half an hour he wasn't on the beach or in the pool, not even one non-black guest.
Everybody's gone.
Whether or not a Christian or a Muslim was.
The staff of the hotel were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the middle of the evening, "Did you see the gold that they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a 20-inch massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like gold.
"They're drug smugglers?" I asked.
"For you have seen them drinking," said the waiter.
They don't do drugs, they don't use it.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it hasn't been so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to follow.
But the secret services and the top politicians should've known that first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today, it turns out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as intellectuals, and on them bound by lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - already publicly recognized major forces in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also EU leaders and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the excited welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow TV image of August 1968.
Of course, there were several Sunflowers at the station, but mostly - old-German - Muslims welcomed their soukmenovky.
For weeks, they've been fooling around on the news on Czech TV, as reported by some research by the Germans, almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
But whoever was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirm further information.
For example, famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Television by the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs were doing.
However, they have hidden what the other day in Germany: that in the survey vote for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - the survey attended 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, she said: "Our desire for multi-culties totally failed."
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for multicultural society."
"All attempts to live with such a life have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she believes that she did not testify a strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live together without integration. Today they live with us and we have been lying for a while that they would not remain that one day they will disappear.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily together, has failed this approach.
He's completely failed.
But Merkel may not have the power to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political integrity.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD Member, the only one who is supposed to have no seniority in the europarliament - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a concentration overseer for a minute - as he has done more times.
It appears, especially under the impressions of German politicians, that Germany exceeded Rubicon.
Let us note that up to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, states which have been victims of Naziism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have tried for years, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are they right to say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the Greats' attempts to control the whole of Europe by all his strength?
When did he say that Germany would destroy the great idea?
I guess I should have.
When he was suspended, she began preparing for World War I.
The idea of a Great German who led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives has probably returned in a different form.
After trying to control the Marxists, such as Rote Armee Fraction, and after failure of the NDR, Germany was based on environmental, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Naziism, started developing new German ideologies.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long prevented the formation of German nationalism, so they leave all those warriors in peace against the atom, excitedly seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people around the world wanting to do something differently and better, they have fully leaned on the side of the anti-heating warriors of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic current - so-called propalestinian - and antislovan current that considers all Slovakias to be a difficult verbez - from the time Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements of Schulz and the German minstrs show, which are openly threatening the unobtrusive eastern states, the idea of leadership in Germany.
Which must be listened without saying no.
You're the one who's white!
And when we mix this up that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind this as always the capital, especially the German one, which is in line with which Germany is, in fact, controlling most of Europe’s states.
The hounding of the sunmen first introduced the Germans into the swamp of environmentalism and multi-cluralism and today brought them home, and perhaps millions of Muslims will still bring them.
Who, lured by the siren voices, will soon hit the reality wall that Merkel won't see, and they will start to storm.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, once again a part of its population - but as it seems, the ever smaller part - the ideologically bloated, but eventually the reality will prove to him as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests object to incoming Islamists?
How will Muslims long live in Germany come to help, but certainly not as loving ones to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, follow the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do with the Germans, and even with Germany, when people who will be loud and publicly protesting against the new euro-administrative Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict created in Europe by the support of solar ideological ideologies, i.e. elite and in principle totalitarian, and by its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of unfamiliar negotiations against unobtrusive democratic Germans and all submissive and unobtrusive Eastern neighbours, this cannot go well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the insurgent sellers: to scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knock on you in a way that the weaker character may not just cease.
A living head will wipe you off, and it will take the ardent one on the way away (or rather accompanies) a caretaker and a lifeless statue.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaking knock can't be done in real life.
Even with us, it would be useful to set up a lot of rashes and junk.
Bedding (Oxalis corniculata).
Small weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is part of the expanding weeds, but looks a nice impression about flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes the dryr environment, she's easy to adapt, modest and difficult.
It creates letters with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking pictures.
Under detail there is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breast feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come in a shocking way to try to treat women with knowledge of the importance of good food while breast feeding through pictures of children who are breast-coated by unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply to infants all nutrients that need to create a powerful immune system.
Due to the shift of energy requirements, pregnant women and newly-peated mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that the increased intake of calories is not the only dietary measure for mothers to follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their children and protected them from tumour development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively influenced the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, although Nine's trying to take over the lead at Today's Show
The reason for Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry in order to cover the costs for the consequences of the escape of the liberal management has failed to create a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
An early show of Nina from the national capital after the collapse of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koch and Samantha Armitage has stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagaran Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny distance to the audience of Aussie TV was so important because it recorded on average 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330 000 audiences broadcast today.
Today recorded a minor increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343 000).
Today, in recent months, it fills the gap on Sunris.
In August, 318 000 were on average in Today compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has 349 000 people on average and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big message for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former Star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about recently widowed father, who decides to move with two children to the New Zealand coastal area, has on average very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
The critics considered whether Thomson could download a TV hit without a Rafters Rebecca Gibney star himself.
The result of last night says yes.
The X Factory from Seven has kept the strong 1,136 million viewers, making it smoothly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Familias (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:30 to 17:30), which was reported by Andrew O'Keefe on average, had 446 000 viewers on average.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 audiences — a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night she had the first half-hour of The Chase Australia on average 520 000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat was on average 620 000.
Thanks to a fall in the assessment The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will eventually win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which could not defeat McGuirov show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezan Markoski may have found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood is with whom he comes to Bachelor is covered by an insurmountable secret.
And three girls who stay standing will certainly not reveal who the real one is who will get a rose after all.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were only two, thanklessly told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut till Thursday final
All three women were singingly why Wood was a perfect man, quote his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?," they may have worked as a connection to whoever gets Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best fit Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a slight relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were compatible enough, and I still think that during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really country woman, she's very funny," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the chemistry between them.
They are well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks that Sam Wood and I could make a pretty good couple.
She claims herself that during her last visit at home, she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized this is not just a game, I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't, if she didn't, would be mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I love both girls anyway - it's between Snezena and Lana inconclusive.
Bachalor's on Wednesday at 7:30 to Ten.

Jarhard Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown great interest in moving to the United States and many teams have been asked after his great start of training last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he made a conversion of the Australian rugbie league at the first kick out of the pitch on Tuesday 20:3 on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into play after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in his wardrobe after the game.
Instead of getting newcomers to get up in front of the rest of the team, he can cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, declared that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of the next game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarhard Hayne fixed his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he left the field after error and later told the Australian Radio Duu Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse the beginning of his career in NFL he couldn't even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the tracks to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in her own goal area led to the three of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for 27-year-old players.
Hayne posted a photograph with fans, which he holds after the games of the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin meet in the discussion on homosexual rights
In 2003 the richest man of Russia Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested by handguns in Serbian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and its democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. became emigrants who tried to pay for the property.
Two were emigrated in 1984 and their properties were acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property was no longer possible to return, so the couple turned to become claims for compensation under the Act on Non-Successive Rehabilitation.
First, the court gave them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim by giving them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price rules.
The emigrants became the Supreme Court, and they were given an originally defendant's fee.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to a complaint against the U.S.
In the intervening period, such a change in the social and economic circumstances has occurred that the compensation granted in accordance with the legislation in force - whereas at that time it would be a refund adequate in relation to the derecognition of property - today it is only a fraction of the property value.
"This cannot go to the burden of other participants as regards the restitution of legitimate persons who have been in their right since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant a refund earlier," explained the rapporteur, Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ÚS stood on the side of the emigrants.
"The ECA repeatedly expressed itself in order to ensure that the general courts proceed in restitution matters so that any inconsistencies do not be interpreted in failure of the legitimate persons and that the purpose of the restitution is always achieved, that is, the disposal of the property wrongs caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Eviti in music Study DVA is now the official Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišar became the world's youngest Eve when in 1998 she made her role as wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, she says, "To this day, Evath's difficulty did not match much of the performance."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolone recommended her as the first ladies of Argentina.
I saw a monk three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm a whole fan of more modern adjustments, but this one is simply a particularly successful one.
"The regime of Ondřeje Sokola is original, lightened and present," says Fišar.
For the purpose of handing over the musical rod between the two singers, there will be a birthday concert by Monika Absolon on 27 September at Studio DVA.
In the evening, they're going to perfect the compositions from the music of Evita.
It will certainly belong to the experiences of the Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In the limited number of performances, Ondrej Sokol will also jump away from the director's desktop when he comes to filming Karl Roden as President of Perón.
Further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech nationalization of the world musical Evita presents the Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondreje Sokol, the main female role originally studied Monika Absalon.
With her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and as Che Peter Strenčik.
The legendary song from Tim Rice's workshop and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts by Michael Prostejov in the live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who was involved in the first introduction in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after policemen fired rubber designs for protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police fired rubber designs in the crowd of demonstrators against the design of a new state constitution, said on Wednesday the official.
There was violence on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, states that more than 1000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they went to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber designs, known for their ability to kill, are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the Southern Nepal plant, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that they set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Another demonstration in West Nepal was also recorded by an ethnic group of Tharus, which demands the creation of its own state.
From August 10th, at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, have been killed in violent conflicts.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province — a big step towards the new constitution, but a very contentious question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week the legislators in Kathmanda voted on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials say that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After the loss on the ice of Master Litvínov, you did not manage home duel with the ice hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about the kind of catastrophic entry into the extraliga like a year ago?
I hope nothing like that happens again.

NHC predicts a 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the most recent Cape Verden islands is likely to be 60 percent in the emergence of tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, said on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low-pressure system in the middle between Cape Verden islands and the Small Antilles also has 60 percent probability in the emergence of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather prognosis with its registered office in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to pick 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) stated that it launched a campaign aimed at choosing 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states from war-off and poor countries. Each selected amount will double Google.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog published an employee named Googlu Rita Masoud based on personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
“We spent in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is becoming more and more families like this, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief would double up to $5.5 million.
Europe has been facing the greatest wave of refugees since World War II, most of which come from Syria with four years of war, which has only driven 4 million people to war this year.
Many people also flee the war of the rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mild obese diabetes surgery could be useful weight loss
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who have been provided unsurgical treatment.
"D. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to a new study of JAMA.
The weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduced hunger and limits of the human body absorb food.
During the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the surveys have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the weight relationship based on height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the overweight of the person and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital of Min-Scheng in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastro-ectomy - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who have been slightly obese.
The mean BMI among those who had undergone the operation dropped from 31 to 24.5 according to the study at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI remained those who were not given surgery treatment of diabetes, roughly the same as the value of 29.
Among surgery patients, diabetes has been resolved completely in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In a treatment group, only 1 percent of patients have been resolved for comparison of diabetes and in part only about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol has also been shown to be "presumably better in the surgical group," found authors.
The researchers also monitored the patient’ s haemoglobin level A1c in the blood, reflecting the continued blood sugar level in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from about 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
However, this value remained at about 8 percent in the treatment group.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which reflects at better levels of Haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrointestinal group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and Haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a higher probability of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While new studies do not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who had undergone the bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared with a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival between patients after surgery, Blackstone said it was a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"The work here is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, reports.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the patient's BMI decline between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to show people the severity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you gather these genetic changes that will firmly link their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the true solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near East.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugees’ home countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech when opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that under current circumstances the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also pointed out that the answer of the Western European countries, however admirable, was inadequate in this situation in the refugee crisis.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"A few thousand refugees are beautiful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring true peace and real development, especially through the training of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
When addressing the issue of violence, Dalai Lama has also expressed his statement of actions against George Bush after a terrorist attack and claims that "the violent reaction of the United States has caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way in which the problem was resolved was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have eaten the sanitary agent in the last 4 years
The toxicology center around the United States reported an increase of nearly 400 percent from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years, which swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the Director of Georgia's toxicology, the number of uses in children up to 12 years reported to the poison control centre increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of the children who must be taken to the E.R.," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink the sanitary agent deliberately while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show teens drinking sanitary due to cheap habits.
Teenages reportedly mixed sanitary products with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scent.
"The children don't think about harming them," Lopez told them.
A lot more attractive (suspension) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitary preparations with aroma strawberries, grep or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
It contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, several locations may mean alcohol poisoning.
"It is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City medical director of the toxicology control centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let the whiskey slide, either, but the people are leaving these ambulances outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently saw up to four locations of sanitary agent with aroma strawberries and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol levels were .179, which is twice the threshold of being considered to be a drunk adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who looked after her at the Guineat Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaijah spoke unresolved words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the E.R.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any sign of brain trauma because the girl fell over alcohol and hit her head, reports Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitary products from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, certain sanitary agents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after a swallowing of an sanitary agent that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Doctors thought that the product contained methole, a fatal agent, rather than ethanol, which was presented as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products across the room," according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary agents and prohibits their presence in the room.
The police assessed the dream plan as "an innocent talk," and referred to the discipline of the school neighborhood,
Fama: No consistency on Celtic team
Griffiths bagatizes the speech about failure in Celtic, while Delila admits that Hooks are in the wrong place, but he's going to turn it back.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increases his lead over Celtice by 5 points.
Penalta of the first half of ADAM Rooney’s submission provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton, Pittodria, making Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtice.
Griffiths denyes the speech of non-compliance
This situation caused gossip about non-compliance in Celtic, which was denied Griffiths, which insists that he and his fellow players do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match against Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish degree rivalry bored with the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Netherlands representatives Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry among them for the title.
De Boer, currently Ambassador to Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because there are no Rangers.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the games of the Old Company, and not only those from Scotland follow these games.
I turn things back to good, she commits herself to Dela.
ROONY Delia admitted that Celtic is a little stabbing, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent outage of the League of Masters was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and is now on top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrated, and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current event.
We're on the same page, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about the January reinforcements
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the big purchase of strength and insists he doesn't want to interfere with the unit of the Ibrox team.
Former Chief Brentford states: "The summer shift window is very different from that summer."
Players coming in this summer have an entire early season's residence period, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage arise by adding the unneeded players to the ones you really need.
Celtica Mich’s transfer target suggests retirement
Swansea Mich's attacker, who was associated with Celtice in the port window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea was completed.
The 20-year-old shooter's been having problems with the susceptible ankle for two years, and he couldn't find this summer a way out of Wales.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the closet and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neil says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths has committed to avoid Tynetastleu
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly kissed after he admitted that he sang a song with text aimed for a former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn pub in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynestle in March 2014
"It was a derby, and it was a perpetual moment," the attacker said and continued: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynetstle unless it is in Celtic dreary."
The Tannadica Council believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation through the current management of the team - but admits that the fall on the field has to end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're gonna get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
Mcannes likes to be the " ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold against Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh league victory and five-point lead before Celtice on the top of the table thanks to a penalta from the first half of Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, no matter the cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while the total unemployment of the UK rises.
The amount of 164,000 remained unchanged in Scotland for the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in UK increased by 10 000 per 1.82 million over the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate (5.5 percent), as shown by data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has decreased by 12 000 over a period of three months, the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland has decreased to 74.0 percent over the fourth quarter - which is the number above the British average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of the State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment have grown while unemployment has fallen.
Why I was witnessing execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will watch the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that this doesn't happen, I'll sit in the surveillance gallery at the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials witnessing his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When that day is coming, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to explain the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America and since there are often more requests than available places, morbid lotteryes are performed, which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen will be followed by an execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I created a special bond with him for months of calls and one two and a half hours' visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter that I compromised my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeding as he apologizes to him, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "that could formulate better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell a story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with the procedure against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, the journalist at Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure to say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would make him guilty of co-inclusive crime.
But I believe there is a great probability that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I will monitor his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love to die of unnecessary death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he drained the men from Canning River.
A man's bet from Petrhu that he would run off to the police, didn't go out after he got into shallow mud water just meters from a cop who tried to convince him to go back to shore.
Canning Vale's police were summoned on an incident crossing Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw a suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escape through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"Stat in the water and repeated I'm not going out, just come get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use a safer tactic and the police negotiations."
"Sometimes people try to do funny things running away," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins Football Champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins took a car to the ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning a biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria that last year he had tried to get a spy and threatened to end the race.
He focused on the organiser and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching of Lady Tatai while maintaining on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation with regard to Lidarin's positive tooth on cobalt that can't explain.
He's been biting his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight, and I'm gonna sleep well.
I want to go up with my head and think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking differently, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license after that.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"By the 18 months of Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after question - and offer him employment in my stables for finding out the information on things that are going on in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Does RVL grow a few balls and make sure that people outside the coach position take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe these people think they are.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm telling them right now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to a point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them, and I will carry the burden on them to make decisions.
I have my family's support, and I can leave.
The frustrates of the coach increased with long-term investigation due to cobalt, including the Lidari, and recent scratches in it would make him feel that "he would have the hours of his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the invincible Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race as "measuring" after the clay cover or mud was applied to the legs, which is against the rules.
It's against racing rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the race day.
The Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of cover on the day of the race to which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who ran away was arrested
The police arrested the man who hit the cyclist on the weekend in Cobram and left after the collision.
The cyclist was air transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns a punch to rivals for a wrestler's claim.
Craig Bellamy, Coach Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' actions as "planning" two NRLs of Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the referee allowed Storm's players to "wrest" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the final qualifications in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly turmated remark on the Strorm after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "the tour" of the rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" for a Wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' actions and said they were focusing on contact during them.
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two leaders, which could mean that they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about fighting when they beat us 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last year, we just put emphasis on contact during the procedure, which meant a turnover for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things always come in this season.
Bellamy underestimated Bennet's idea of "warming football" and reminded his mentor that Bentov's team, St George-Illawarra Dragons, won the 2010 Prime Ministership by playing "no" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about being his Saturday game as exciting as ours," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of a game that seems to him to be disturbing, especially his young backers with their speed.
You'd like to play such football if you had this type of players available.
He said this opinion in 2010, and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play this style.
It raises more self-confidence in me because they say such things because they are concerned about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the game Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the fight Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not making experiments interesting?
I think these are agendas.
If they mention us, that means we will meet again at the stage.
Storm has a break this weekend and they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man got $200 000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine, who was smuggled out of Queensland, got a deposit of 200,000 dollars.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men who was arrested last month by federal police investigating 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from southern America through Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting together with the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential judgment of life for the use of commercial cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovice built a defense of the fact that there is no evidence of the fact that he owns all the amount and that he could be in a coffee shop entirely and innocent.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought that Maksimovic would flee.
He's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice have jointly offered a bail of USD 200 000 for his release.
"After reading both statements, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were clearly insufficient because the accused did not come forward in court, warned.
Maksimovice was given bail on condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passports, report daily to the police and observes the ban from 18 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the phone girl to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophil used the 11-year-old call to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone girl when she was sleeping, then applied to her online chat, where he had lots of dirty photos of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and found it in Hogg's hand.
She went through it, and before she notified her mother, she found some disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "social" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "wrote pedophiles" on the Internet before he "predicted that they were a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sherlock Court: "He said it was addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was running a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend that he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he did it to lure them in.
He claims he'd gone drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When a girl found reports on her phone, he called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone and then the defendant was confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted to an action in respect of the acceptance or disclosure of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, broke the terms of bail on 25 January and did not come to a hearing at the Court on 24 March this year.
The lawyer Gregor Sim requested Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he can argue that there was no "no essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael sentenced the sentence to October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but he was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Mr Mugabe, a bad speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the African oldest leader, had already fallen on the stairs leading to the stage this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became virtual in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also deposed by the claims of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats to the killing, which warned them against Mr. Mugabe’s discharge during his speech.
Last month, they turned him off and provoked him during his speech about the state of the nation in Parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
President of the MPC for democratic change (MCC), Incent Gones, said that seven opposition policies adopted by text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that will not appear, but it is named "Death," told the journalist after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that their immunity ends in Parliament and once they are out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party is holding "funds" on threats to Members.
Hewlett-Packard is preparing to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard repeals 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of its efforts to restructuring and save the company’s business services.
HP will be divided into two stocked companies later this year and separate computer and printer stores from its faster corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of around $2.7 billion and it will start in the fourth quarter, stated in HP’s statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and Chairman of the Board, which will be the head of the team after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more sophisticated than the HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses to move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the emerging requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual statement of receipt of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing uncompetitive integrated technological solutions" by the company.
The company, which was founded in 1930 by the University of Stanford Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was named "Silicon Valley Centre."
HP went through massive reorganizations to handle the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP, the second largest manufacturer of PC and one of America's largest technical companies, is the latest of this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says the teammates must get to the wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it was still September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him not to play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, its involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great damage to this latest problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strong after the ankle injury, and then he got back into the former form during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten careers," said Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It didn't concern his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation conducted by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he played only 65 league games in Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two clubs of the Premier League who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Always, when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a contest", says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in Lize Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to re-run his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to come.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monrealo Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and leave the players who need it to breathe, ” says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F group procedure, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stage in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season's campaign was maintained.
The stadium was shaking about Wednesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 Richter.
That was this year in Zagreb already given.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from the past season of Champion League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," said Wenger.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar views in different shows is beating in the eyes, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide between young men under 15 years.
In 2013 it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to deal with this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men to seek assistance if necessary.
In the heart of this fight there is a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing signs of depression found that if the damaged had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, it represents a circle of mentally sound friends half a chance for the occurrence of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be reachable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of communication, immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, although in reality we are more isolated.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as a millionaire recently explained and a player of games, money doesn't really buy better luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but their personalities, which lighted through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, time to watch football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the laundering from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings for themselves.
as a Samaritan worker explained to me, "my role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicides really confirmed to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the programs that will rise up in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the state of outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a larger close, network of friends and family.
So if you are planning this weekend at the FrendsFest organized by the Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends out for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what difference your friendship can do.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to build the Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinburgh Cavani after shooting a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in the Lize Masters and helped PSG on Tuesday defeat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the game report and the game response.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani both scored on Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Lize Masters with a final comfortable 2-0 win against Malma on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in Lize Masters and this PSG player sent the French champions for victory, but then dropped several chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore, the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not focused only on qualifying for elimination wheels, but on improving their journeys to the quarter finals recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic before the goal of the protagonist and was later trained against his home team and club in which he started his famous career in 1999.
"In Lize Masters, it's not easy to win outside or home, so win 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we have to improve with the process of season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot for one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes of the PSG team, which at home spent this weekend the 2-2 remuse with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was under Di Mario in the fourth minute.
Argentinian wing was marked as a man who shifts PSG to a new level in Europe after a crossing from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why when he ran into Marc Verratti's pass behind Malma's defense and sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a grand PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in play-off and got into this stage, joined with 9 internals in the base lineup and five defenders and two pulled backs were a tough opponent.
But besides Nikola Djurdjika's missile, which just missed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves was concerned about the benefits of the attack by bad receptions and the miserable ending, which was neither good nor by Ibrahim, which could not fire five times in the first half, and was later disappointed because his missile arrived on the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved to be much more appropriate when he came to prepare the chances for his teammates, and it was just his addition, when Di Maria sent a shooting shot that ended in the Wind goal for 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan warhead sent the sixth goal of this season behind the line after the play from Maxwell's left wing.
This ended all of Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make something out of the fight, and only the excellent save of the Wildan from the great proximity was the hope of David Luize and the score remained unchanged even at the time when the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide has admitted that PSG was a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in Lize Masters took place last December."
Since then, we've only played Swedish league, which isn't exactly the same.
Qualification games aren't enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing fight for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion for selling shares
Glencore mining giant based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in her statement that she sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off her debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is faced with a reduction in commodity prices, as China’s slowdown in the economy reduces demand and warms the spark of destruction across the markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore stock prices to the top on the London stock market in early morning shops.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of a wider plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which was collected by about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123pence for the share, which meant 2,4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1.3 billion shares were removed in the total price of 9.99 percent for the group.
Concerns regarding the extension of Chinese growth were reduced by nearly half-and-a-carbon iron ore, copper and other commodities decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi in Washington will take place in Washington on 25 September in response to Barack Obama for a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, reported a report.
American President and First Lady Michelle Obama are inviting President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks.
"The visit of President Xi represents an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and calls for cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the non-conformities of both states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several technical leaders in the United States on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the United Nations September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve disputed problems, including Washington's concerns from the alleged Chinese cyber-surgeons and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency light-burned German was far from being a European crew, but already forced the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal with the problem of refugees: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters into an old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing about the future allocation of refugees according to quotas on the basis of the amount that is increasing in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 out of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 000 refugees, ministers at home to the Member States have changed their priority.
Before looking after the final destination of the runners, first of all, it is necessary to filter those who come today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for the management of migration," stressed the text of the ministers discussed on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis, the EU's common currency has found it at risk of its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its decision and increases its pressure.
It renews border checks, especially with Austria, but without blocking the inflow of those seeking asylum in this country.
This makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
It has already served as proof that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France also consider this, even though with a variety of intensity.
Hungary has come to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under Schengen rules.
That it's a dominance effect, but it sees blind as well.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy, as well as in Hungary for those who have already passed into the inland.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière acted intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is made of weight.
In Italy, non-official statistics have already been registered and identified with fingerprint removals of two thirds of newcomers.
The Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because they fear more than others, so that the camps in which refugees would gather on her account remain on her lairs.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as far as it has arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge walling hole.
Athens, which are still in financial dissolution and waiting for a new government, put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and the source of now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce control points as soon as possible, but it did not provide any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe" agreed on Monday by EU Interior Ministers on the mobilization of this front.
This is therefore the case in this country with the intervention teams of the European Agency for the control of the Frontex border.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of islands.
"The need for adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
In terms of law, the last words of Athens will continue.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-olds has pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which had already been established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
Number, but not obligation, was maintained in a text approved by a majority of eight-year-olds on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only strong promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already reached an agreement in June during the EU's Hectic Summit, will be concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists that killed the avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived the eight - year - old group as one.
Previous media reports indicate it's about Poland.
A 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with severe leg injury in the area of femoral femoral bone.
The dead were mostly 40 according to AFP.
"The rescue action ended, also the bodies of the victim were transported to Briancon," explained the Prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The disaster happened around noon in Pelvoux mountain area under the peak of Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain range 4015 metres.
"The new avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a foot high," noted the head of Nicolas Colombani rescuers.
At an eight-member group, according to him about 3900 metres high, there was a huge amount of snow.
The weather was not in the area today.
Treadful before the game with Brago: Finally, the true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trštovský, in his Cup premiere, managed to go through the front of the European League to a basic group with football players, and now he is pleased to enjoy the right Europe with the team.
Sloven to launch the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Brag and according to coach wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in an extortion fear, when every goal and every situation could have eliminated you on your way to a dream group, now we're there and we're playing six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about each of the included goals, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a double.
"I look forward to it, and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," Treštovský said at the press conference.
Bragu considers it a top team.
It will be very active, have the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good for the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult to say that he does not have a name, but he has three goals in his cab.
"It's a great whole of top team level," said Tristovský.
But Brag doesn't consider it obvious.
I take it we're playing at home, so I'm sure we're not the outsiders.
"I think we have also shown in our home competitions in pre-schools that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach whose team lost eleven duels this season just the opening Super Pohár in Pilsen.
They believe that Liberec can force Braz to style.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is unconventional for them to be disciplined.
They play 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"He's a very heavy opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," Trustovský said.
We studied a lot of opponents in the preschools, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to training.
"And we definitely want, although it's going to be very difficult to play according to our nots," he added a coach.
Student films will be controlled by Písek, starting with an international festival.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries reported their works this year to the 15th edition of the International Film Festival in Písek.
Four decades of them, which the commission of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be discussed from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will select an international jury, said the spokesman of the Jakub Charvat festival.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which is derived from festival sounds.
She's a detective this year.
This year's director Richard Blumenfeld is planning to combine the elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we also need to solve the crime that was committed in our socket this year," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting one from student production - films played, animated and documentary.
It will evaluate them as an international jury, including the winner of the previous year, the director Miklas Mannek, the Spanish director Claudio Niubo and the British producer Hemant Shard.
The festival organizers are preparing an accompanying program every year.
Will Wattian Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player for Didgeridoo Ondrej Smeykal, turbošanson group fly?, playful band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be the graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards between which neither does the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition nears the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The film "The Cameraman" will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the song parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of Jan Novotný would baptize his new book by the new book of 3 friends from the town of P.
This year we also remind you of Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of the FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"The young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint links with film crafts," said the spokesperson.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, take several job auditions at once and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of private higher professional film schools in Písek.
Her founders, Vladimir and Miloň Terč, organized their first year in 1997.
Until the sixth year he was held once every two years.
In the event of a bankruptcy, the insurance companies are to pay the claims of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
She decided to do it in the middle of the House when she approved the modified amendment of the Act on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy by bank guarantee, according to a forecast which aims to assess to the Senate.
Insurance undertakings with an obligation to pay client's claims and the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on adaptations, claims consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to insurance for travel agencies against the crash if the amendment is to be paid.
The proposal, however, criticises travel agents.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocommunic.
It noted this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be realistic," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee according to him won't work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The proxy offices will have to end their activities or move abroad," warned Kalousek.
Member of the Presidency of the Association of Czech Travel agencies and Tomio Okamura (SPD) agencies with Kalousk concerns on the basis of a survey between the Member States of the CC.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The expression of the insurance company does not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written statement in that sense.
They're trying to find out that travel agencies are going to participate, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned Jan Fischer (ODS), who referred to the position of the competitive Association of Travel agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Travel agencies according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her motion for the release of the contested passage was not approved by the House.
Neither Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) entered the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Mr Filip warned of travel agencies that he thought could threaten the consumer.
The rapporteur of Martin Berdych (ANO) submitted a proposal to limit the liability of the insurance undertakings in cases where they could not know that insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not be the originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for travel agents offering tours by air, and a million limit for the selling office, for example, bus tours.
The border stays at 30 percent of planned tragedies from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance performance will have to be such that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the travel agency will cover all customer claims.
Norm and after the adjustments provide that travel agencies will have to introduce on the routes sold which travel agency organizes the tour.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of a contract, inter alia, of economic data and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Committee on Public Administration shall also include further regular information on insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to supply them with data on the number of passengers and trips sold, the total price of the trips sold and the amount of the advance and the losses for the tours and the vouchers for them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that a travel agency has not complied with any of its legal obligations to an insurance undertaking, it shall invite it to remedy or be able to prohibit new contracts in the event that the breach of an obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customers.
Novela also has new adjustments to the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of subsidies to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a view of the next two years.
According to the Association of the President of the law, he didn't think what would happen if the insurance company broke out the contract.
It won't be allowed to organize tours, and the clients who bought the tour prior to the termination of the insurance will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CC will suffer a significant loss and may also fail, even though its management was in good condition.
One way that travel agents can deal with such situations will be to sue the State for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will only act on our market as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Association of Jan Papež.
Although the proposal for amendment also includes the bank guarantee institution, it is so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice at all because the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in existing practice is unnecessary.
In the period of two years, the entire EU legislation will need to be reworked in view of the new EU directive.
In the Czech market, a total of 942 active insured travel agencies are currently operating.
Only three CCs ended their activities this year.
National travel agencies will sell tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion each year.
Merkel: We must improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be betting on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced it after meeting German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the eight-year-olds Member States.
We need to help countries where refugees are leaving or when they are detained after their country has been abandoned.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are applying for decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could be increased financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The Federal countries also support the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on the European countries," Merkel further stated.
Mr Braniborska Dietmar Woidke, in this connection at the press conference, said that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of EU runners on the basis of quotas has long been rejected, among other things, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also made their way to speed up asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Braiborian Prime Minister.
According to him, most of the money that Germany is spending to care for cross-borders is also needed to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed to help refugees handle German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners are able to integrate, they can be of great benefit to us, he said.

The Tigers just turned away their defeat when they beat Minessot with a tight score of 5-4 at the Target Field stadium on Tuesday.
The twins wasted their chance to approach Houston Astros and capture the second wild card in the American League.

"It's hard to get into a fight when you're often sitting on a bench and that's why I want to get into the game."
Victor Martinez was hit three times, and he made two hangs and his first brave spot since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game of June that hit four times in the game against Seattle Mariners.
“He leaned well into it,” Ausmus said.

“I certainly did not imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift I felt that I was doing better.”
After resisting the first shift, Hughes released one point of the second indicator of Ian Kinsler.
Two leavings for the right field of J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.

However, he hasn't played for a loaded muscle since August 20.

Xi Calls for opening the economy into the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping of the group, whose task is Tuesday's management reform.
"The Chinese should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policy," said the Group's 16th meeting in order to deepen the overall reform.
Promotion of opening up during the born reforms will provide new impetus and vitality, also providing new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches, the release of border control policies, State aid (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration residence system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises outside investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through the test programmes.
This step is important as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, stating the statement.
The government will also release control over the powers it delegates to companies and will make sure companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
It also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for supporting regional growth.
In an attempt to open up a State-controlled sector, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and protect the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide better services," says the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or for a "green card", thanks to the optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practice and developing a professional judge and the prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to the statement issued after the meeting.
New beds may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region of Jakub Gjek (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are possibilities for extending care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department, centres of one day surgery could be created, where, according to the established concept, the performance of surgical fields that do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.
In which particular hospitals should be targeted at day-to-day surgery, it is not yet clear.
A laser centre with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin diseases could be created at the skin department of Karlovy Vary.
The concept also recommended the development of apalic centers, which would take care of patients with disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such a facility to the hospital Island, where similar care exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the subsequent care beds, especially the LDN, whose capacity is insufficient and should be closely connected to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as a bed of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN beds, recommend the concept.
As he points out, after-care beds are missing mainly in Karlovy Vary hospital.
There you can use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, socio-health cots are not involved in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are lacking in the whole Republic, so it could serve for other countries as the so-called Alzheimer’scentrum.
Hospitals should be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called binding beds, to which European subsidies will be released.
"This is a bed that will be connected to the fields of the specialized care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
