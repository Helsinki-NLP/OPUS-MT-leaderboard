Strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-elect
Republican leaders have justified their policy of necessity to fight against electoral fraud.
Brennonovo Centre, however, refers to such fraud as myth, with the fact that electoral fraud in the United States is less frequent than the number of people who will die after lightning hit.
In the last ten years only 300 electoral fraud cases have been recorded by Republican lawyers.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the US, individual states have responsibility for the organization of federal elections.
And in this spirit, most US governments have been launching new laws since 2009 that make the election process more difficult or writing into the electoral list.
This phenomenon recorded a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives came in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting electoral law in 41 states were submitted for 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American nationality.
In addition, these laws limit the term for elections in advance, impose the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the elections, and reject the right of election to citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, no American state required the voters to present a proof of identity with photographs.
The first state that introduced this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other countries.
In the last two years, the proposals for such laws in 34 countries have been supported in order to force voters to present their photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age, who are allowed to vote, no photo ID issued by their government.
In addition, there are about five million new voters in 2012.
The purchase of the required identity card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately touched mainly by young, minority members and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% of people under 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 have no photo identification required.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their tendency to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their photo ID card exposed to their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow the members of the hunting or fishing clubs who prefer the Republican candidates, the cards exposed to these clubs to be used.
By 2004, no State required a proof of citizenship at the elections.
The first such request was put in place by Arizona.
Since 2011, some 12 countries have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures tend to reduce the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is necessary to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic side.
The Republican legislation in 2011 supported laws in eight countries which disturb the registration of voters on the day of elections.
In addition, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
During the 2004 general elections, for example, the campaign to register the voters for about 10 million inhabitants.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws in the other five countries aimed at shortening the election period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, the African-Americans formed 33% of the voters who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They created only 11% of all the voters, but 24% of the people who voted in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all the voters, were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the approval of the laws that limit the registration of voters.
Democrat governors blocked several bill designs with their vest.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, he even hit the U.S. Attorney General.
They partly managed to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced completely burden the voting right in 2012.
Democrat critics speak in particular of the prejudice of approved laws and consider them a clear effort to influence the results of elections in 2012 in key countries.
The 2011 Centre's report shows that the countries where these laws have been approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the electoral congregation necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: whether or not to have an exam?
The PSA test brought the wrong results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical surgery.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have already been so mad at examination at all.
To be tested or not?
We asked for an opinion of two experts.
In the US studies, there was a high level of contamination between individual test groups, which is why it is difficult to interpret these results and to deliver valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, noted a different mortality rate between patients undergoing examination and those who did not go to them.
These studies also showed a 12-year interval that those who fail to investigate had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
I therefore recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also more dangerous.
The key is to take the right decision as soon as cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are impenetrable.
It is therefore necessary to explain properly to the patient the degree of danger of his cancer, to offer him alternatives, not necessarily cure prostate cancer which has no impact on life in the long term and, in these cases, rather on active monitoring of the disease.
Today, a number of men with cancer diagnosed are not treated as their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them in life.
We will propose them to carry out active surveillance and offer them treatment if disease progression is possible.
More often and with greater accuracy, we define criteria that help to decide which type to heal and which not.
Still, I suggest you pass the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with your doctor and to determine whether or not it is appropriate to undergo an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems the best means to reduce the risk of disease adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthyly and moves sufficiently, it would be possible to avoid up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson of Canadian cancer research companies.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by hereditary.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For a Canadian cancer research company, it remains a priority to fight against smoking, even if the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," spokesman André Beaulie.
Encouraging: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death on cancer is halved.
Weight
Pregnancy and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease according to SCC.
It increases the risk of breast cancer, large intestine, and pericardial, esophagus, pancreas and stems.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," reports.
Food
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high a consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the victims for which the same applies.
The storage of meat by drying, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," reports.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet reached a clear conclusion.
A vitamin E study is contrary to the SCC.
Although the risk of prostate cancer is reduced according to one of these studies, another study talks about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his fears and precedents in the family with his doctor.
"Doing an exam doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs Boson examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson caused a legitimate start last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no absolute certainty among physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a whole new particle available, which is very similar to Higgs' boson, as foretold by the standard model.
The new data published this week during a major physical congress in Kyoto confirm it rather, but there is still no data available so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, suppose it's Higgs' boson, as the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what this is really about.
In this world, a completely unquestionable law applies, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can't be circumvented - and don't try too hard, or else you'll hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that there is a similar law in it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot handle the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quant state" - this "stable" is roughly creating some of their properties.
They also divide physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or pheromones, who obey Pauli's principle obediently.
And on the other hand, there are bosons, underground anarchists who don't appreciate anything - certainly not this principle, which means they can still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (the absolutely amazing car), which is the The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley labs: the mesons that we leave here without notice, and the "power particles" that spread large natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals as possible to believe.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "light particles", which is the "broader" of electromagnetic force.
Because when particles with an electric charge accelerates or changes their direction, "disengages" by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, as well as the pebble thrown into the pond.
From this "interference" there is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power bearers".
A more stable field
It's also with Higgs' boson, only with the difference that "off" needs to be a different field, Higgs' field to show up.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like the frozen pond's level, it is now only a very large boulevard.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part acceleration as an accelerant in the CERN lab - a large raging compresser with a high chain is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - so that energy can be developed.
The analogies with electromagnetic field are once again suitable for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With electromagnetic fields, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold apart on the fridge.
And equally, with Higgs’ fields, they do not react to all particles: those who do so have a certain matter, while others (such as photons, let us look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks what all these researches are for, what do they bring us?
In terms of science, the validity of the standard model (SM) is confirmed, which allows the physicists to undergo examination of any non-conformity between the observations and forecasts of SM.
Moreover, few physicists literally wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and mark some gaps in the model.
It must be noted that the model has so far huge shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ha!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (beyond out!).
CERN, however, has not shown such a problem until now.
Responses
The responses to this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Nováková can only be expected very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no one.
Consider: At the very beginning of the 1960 ’ s, laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would cause.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Phyzik Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (premier rays were pulsive) in 1962, I already said it - the laser was initially considered to be such a "game to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may also come out of all the tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan it at all, now serves as a "around" of all digital cameras in the world and took the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that action around LHC really needs to change our lives, but it means that you never know...
Palliative Care - The best way to get out of life... ▶ Le Devoir
Through his Commission for Genuine Death, Quebek recently joined the delicate questions regarding the rest of his life.
The debate should be continued shortly and at the same time a draft of the law is being proposed.
In this crucial area, there is still a lot of work left to do.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already been seven," says he without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived last day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," she adds.
The disease has done its work: A great weakness prevents him from taking away alone in the toilet or eating alone.
He looks rustically looking at a delicious looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to the unsubs who stop at him, bringing him drugs, offering him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the truce, it humiliates me," he tells me.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In life you learn that men urinate," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"depends on the ability of which man" says the psychologist if he accepts the return.
In view of the many people engaged in palliative care, key moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter home with the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
Their prognosis is up to three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide them with the so-called "pure" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die "on suffocation in full consciousness".
The disease, however, allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," he says, and then they choose us to put her on a breathing device.
Yet, he is still looking forward to visiting his son from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body with the help of nutrition.
So it looks like a palliative care that comes in unless there's anything else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one single bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die someday.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one doctor at home.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, it can be given, for example, a den of brandy or peppers, according to the taste.
Diabetics no longer need to keep an eye on their sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They took Mr X's beer last night, who died later last night.
He'll finish his son's beer this morning in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as much as their loved ones," said Nathalie Saviard, director of care service.
Victor-Gadbois' home goes one day after another, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a three-year-old man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly based on pillows, while they drink to his honor, he dies tragically six-year-old man surrounded by his parents, a woman and two little children after he tried all the possibilities to survive.
"There are always three to five beds, which are intended for cancer individuals up to 45 years old," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois are coming from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is intended to ease suffering as soon as the sick will reach the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the Company for home palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients.
And precisely this fundamental inability of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care are concerned with the adoption of the euthanasia Act and assisted suicide.
From October onwards, the manifest is signed with tips in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they disagree with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, thequebical health system is not sufficiently effective to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care before it can be agreed to perform euthanasia.
As she says, she has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days on an emergency in huge pains without taking the necessary steps to ease her feelings.
It is fearful that patients do not seek death because they do not receive appropriate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients up to the last few moments regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already completely minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was done with treatment, she replied that she felt sorry for me to stop fighting, she was telling us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die are grateful to their physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when their palliative sand team eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is not definitely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Company for home palliative care of Grand Montréal, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which will sleep the patient until the end, whether accidentally or whether sedate is administered permanently.
We can't face that we don't see this part of suffering.
A patient who can't get rid of the pain will have an ever greater chance of accessing palliative sedators.
The sick people who have not been given seditative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," which means "I want you to get rid of my pain".
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health.
Extensive Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of road management, business in construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties and experts in the Italian mafia are constantly telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mobs hang out.
This "bor" came the Quebeck tax taxpayers very expensive, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been crushed since we've taken essential measures," says the ironically Jacques Duchesneau, aquebtic MP and former police chief in Montreal.
He made a scandal in 2011 based on a consistent investigation aimed at embezzling the funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which then liberalquebecký Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, transparent financing of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport saved billions of dollars on orders," when some people held their instincts to gain their share of them!
Charbonneau's commission, "has brought two mayors to the demise," adds with the hope that she will manage to " unravel some people's leprosy".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To that end, the "Marteau types" officers have made sure that the montreal moneycard significantly reduces inflatable contracts from 2009 onwards...
Over the past few weeks, they have performed a number of inspections and accused of fraud and corruption of numerous municipal representatives such as Frank Zamino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one municipality from the suburbs.
The next list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his function as mayor of Laval, the third largestquebeck city.
It is suspected that he repeatedly accepted fees in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito has created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He gave himself 3% of the value of the contracts he acquired in Montréal to the mediator associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal, for which he was running the Mayor of Gérald Tremblay.
After 2000, he was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (around EUR 68 000) to the provinces, but especially to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also admitted that he organized illegal financing for the former liberal vice-president of Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money
In Montreal, "system" of corruption worked very badly.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described very detailed in front of the commission: Within ten years he received gifts from the construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and allowance worth a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with money, in which he was above the price.
The other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their fees for 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through false multipliers.
The mayor of Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of holding his eyes close to the contemporary budget that brought dirty money into his purse.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, thereby imposing Montréal into a vast crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island since 2010, he has been planting against the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly to the middle of a flourishing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About an investigation that will finally be launched, he says that "he's pulling strings in order to understand the functioning of the system of seam antlers to stop the gangrene and to catch the guilty."
She thinks the trial's "serious, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these doubtful practices cannot return.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned with the roles of "intelligible Members of this lsti", if they have not gotten caught up in these messes!
It's estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québek comes from dirty money, and irony adds, "I hear it's just a weak reflection of reality."
The Quebeck government proposes to limit the donations to 100 dollars, but it doesn't think he's going to solve the situation: "Until the election expenses are strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It suggests a comprehensive control of the public procurement and funding system of the parties: "We can no longer fall; if we focus on the essence of the matter, we can build again on tighter foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story has taken the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, the Spirit recommends to everyone who laughs at him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG isn't FC Barcelona!"
In this season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I get close to them.
The technical team has helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier at the game.
Everything's going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparations at INF Clairefontaine until transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always shifted to individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has put in place...
Forces from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a bigger taste for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of money in connection with my position.
My assistants like Claude Makelele, who played on the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league, and he is one of the best European trainers.
He's had a lot of experience with top teams.
He worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust that he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead position.
But we're stuck in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have made it very easily to the eighth finals.
What's your club got in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of European teams.
First, we want to win our qualifying group in front of Port so we can play the eight-final home.
Can PSG become a large European club in the short term?
The budget's already on it...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, he has to win titles and write into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this intention possible.
And would it be a huge failure not to win in the 1st league as last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've missed enough last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a bright master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it'll work out this year.
Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have weapons available to beat them.
Do you think the PSG media expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and what our players have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troys 4:0 at home, and there's still something that's still going on in the paper, it's not very nice.
You ask what people might want more from you.
Of course, it is not possible to win 4:0 at every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build the team.
In Liz's masters, we proved we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought in the second season in eight, and they've also invested large amounts!
Given the invested sums, you might expect to have a head start before the other 15 points!
That insults the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which failed too much last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing 1. League is.
I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have succeeded.
It seems as if PSG relyed on Zlatan Ibrahimovič's performances in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's "dependence on Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahimevich is very powerful and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and shows that he's the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team we respect both the player and the players.
Even he respects the people he's got around him.
What he's achieved is really special.
This led others to increasing their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with a French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also manage to play good games in the representation.
And in that I was hoping for from my admission to the representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to ourselves to be exemplary in our performance.
How are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
He's got results.
We're in a good place to qualify in MS.
Coach picks hard, he's around the players, and he's able to overwhelm for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This fight gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before that shock in Spain, I've never had such a fight for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without a bank
All the negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the founder of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonym), represents both virtual money (translatable to dollars, EUR...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About 1,000 websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course of Bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it is on the border of about $10 (the view of courses is shown on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Compared with the world's real money or financial products, that's not impressive.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money", "consuming dollar and euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for a process in a video game that you get by a game or who can buy (and then change back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are depositors of the books of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic email addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double key encryption system.
The network may therefore verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file it is possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in writing this new transaction into this book.
It is going through the resolution of the mathematical task given to the computers concerned, whose investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the process of cutting the file; i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "scale".
The aim is to find a number that provides a specific print (at least zero in the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then be clearly displayed connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would be made to the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
But the number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into a hundred million, so the space for the march is...
The burden of the task also increases with an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the saved bitcoins have been removed.
"The used crack does not apply to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for payments by real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also true for cash.
Important players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this character.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of Weizman's Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of common accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not gain.
In November, "brown discounts" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching books on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or without contact with his phone, but he uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that are cheaper because of this.
In addition, the bearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders where new terminals or software is not needed.
Just communicate the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general move towards questioning hierarchical systems and moving to more horizontal systems.
"As Bitcoin stands out, it will take a while, but 2013 might be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB expects the re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surob).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and make the Afghans choose their own future and expect everything from us.
The greatest harm has been suffered by people in the Afghan countryside that we have punished since we considered them terrorists.
And so have we, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those injuries and mutilation.
Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often rurals who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if the jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tajik.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The exit of the French units from the foundation of Niirab, which I followed from the peaks of the mountains planted with mandanese thanks to the French loans, took place in order.
The truck and armored vehicles have arrived in Kabul without attacking the air escort helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was empty at that time, and the country was in the blood and fire due to the fights between the various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control over the country was then considered to be a kind of exemption, a return to safety.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these countrysides, which was completely controlled by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The Afghan Government and the present Taliban agree in an attempt to maintain women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They were made of them, made up of state land, which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American subcontractors.
They have discredited themselves; most of them have never been in combat.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people long for a government that they won't create thieves.
A number of young people want to leave just as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity are: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and its related ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, modern worlds have come to know and its advantages have become interesting.
About 65% of the population is less than 25 years old; currently 5 million people live in Kabul, five to five of the total population.
The cities are full of state schools, girls and boys go there.
These youths will have to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darking of former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand up to her forehead be considered legitimate?
Some Soviet military commanders are already restoring provincial miles that will be beyond central control.
Afghanistan, a horny country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation following the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that there has been a cancellation of the Prime Minister's post, which has existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
The President of Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been strongly dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has managed to recover, no dam is working, no major watering system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, just fruit and vegetables.
The priority is private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Word has spread out that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And it just made you feel that the western states were here just to take it.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot and without means to transport raw materials through the mountains, but no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the mine on the copper of Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The exit of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys’ lycea, French cathedrals at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 the initiative "strange the heart and soul" was designed to bring together aid and military activities, in which the "civil-arms" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) was established, which was abolished in 2012, but was achieved by countless French NGOs in a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to dampen the rebellion: irrigating, wells, drinking water, foresting, fruit trees, soil protection and the spread of burgeonable areas.
What memory do we keep after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order for these farmers to free themselves from the rebellion led by foreign groups, they wish to achieve small civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touched directly by them.
Hard work at the Egyptian Institute
President Muhammad Mursi has gone to another game of poker.
While Egypt remains most divided in its history due to the publication of a constitution which temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly would now approve the final text.
Before a week ago, the Head of State granted the assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a temporary text, which has been added many times, which weakens the country’s constitutional stability and leads to legal impressions.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's dissolution.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President continues in his "autocrat delire", to continue to "interrupt his word" and "bringing the law".
However, its supporters ensure that it is the means to turn as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time to make the Brotherhood withdraw from the intention of text to the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to achieve national and democratic legitimacy again, while the entire countries reject protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the American weekly, Time, Muhammad Mursie seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this swiftly organised vote builds up the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Be approved by my text, or I will keep unlimited powers" which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitutions.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the mentioned constitutional assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists.
Most liberals were missing in the vote.
In the middle of November, not long before the publication of the constitution, they banged the door with the fact that they did not have the opportunity to make their views known.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities, have imitated their step.
In order to achieve its capacity, 11 alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to Muslim Brotherhood.
It does not surprise, however, that articles of the Constitution have often been unanimityd.
The commentators continued to stand over the fact that one of the few disputes took place that day around... the hours for prayer when some of the committee members held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly sorted.
The text of the vote last night consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, Article 2, is ultimately consistent with the version of the 1971 Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the main sources of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term 'administrative', which would allow more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been repaired represents a sign of their good will and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
The "Secrets" are against liberals who see only a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar to a advisory role, in particular for matters of law compliance with Sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons allowed to express are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It is possible to see the beginnings of theocracy."
The fear of liberals is even more exterminated by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the existing one.
"For the time being, there has not been any particular religious consequences.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not street workers, but university workers have studied a number of them in French schools," the mild concern Alexis Bluet, who prepares work on a constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "may there be a dispute regarding the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, note red.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to express themselves."
In addition to religious pages, the text approved yesterday is very critical because of the widespread powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been significant restrictions against the former regime.
Other disputed place: powers conferred on the military.
In line with the wishes of the military officials, the verification of the budget for defence will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Board.
Furthermore, in the military courts, the proceedings with civilians will not be prohibited, as the association for human rights has requested.
These associations are talking about their doubts in relation to the text that they consider against freedom.
The feisty act is maintained and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayefová from the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to her, the only positive point is the ban on torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to perform in television last night, there are demonstrations scheduled for this afternoon.
The state leaders will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, pup of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The promised earth combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and indifference of nature.
AaF identified five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Beneve yourself to holy places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
They claim that all those who enter this "valet" will come down to God’s mercy.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus ’ miracles: transforming the water into wine at the wedding, walking through the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will pass through the path of pain or Jesus ’ Cross Way (Via Doloros Latin).
He begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, walking through the streets of the Old Town and leading to the Temple of God's grave on the Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of the anointed and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian pup of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where according to Christian legends the tree grew, from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Baptizers, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes that will then be completed.
Business the way to the vertical
The ruin of the fortress Masada remained of secret hiding from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruins are located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
With their own powers, only those who deal with mountaineering can get to it.
The others on this historic mountain will bring cable.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, who is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists from the foothill of the shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they lived on the top of the mountain of pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, certainly worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parlament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of Judah, and further about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exhibits there are widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In the Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which is represented by several rooms of ancient Turkish spa with figures of users of spa and spa nurses from that time.
It is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
Fifth Museum - The Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - talks about one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the monument of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step in and you'll be in total darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also introduced.
Improving my health
The three major spa centres of Israel are spread over the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bathe in winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsia and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people are bathed for a year.
The dead sea is, by the way, the most unusual sea in the world, located at the lowest point of land of the planet - at level 417 m below sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution, which is easy to maintain at the level and people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with saltwater - brine, and the healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, airway inflammation, diabetes to cure the turbulent nerves.
Touch the mystery ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was a famous seaway connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The references of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it's where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived long and happy life together.
Indeed, the Tourists love the toads of the narrow streets, named after the signs of truth.
They say that if you stick to the walls of the alley, the sign of yours, the happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet the newlyweds who come here from all Israel and even from other lands to take pictures.
And in Caesarai - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theatre and "to get" the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesareare was the capital city of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
It is better to take the money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for ekes (now the dollar is about $3.8 of ekel).
The city transport is mainly bus transport, but in Jerusalem it drives a speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower town with the upper one.
It's essentially the underground rope track.
Traveling all kinds of public transport costs 6 seats for which you can travel 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath celebrates on Saturday.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, he ceases to work at markets, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish with no ham and meals, which contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish lobster mash, various types of sauces, milkballs - wafers, fruit and vegetables.
There are no toulous dogs on the streets of Israel.
There are a lot of fed cats, who are actingly "dulging according to their taste".
In the evening you can see how they sleep on the roofs of parked cars.
Pregnant cats love people-like places and with taste they're letting go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And I'm gonna borrow my bike, it's gonna cost about 15 grand a day.
The museum tickets cost on average 30 jaws.
Numbers expressed
Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world in 2012.
To recognize the country and rest most of the citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine have arrived.
The promised land visited from January to October 2012 at 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and the Powerful" then announced to Moscow: The immigrants save money on their tongue
While human rights defenders and human rights defenders are still discussing the law on compulsory language tests, there are already frauds in the country who sell "worked" certificates.
There are 13 million foreign workers coming to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are middle Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to take a test from the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors in time.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the basis of law.
Knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed to obtain and extend the working permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of the country where the Russian language is the official language.
This law is not followed by people who have successfully achieved the approval and have obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the aegis of Pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship between the nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already opened in Russia today.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was supported by members of state pride and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law entered into force, they have proven to protect human rights many times in the press the question: and what will actually bring this?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of migration services are responsible - this will reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave work".
Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers today, explains the Chairman of the Board of the FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - a future migrants are sentenced to clashes with the incompetent people, who will help him "the command" to horrendous, tight dwellings, in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will spend months without food and documenting and working for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their country, but when they arrive, they cheat on passports, pay no pay off the promised wages," confirms the head of the main Chinese labour administration of MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't load it!
The less so that many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to work in Russia acknowledge that not only do they know the language of the country that they want to get into, but do not have experience even with the work in question.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, as it is rather bad: only very few Turkmenistans, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
For their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed properly, shoes, and equipment for school.
As children grow up at a productive age, they must be released for work on their first occasion.
Without language knowledge, it's hard - admit it.
"You feel humble and less precious."
It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out with those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take tests or get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as much as they used to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry."
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police staff know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and that causes blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists about his experience a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be light, buy a painting."
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that fakes are not only evidence of migrants' registration.
The staff of FMS have already received several false certificates about the completion of the language exam.
Papers are printed on ordinary color printers.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope that they will facilitate the problem of passing the tests, paid for this document of 7,000 rubles.
That's two and a half times the amount above the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, including government officials and human rights defenders.
So far, the government can promise foreign workers who have failed tests for the first time, the time needed to pass the course of basic Russian language.
For visitors who do not have a Russian, work is expected in areas where active negotiations with people are not required.
The MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not take illegal weapons market into circulation
The share of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia proposes tightening the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: there were cases of shooting at weddings that went missing, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitriy Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can get a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the Committee on Security and the fight against Irina Jarovay’s corruption, which promised that changes in the arms law will be submitted to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "dating screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - require refusal of "insensual tightening" law.
The percentage of holiganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared Vasilij Lesnikov, lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed in six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
Open letter authors are convinced that civil weapons legislation does not require perpetrators to switch to the 'black' market.
According to their words, at present any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranic, who worked at the Ministry of Education and General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot pages receiving arms orders
The first one-- "arm or army path", that means the weapon that was stolen during the battles on the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers, and by themselves the cauliflowers," says Baranic.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals at security forces.
Baranec explains that theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the authorities active in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military storage.
In many military warehouses, explosions are often occurring.
"It is proven that some fires were set up intentionally - so as to cover up mannequins," says the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to the words of the Barance as well as the weapons manufacturers.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market and they are excluding weapons that supply to the black market, including Moscow," said this expert.
The next source of the "black" market is smuggling.
Especially a large number of guns and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"This is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in the shop, and there was a mob that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have read what is the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons into the 'black' market.
In 2011, the Centre for Analysis of Public Administration Problems and Design developed a report on this issue.
Specialists have broken down reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reports researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market by "vin officials whose work is connected with weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons of armed conflict came from armed conflict, 14% of the weapons were stolen in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The consultant-consultant of one of the arms stores he asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "acheology" no one buys long ago - they're just too old.
Most often, as he says, the sellers go for new shipments directly to military storage.
Despite the banner, the buyer buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun with him, and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take her to the city and sell it for 900 euros for a piece with two reservoirs," he tells.
"The truth is that the police are well in the painting, and that's why whenever they start to burn a plan in the clarity of crimes, they will run a check-up with traders with illegal weapons," the adviser adds.
"As in a luxury store"
The sellers most often find each other through their friends.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up, who offered me the opportunity to go to the "test" platform where there will be a man who would lead me to a "cut" where we will act together.
Mostly I learned the prize up there
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranic
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, a tell-it-all salesman-- a counselor like that I have, but I don't trust him fully.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "from Mr Ivan Ivanovič, who asked me to tell him that my daughter's tooth fell off."
And now I'm gonna get over a man I'm sure of.
He will only deliver them to me, because he knows I won't give it to him.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he processed the stand to publish on this topic.
The chart hasn't changed according to his words.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "all you thought."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls a soldier.
The Buyer, according to the words of Baranice, does not offer the rabbit in the bag - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, I just don't buy - we're going with the seller in the woods and we'll build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and if I convince myself that the gun shoots well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Stock on the couch
The search engine will bring you to the website and groups on the "Vkontak" where you can buy weapons for different purposes.
There are no documents or personal meetings to do that.
"It's just to have a set amount of money," they write in the advertising note on the website "Buy a combat gun or a automatic machine."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sell it to a minor?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the manuscript is kept).
"I buy TT.Moskva" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of loaded websites and those who wish to buy a military weapon can use a shovel.
People get laid like hungry fish on bait, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and High Military Officer Viktor Baranic
I have heard of such diagrams:web pages are usually registered beyond the limits of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will pay through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," says the press spokesman of the non-governmental organization "right to gun" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that when you place your order on the website you can stay without weapons and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of loaded websites and those who wish to buy a military weapon can use a shovel.
"The people are like hungry fish on bait and then they get coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, you will pay between $100 and 900 as estimated by experts.
According to the words of Dmitri Kisl from the non-governmental organization, you're going to get Makarov's gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from storage warehouses for long-term storage by means of warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to January - October 2011 and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clear cases of theft and blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood workers and supermarkets strike
Working at the cash register of "McDonald" will pass through a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, protests against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave is converted into a 9th wave, or whether it is meant to disappear soon.
They support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by leading workers in Walmart and in fast refreshment systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
Currently, this economic sector is virtually intact by the trade movement.
46 cents a year?
The event began last week after thanksgiving, in the so-called "black Friday" when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, received millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day some of Walmart’s workers, in which they work at 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade chains’ unions and left-wing activists of transnational chains whose goods are intended for lower and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy themselves at work.
Availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because it only pays a few employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or hand scanners.
The demonstrators on "black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the costs of health insurance provided by the company increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical Walmart worker receives $5.5 an hour, but that does not correspond to the amount of expenditure, says the staff.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley say that if Walmart increases average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on wages now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages to consumers fully, each visit will cost only 46 cents more in the shop.
In a year, customers spend around $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s defenders point out that protests were held only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no harm.
"Black Friday" in stores lasted from 8 hours of the evening on Thursday until midnight on the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her deposits made almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday" on "black Friday".
Dan Fogelman’s deputy representative stated in an interview for the left-hand Huffington Post that jobs left a total of "less five" of Walmart’s employees, and that protest was all the "other media sensations" they organized.
"Unscrupulous treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's business houses (they are not too much in this progressive town, and therefore they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick, and he doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaada Williams, a member of New York City Council
At present, it is a minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and the New York State rules of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wages, but only slightly, and on average they get their numbered workers in New York $8.90 per hour.
There's no lower wage in this expensive town.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The work of "McDonald" will go through nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work for a pult after school at part-time and live with their parents.
Few people in this see their main source of nutrition or plan to stay over there.
At the moment, I am constantly meeting in an interview with "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live out of this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how you feed them.
The protesters, which started at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cash and cooks in fast refreshments begin receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade union organisations to be established in the section of fast refreshments.
American laws prohibit the administration of the establishment of trade union organisations and punish the activists of the trade movement by bullying and release.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier.
However, the introduction of a high-speed refreshment in the enterprises of the trade union is complex also for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high fluctuations of employees.
I do not agree.
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the middle of the event, there was a meeting at the "McDonalda" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, especially a member of the City Council of Jumaada Williams, who said, "McDonald," says he sells billions of portions, and then you don't get paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said, "we have to step out together to support fast-food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, such as every New Yorker!"
As described by New York Times, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of America's fast refreshment.
But there were only a few hundred people in it, even though not all of them were staff of fast refreshments that employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark, which will light the flame of the mass movement, it is not yet clear.
"Amongtime, the brain is being deceived on average"
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular topic of widespread reality; recently it means seeing the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At the beginning of summer, Google presented the working model of this news at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that the application for the relevant patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
With an interview with a leading group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it shows that glasses are already past for scientists of this company.
It is a perspective for handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public sites.
Please tell us on the frame, what is your research group?
- We are dealing with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humankind has been stuck in the work stage with pixels on the flat screen, most of all touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting option to control using gesture.
- What else will happen to us in the future?
- No matter the Kinect system has transferred interactions to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add more appropriate virtual objects to the real world.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely he cannot be regarded as a mess - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project for controlling devices in public places, in which we thought about gestures, but not about twilights, just such snuff, short ones.
At the same time, the band would not eat a camera device, but a bracelet to watch the movement of bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
How, for example, do you ask me to give you this soda can?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what can or can't the machine at a given time?
- That's not necessary, but it's mutual.
In the near future, I think we're going to have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can better identify human reactions.
This can, for example, be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- To talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or anything else?
- Pretty much current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels, it's like math and depth.
With the current perspective of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it assigns work to algorithm designers.
So we must remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axis, but also the Z.
So the speed, the number of images per second is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are frankly a little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable delay of processing of 1 to 100 ms, while currently serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
It would be a very useful equivalent to me at work, but I just don't need that much touch, but I need some extra photos.
- No need to increase the number of cameras?
- Three "carers" are now being used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - that's actually the common sensor of the visible zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue system, play with a curved camera location and see how it helps to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I recall, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think it's one of the most promising platforms when it comes to the daily use of reality-encouraged technologies with special glasses?
- Of course, walking and keeping the smatphone in the bottom hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transmissible" like the extension of reality, where it would be possible to switch from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection screen and around again every time.
Brown - this is a very personal device, in which is their strength (the whole thing only you see), and at the same time weakness - the extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't smell anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
I often say in my lectures that extended reality - that's the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think it might be an eighth breakthrough to supplement the tangible impressions.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain kind of background for displaying.
In an excellent way, it records compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the tangibleness of these "images in the air" - such as interference of several direction ultra-sonic beams at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a tangible feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on the belly of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brains yet?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at a given moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a very tight space to believe that he's walking through an open, virtually endless space - we also work on the concept of cross-country lines (not just like in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain deceptiveness becomes a goal, then working for many years.
This is what works on virtual reality is so attractive for researchers - many things are in the very beginnings.
tasteful instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradian Avantgarda", dedicated to the citizens who are led by it, are the avantgard of culture and art.
At the top of the list there were already important figures of the design scene of St Petersburg, whose decorations go beyond the city, they often find recognition in Europe without reaching the occlesiastical faith.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man who's all dressed up in red, which you meet at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Gardens, in fashion pubs and vernisages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical petrohrad talkers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is an ingenious man of petrohrad airtgarde the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the faces of citizens, it enhances all the mood.
He recently took into his hand the flaginet and became a petrohradian flag, because in this complex role he finished with his whole divine life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer in terms of appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, everything that's slightly different from the grey one, builds aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to discuss.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exposed.
I understand what my way is.
That's when the wave of old unofficial, unofficial artists passed and I couldn't understand the new, free type of artists.
I was friends with artists of new waves, post-gazonski, who brought us to "Pushkin 10", and there were no more waves.
It's been humming for me to theatre, dress, music, all the genres except for the word.
And all this was said to be in your pedigree...- for me it was important to be in the center of Peturburk culture, where all the best of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a place in Pushkin 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the Pestěrburg bohemian.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under a glass of light songs, dressed in tight tricorders, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg has run many programs of halli-gallian time.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, by which he began his great career, basic education and training he gained from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Grigałedov - that's the title of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and permanent guests left.
I'm the hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was organized in the press, a special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination of the "Marriage of the Year" I was appointed, thus finished my peak.
In new times according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am the man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In these years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are a distinctive way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits where there are live captures of actuality and permeability.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum in clowns.
The clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be social, today it is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is shaking, there's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in the order.
Today people meet according to their clothes, they're focused on external mechanics, not on the inner human being.
Or maybe he can't hand him and he needs to spit in his face.
And the trick will be removed by dressing.
We've seen you in the role of a city flagger recently... a cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be he if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- There should now be commercial, useful art thorough, tactical, sweet.
There is a devastation of cultures.
Previously, people met in stupid, the gods loved one, simple people.
Today, everything has broken down into micro-community, it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bank to please everyone.
You need to think about who you're going to like today.
Today every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand viewers will come to Stasu Michhalova!
- Fans come across him, that's where he engages sexually social spheres.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land, and ten thousand will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything will go away.
I've got fans, the main thing is, no one's gonna fool 'em, and it won't break what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were used by one collector on the wall together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings people usually end up with.
Today, people are often confused with concepts.
They say: The spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's different.
I'm a man of culture last day, I grew up in examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money because of drawing paintings.
And I'm for such a culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Petérburk?
- A good cultural expert.
There is such a concept: an activator through a culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
It wasn't in all that for the good days of the Tsars, but they understood that real experts needed to be encouraged.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because there's a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
She's going through tastefully today.
The same Erarta, but they are different from the fact that they say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petierburk is?
- Petěrburk - it's not the capital of culture, there's a much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And at our level, art is doing awesome.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
With us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented under the means of the grant of St.Petěrburk
To be born in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Karavans of space cobras with earth on board are issued on the road, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your family under pressure or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted even though hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sudin, a highly built scientist of the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, Venus has reached a temperature of 500 degrees Celsia.
Live there is possible only at a large height or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
Questions about reproduction began by scientists with flora in space.
The experiments on plants were carried out half a century ago.
The four generations of games developed in the orbits are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was removed into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979 a quail egg was sent into the universe to verify how the embryo is developing in a state of troublelessness.
At the exit we get absolutely normal bird.
But then things start.
"The problem is that this bird must find resistance, he must stand on his own legs and begin to move," says the Head of the Institute of Biomedicine Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they can't find resistance, birds fall chaotically and make chopsticks.
After 10 hours, in freshly hatched birds, there was an absolute destruction of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"Two times we let birds hatch, but then we refused, because it is impossible to work there with them," comments the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew on a orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In biospatiality "Bion" but only beings of one sex will be.
There was an experiment with rats who had already been broadcast to space.
They basically didn't show anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be done," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on earth, a offspring was born to space pots.
However, it has not yet been possible to draw close to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
The animals in the loss of their usual environment simply cannot implement their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens manages abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tareskovs.
The most expensive thing that mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tea has left, and no one on Earth could say whether it would last for years in space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"For the first time no one has answered this question," says the veteran of the rocket-space sector Vachtang Vačnaga.
In June 1964, more than a year after her flight into space, she gave birth to Valentina Téreshkov's first wife.
Andrijan Nikolaev was also the father of the child.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaution of Light Savicky was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who after long years were born and healthy offspring.
"It can be dangerous even during orbital years," says the astronaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian hero Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably seek new pathways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in terms of zero attraction, spacemen adopt the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water's imitating the state of distress.
For adults, water is comfortable, but in a strange way, it is natural for young children.
Small ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in her mother’s fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, they will only take 2 weeks.
"That's very little to make the child forget something," says the instructor of swimming the newborn Marina Axenov.
In short, if the state of natural conditions for a newborn baby is more difficult, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of trouble, the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pan are getting very fast, and the body’s ability to drain the fetus is reduced.
We can leave this aside if the muscle stimulators work in childbirth.
After all, it is possible for birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism will drain the fruit.
"What's next?" asks Valerij Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not act as a natural attraction, it cannot properly shape the cortex or muscle system.
A newlywed on a orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he can train.
It's just going to be done with what he needs to do with his development unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring the disabled person on Earth, who will be completely irresistible to the present environment," says the head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission.
So the separation of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, there will come a time when the reality will become a reality, and when the earthmen will go out in their cobras on a far-reaching planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: System Control failed with the blame of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but in its application.
In an interview for News.cz says vice president Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct to its application - that's what we think is missing," comments Kal's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter Nečas’s approach to the so-called "svarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with his controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can prevent the office from carrying out its duties to control and enforce its duties," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German side, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was that all about?
It's a parallel control we started about two years ago.
The simple point is that the European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation, and then by its own practice.
We have put all this together, and even though the check is not yet completed, we have very interesting differences - in general, legislation is perhaps even more strict and perfect in us, but some parameters are better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but the application of the law itself needs to be addressed.
What can this project help you to do with it?
Such a joint control could help to stop making efforts to enforce laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal conduct.
But by reducing the contract limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Maybe the system is going to go down with so many "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw a lot easier than the limit would be higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public contracts in practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO is there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, is simply a little different, but in principle both authorities are doing the same thing.
The powers are similar to a certain extent, but by Germany having a corporate arrangement, these courts also have at the level of the various federal countries - in which the system is slightly different from ours.
The BRH can only control the company's money, our state-owned money.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the corporate accounting courts.
What about the legislation there, so it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects it is Germany described as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in all things.
Is it also necessary that they have better controls?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that sort of comparison.
But it should be said that even the countries that we consider as a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, what was the amendment of the Law on Public Contracts that has already shown its impact?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, we do not yet show ourselves in the control actions.
Because we're doing ex post controls, we need to count on a certain delay.
So far, we are only looking at this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "risk detection" through which we have undergone nearly 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analyzed them - there of course these changes will manifest, because the limits change, the conditions of some types of sample management will be adjusted and so on.
Do you, therefore, consider the approval of this law to be of benefit or other burden on red tape?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it confirms.
The problem that might arise here is that it rules "restraint" and it will not be possible to keep them.
Already under previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Contract Law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore worth making the law stronger in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must exclude those who want to assault and abuse him and not punish those who commit formal doubt that has no impact on decisions.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So what's out of it?
Let's see how it goes.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "sustaining system" - and what does that mean?
The system is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can prevent an office which is responsible to carry out checks and enforce duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're going to do nothing.
In the Public Contract Act, there are rather strict rules on how to formally be implemented - which is right to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when those interested in the best offer are excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct to its application - that's what I think is missing in our opinion.
Roads are pointy places, mostly but mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are irritable and snowy.
Most of them are mobile, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, there were road tracks this morning, but places were slender and snowy as well.
Temperature fell between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is supposed to warm slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Krušné Mountains, however, there are about 30 centimetres of snow.
The sites were even lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data from the dispatch of regional road drivers.
The high speed roads R6 and the communication of the first class are now mobile without limitation in the region.
However, caution is on site, for example, on some of the bridges, where the surface can be mutilated and lucid.
All roads of the second and third classes including mountain roads are also mobile.
In some sections, however, there are residues of frozen and the places of the snow run.
Particular attention should be paid to driving in higher positions.
Pardubic and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Bohemia, there is a threat, in higher positions, and on the mountains there may be a heavy layer of snow on communications, informs on its website the Directorate of Roads and motorways.
The motorists warn drivers against impact, may, in particular, be formed in the higher positions of the Cardubian Region.
It can be found in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or the High Meth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, roads I/43 and I/34 are treated at Svitav.
The snow is especially on roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The occupied snow layer is in the highest places on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžna and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is most often clear to the point without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, blowing the weak wind.
Plzen region
Roads in the Plzeň Region are mobile this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to adapt the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures move between three and nine degrees below freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication can be agitated.
The positions must be calculated by the driver with fog, but visibility will be gradually improved.
It's coming from information from the dispatch of regional motorists.
The D5 motorway is nearly unlimited, but caution is advised by the communication administrators between 80 and 131 km.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, but there may be sharp sections.
Communication of the second and third classes is wet, and also in this case alerts to the point sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent travels in the area of Šumavy.
Olomouc Region
With snow coughing on the road, today they have to count drivers heading to the highest location of the Olomouc Region.
After a chemical draught, she remained on the redhore seat on the road in a direction on the Videlský Cross.
Road drivers drove into the terrain in the night of snow, in Šumpersk, according to the road managers, about three centimetres were snowing.
In the other parts of the region, roadways are usually non-restricted.
"Sumperland lies in the highest places of snow.
They must count their drivers in direction on the Jeseník," said the CTK today the dispatcher of the Šumper road management.
In the field at night, their colleagues went out to Jesenicka, the journeys and the highest positions are now following chemical treatment of wet and wet.
On Olomouc there are road without restriction, however, the drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Ústecký kraj, Liberec region
Just a few difficult roadside places are reporting this morning the roadman in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with a snow attacked or iceberg, the mountain road from Telnice on the Knínice in Ústeck is closed, it results from a police database.
Temperatures are also held below zero at lower positions, so ice and snow are likely to last on roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Central, there are no problems, and roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not been reported yet.
The occurrence of refrigerators is reported by motorists especially from the area of Příchtí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for her were ideal at night - during the day of rain and sinking, bright and freezing at night.
In particular, adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road at the border of the Ústecky and Liberec Region.
The lock from Telnica to the Book forced the moving branches of trees, which under the snow to bend to the road.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think he's supposed to end the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap, we make fun of it and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to distance or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him closer to the readers?
It's a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th, 21st, will be held simultaneously with 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about a time when on the Kiribati island in Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone, ends in the mayan calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist, Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which one day we will hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May Calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, trinkets, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Group also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, called the end of the world.
She's very popular today on YouTube, and she's going to sound like one of these benefit concerts, too?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, if we succeed in all this and the end of the world does not occur...
All the interpreters sing it at all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymns will also be connected at once in unique direct transmission to Czech TV.
Words to this song wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video are played by Tomáš Hanák, and the song is also written by Xindl X...
How did you get along with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beats and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoying themselves.
What will be the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the barrier-free educational center, Studeo, which we have been implementing with the civil association of Tap in Jedlicko Institute for the sixth year.
The students of Jedlčkova School regularly come to school and are dedicated to the activities they enjoy and interest in.
Students do not have the means to go out on their own for teachers, so we are trying to allow them this way.
Within the construction of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several music groups and interpreters will perform.
What did you choose them from?
We tried to set up a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China, Support Lesbians, Illusstratosphere with Dane Bártou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details will be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some sort of "bombospic action" for the future?
In May we will be first performing at the Prague Spring, so here we will also definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the United States, would like to link this to the Washington and Chicago gig.
Your foreign plans are not minimal, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap, however, is a group that is formed by the handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members in the electric cart, her trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, and we will certainly bring with us a large amount of cargo and bed with instruments...
However, so far, it has always been done without problems, the ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared for me to wonder how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how they differ in barrier-freeness, public access to eendicated and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than with us, we were just seen in Russia that everything was still in full beginnings in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric cart to move himself in the center of the city.
It doesn't even pay for self-evidents, as if the wheelchairs prefer the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that try to alert people with disabilities.
On the other hand, what do we still have to catch up with a more advanced country?
There are a lot of things in which we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy hendikep move independently in public can go to the toilet, to museums, anywhere...
However, it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, in the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap!
Respect for public or barrarianism is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change for real.
So far, it's rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what made you start it?
I started out as a tutor at the Jedlicko Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play saxophone among other things, so I started an interest music ring with my colleague.
Well, and in time, what our moderator tells us, Láda Angelovich, is a little out of hand.
But the popularity has come up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It was true that it helped us when we began to communicate with famous singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
We figured out a job that can't be seen, basically it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for doing something different.
Showbusinness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in a way, all new is taken care of, and it takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is regret, it's natural...
But this regret is completely unnecessary because people with hendikep are no sufferers of all the abandoned beings we must regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided that they have the necessary means.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a hendikep, it's not just going to go for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help that you are a tough boss, how many people have identified you?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in many ways incompromise and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, they have to go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the trip to the concerts, the enthusiasm will leave them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were in her early in 1998?
Only one Angelovich Bear.
We're an open group, people leave and come, that's impossible.
Who has the will and taste, has always got the door open to us
It will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoj will take place in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected at the end of the evening by a telemoste in a song band The Tap Tap "The end of the world has been canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather funds for equipment of the multi-functional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at the Jedličkova Institute in Prague, volume 25 million CZK
entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free tickets in pre-sales Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was adopted at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency in 20th Member of this European Space Agency as the second country from the country of the former Eastern Block (in the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008.
Poland launched close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of projects of the Agency during the following years.
However, Poland’s journey to space has begun much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were devoted to space before World War II; but not always they met with understanding.
For example, the lecture A. Šternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which on 6 December 1933 represented ideas from his pioneering work Entering space.
The ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left a listener of the cold and after the years of Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for Enternfeld in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonauts.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-known space promoter, and his contribution was also appreciated by one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway wire was built in Poland, which was intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there are no specificities of the project.
It is neither clear whether the rocket was to be used for launching or for its dissolution.
Information about this woodwork is known only from the time press.
Since 1933, missile missiles have begun to deal with Polish artillery.
The research provided the Mobile Technology for Armies in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Professor Gustav Mokrzyckigi.
From preserved materials it is obvious that research has reached the stage of practice tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops has been interrupted.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric attack missile, designed by Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the expert press and the following year the work of Rakieta - torpedo and rocketombomba air pilot by Lelegý-Krzywobłocki.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the temporary scientific advisory committee (Temporary Advisory Committee) coordinated all the projects of the military use of rocket technology.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended with the start of war.
After the war, further work by the Polish astronaut Society (Polish Astronautic Society) appears after the Polish press war.
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November edition of the 1954 magazine of the Problems, where there are four more extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with space.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already started, and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronaut Society (PTA) has tried to enter the International astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and has become a proper member in autumn.
And in the following year, the first president of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He held this function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of highly successful meteorological missiles RM (the weather rocket), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The 1800-meter rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bled desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should have been able to real scientific work - RM-34 rocket should have reached 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The result of the first RM missiles became Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differed in the size of space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was a space of 0.4 litre, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, he took place at the Air Institute of Development of the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
There is still a need to mention Poland's entry to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and to create a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research within the Interkosmos program in Soviet artificial cooperatives and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Law on Public Works repealed.
The resolution caused a live discussion in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a wider point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between them.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free trade, nothing to limit the movement of private capital together with continued financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in the price of work, (limit) there is a price pressure.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods in competition by "containing" the competitive price in order to put a greater market share on the market and thereby increase its own profits.
This means, on a mass scale, for most entrepreneurs, either translate the production into abroad or shop there cheaply or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its unemployment generated, social expenditure of the State is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation makes it possible for the business masters to pay taxes and thus replace the economic and social damage they did in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Inadvertent practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to all the people, regardless of social downturn.
This is manifested primarily in changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to receive a price bid for private capital, especially in the field of wages.
However, this is a system of economic law enforcement in the case of long-term unemployment, but reducing workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been many years of public food supply for poor people who cannot benefit from their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of increasing competitiveness, the German economy is very common in cases where well employed people receive such wages that they must be brought into existential minima.
Such scandal was also published in case of auxiliary employees of the company's dream.
By no means do the measures of virtually all southern EU countries lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic social level fall are forced either to emigrate as they were in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages at the edge of the company, hoping that a private investment capital may come to the country one day.
But where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty from one country to another is moved, or it does not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africans still work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the entire Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media are saying that the state cannot capitalize itself on its own economy that the controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists on the view that the State must not intervene with management interventions in the economy.
Then it should be asked whether private capital is not affecting, now it actually manages politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
There is a clear answer, yes.
The proof is that there is virtually all-powerful existence and in all states all-compatible lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SCN, the situation is that the state Ministry for the lack of funding is putting in place proposals for laws to private law firms, which are lost in connection with industry.
These bill proposals are then agreed in Bundestag.
All power does not come from people as Western constitutions say, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly reaching out to the situation of the Appiáns in its work of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompeia: "The state has long been in complete decomposition and the authorities have been in violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of yarns and by means of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were held without any power, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice," ...the poor people did not go out at all about the office, so once it was a state of eight months without consuls."."It was indeed the talk that the only cure in the bad situation was self-control and that it was necessary to choose an energy man."
The conclusion as in the anti-dumping is the present society based on a carefree preference of its own benefit, regardless of the whole of its interest.
The private capital is no longer able to understand and apply all-occupied benefits.
The result is now, as is the case now, the improbable decadence of elites without any attempt to reform the deeper nature.
We therefore need to seek in the carefree liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries in the case of fascist and communist regimes.
At present, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered as a certain break with the expectations of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the present elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnessing with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and intra-European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek a way to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The targeted policy-social reforms that will strengthen the State's participation in the economy will strengthen the impact of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolistic position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the State.
Israel: The chaos lab.
"There is nothing to come of violence, and nothing can ever come" Sting in a song by Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how we're fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, there have been a lot of reactions.
One stands for Israel, arguing with his right to self-defense, and Palestinians are in charge of the role of terrorists, others are supporting Palestinians, arguing the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and Israel's state is a part of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodicly repeated waves of killing by the vineyard and who the victims, after all, today's people of Israel, including their own territory, were born into the current political situation and the beginning of violence.
The point is to offer readers a view of the tyre, to whom, above all, has been serving 95 years of stress (based on Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who, or so, who a group of people is the main factor in modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, a struggle for power.
In each era, we can monitor one of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities, who are completely autonomously driving their steps, or whether someone behind their throne was the one who directed their actions towards a pre-avoidable goal.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have come after the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one who might consider himself the head of the octopus (if there is yet someone above them, but I do not rule out) - Rothschields.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop connecting their names with highly criminal acts in whose background they stood and which have always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplying of wealth or both.
They have main interests in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where the shares in the central bank are not in or are preparing war (before attacking Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the Kaddauf's collapse, there were only four but Russia was ordered by the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the central bank status of Rothschield Bank of America, began to spend his own money in the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel FED, he was murdered 1963, Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars with the highest leader, 33rd degree of dedication to Albert Pike.
The first war was designed to remove the great monarchic state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estate, especially the UK and the third was to reduce the world population somewhere to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (the number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing but the predominant for such solutions) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of richest families head-on with Rothschieldy is working to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED in order not to repeat the crisis as the one that they created in 1907).
So after they succeeded in murdering the habsbury successor to the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo started World War I, they destroyed Russia with the launch of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded, capitulation of Germany (which did not need a war to destroy the heart of Russia) and then a fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria Ukraine.
For the easier starting of World War II, policy bankers had to create a stand-alone situation in Germany by imposing a huge war reparation on Germany, thereby creating the assumption of radicalization of impoverished masses and then just enough to push the Germans with sufficient strength, culprits indicating and simple solutions offered by the Leader and by creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and then they played the function of the fifth column, in the fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields stimulated the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned has created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first encounter with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War, if Hitler fell off the chain in which it was initially held by international bankers, or all he had done in the plan was difficult to estimate, any suffering of European Jews in the concentration created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state to the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations of Germany, was made at World War II, a declaration by the State of Israel was created by the outbreak of World War Three.
If the international bankers are able to dissipate it, the Jewish nation, like the other one, will be the victims in the first line of combat, now together with the Arab or the general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of wreath and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let us only imagine how hard people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where wrong lies in an endless chain of violence, when at first all there was greed for individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers only give their own candidates their choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is Netanyahu's typical example of fascist, to the international bankers loyal, a policy that is doing everything to launch a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in Shanghai, is a typical example of co-operation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), has threatened to grow in a global conflict, and given the control of Iran over the Hormuzian Pass, which travels 20% of all world oil (the flood corridor is only 2 miles wide) to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now the word that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted during the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And he forces all small and great, rich and poor, both single and slave to have on their right hands or on their forehead, so that he cannot buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of the beast or the numerator of her name.
That must be understood: who should understand the numbers of the beast?
That number refers to a man, and that's the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: If he is the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied the dav demonstration Islamic students of the American embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the severed effort of Mohammed Réz Páhlí, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - to throw the scale across board could not afford it, because it would significantly jeopardise the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a wound for the United States prestigious, which later deepened the fiasis of attempt to free the hostages with force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after the negotiations were directed by the Algerian Government.
Their work at home has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections 1980.
A film by directing actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of America's history that brought a small victory.
Six employees fled from the embassy just before the embassy was taken.
After complex peripeties, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film show, which in the country looked at the location for sci-fi large film production.
Combination of genres
The plan that devised the expert on the "exfiltration" of Tony Mendez called for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialised magazines, organized a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On one side, a realistic political thriller, also called "capper movie", a story of a dubbed piece, a subsemployment - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
This is how the moods are cut in the film - on the one hand the documentaries from Tehran (in the title section are shown iconic photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was shown in the film - there are no major differences in this).
On the other hand, a lighted passage from Hollywood, concurred with irony and a mild surplus.
And then there's a scene from the CIA headquarters and other institutions--the men in the suits-- they're tearing up the situation at the table, the office halls, the phone...
Ben Affleck, in a remarkable way, made a restart of careers.
From a smiling actor he became a respected director and his acting stopped being the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crimson of Goone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afflelk image not to play in director's Boston home.
The quote for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the directors of older films increased over Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows him in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are made in the streets, when reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also mediates the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that arise when they move out of history.
Affleck and his co-workers have similar effect in the scenes of fiction (false staff on the Teheran Baser).
Too many stories in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story of story does not actually offer much in the film sense of the intensification scene.
He's doing a lot of work with this, sometimes he's thinking about reality - everything goes so elegantly there (the one in which the threat crisis at the Teheran airport turns off the phone call in America and the hounds after the morning work a little bit attached to his hair).
However, the weakness of Arga is the distaste resulting from the necessity of showing too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, although very charming, their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only one in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be followed with a mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style of liberating thrillers for the '70s.
But it's gonna take a lot of time.
As a reminder of one still certain way of living history and proof of how excessive the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are are, but that is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces an survey on the most appropriate banking fee, has now decided to launch a competition for 'inclusive regulation or ideas from the EU workshop'.
"We have been told by the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court on the unification of insurance fees for men and women is among the nominal absurdities.
Women have been favoured in life insurance prices so far because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
One of the EU's controversial regulations is to include the mandatory mixing of biofuels into fuel fuels, which is due to damage to nature, also the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances or a directive on the size of blind cages, for which they have made a lot of healthy eggs this year.
The criteria had previously been faced by a real ban on the use of the term anointing butter or the elimination of classic light bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas are to have 14 centimeters
The EU's apparatus often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a country or group of states (so the Czech Republic now also promotes the demands of its banks by the threat of the veto).
The interest of the lobby was also because, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach at least 14 cm in length and could not show "anomaly curve".
However, the European Commission has prevented itself from harmonising the current unanimity of national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU rules on fruit and vegetables have already softened the EU’s resistance to certain countries, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the survey may also be an EU regulation last year, which requires that children under 8 years must not inflate without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred itself to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 years of age while blowing into the pilgrimage frecks.
Curious ideas are born at home
In fact, the rule on European officials themselves - everyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, instead of speaking about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Server Bank fee.com, in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, has nominated the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, even EU regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established maximum levels of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes of preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with a high fine.
An even thought was to pay some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies at the request of receiving subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not exist in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're being tainted by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We ask the European Union for a refund," said the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palestine in autumn 2004 (ČSSD).
As an argument, many grains were born in us and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state of full storage which had to be exported.
For the Czech Republic to continue to its ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palase.
Finally, the European Commission went out to meet the Czech Republic by organising a trend for the purchase of grains from countries that have no access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the municipalities of the Ministry of Local Development (US-DEU) controlled by Minister Pavel Němkom (US-DEU), specifically to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulation is easily a target of criticism in Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate, at the same time, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union are more recognised by a number of experts.
A more serious problem is, for example, experts in drawing EU subsidies into projects that have no sign of anything in common with deepening European integration, but which Member States have forced in budgetary negotiations.
The emotions between the Czech Republic also raises the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to identify its traditional products in Brussels, and it does not always succeed in this fight.
Although after the six-year struggle with the Germans and Rakušany, the Czechs initiated the mark of the olomomic shapes, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to convert to the native.
The names of rum may carry only products of cane distillation, not of sugar beet.
In the official list of EU products registered in a company of world-famous cheeses of feta and gorgonzola, Marcipín from German Lübeck or parmish ham, for example, carlovaric droughts, mountainous and Greek capr and giance hops.
The EU’s protection mark can then also be proud of the pardubic pearls and magnesium tubes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I'm not going anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country being robbed, as thieves are running around, people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition being a politician.
But seeing something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been forty years and I'm an independent insurgent, I don't have any other way of affecting things than running for Senator or President.
You got into the Senate, but you went to Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for Castle by the end of the Senate elections.
Later, I explained that if I was elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a function, but a function is how I can make my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is, as a nation, we are selling in the pub and on television, but that we are going after anyone who wants to try to change.
This is what media people are adding to, who are degenerate and who are confused with the freedom of word to lie with freedom.
About me, maybe it was said that I was paying journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubk.
Let's go to your visions.
To fight for the Castle, you have set out with the material and criminal responsibilities of politicians and back-to-life confessions over 20 million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
As president, you have no authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you plan to figure this out?
When I was a citizen lobbying for the guidance to be a free trade, it was possible to do so.
The problem is political - if someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, he'll reject himself, and it'll keep the citizens.
As an independent nist, I have much more potential to get support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preferred priority is that without side-to-side squealing, and I can take something that is best for our country, from every side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing person or a left-handed person?
From the Czech point of view, I think people are more of a left.
It's not important to me at all whether a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to a left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're kidding when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it with what you said?
When you make business plans in the company, you also have an ideal target and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talking about by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you're going to be left with all your passwords.
And you don't get enough in politics for long.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to do for example a criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politics, journalists and the public, and try to get them on their own so that we can put this forward.
If I were elected President, there is no problem in organising direct television, where I will ask the President of the Parliament to exercise material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell them why they don't want her.
If there is a strong personality to name non-scraper, it can be pushed into a political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was the merit of public pressure.
I say on a plane that I'm amateur that I'm not even a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I've just started in politics, and I'm going to try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, unless I can, in six years, I'm done and I'm going back to the private sector.
A little bit of that sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been hugging a number of well-known people whether or not they'd run into the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, and he refused a lot of work.
So at least I supported the instigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who covered up frauds with light fuel oils.
I've been running for people to be unhappy, but now I'm in a fight.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and those who went were usually elected representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check out every potential party's history, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, but there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm guessing I'm worth about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, apartment for ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of art works in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and the Superb code for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against badness and crap.
You're riding Aston Martin, you've got 60 million worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
You want me to owe you one?
I've already hit 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that he's probably not that interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay from my campaign.
The campaign costs are basically going to cover what senator's salary I'm going to receive.
But I wouldn't survive him, for example, because I couldn't pay my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to make money, I'm not going anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd dampen these activities?
But that doesn't apply to pay.
As I promised, I partially silenced my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need to live from something, too.
How old were you to take a month as a businessman?
Two hundred and four hundred thousand, which I'm taking on.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You can find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of the Law.
The MVRDV architects are evidence that real adventures do not only take place in the head - such as Spitkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 photos
"This building seems happy to me, looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Oh, this house is nice."
But I'm asking what else we need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are volunteering today, right?
Spikenisse, located in close proximity to Rotterdam without his own job opportunities, which is not worth visiting, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has shown the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago a decision to contribute to general education and to build seven well painted iron miniaturs of fictional bridges that are depicted on euro banquets.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not a turning point.
And so the city councilmen knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of madly bold column graphs and a joker, often even cynical buildings, accepted a thing with normal tranquility and five books in 2003 appeared under the arm and grin on the face.
And while the Commission was looking at her and shrouding her shoulders, he plucked his sterling gifts by his size and his actically justified speech by the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal to the Mount of books in Spikanisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was drilled for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora's books were awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The Maloměstian gray, which has not yet been offered more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for which a white facade you would rather expect milk, is much richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
However, Spikensis now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
Long Path to Book
First impression: a reader's eldrado under a hatch for cheese.
Although through the massif of the mountains, you will discover the real spatial and readeral passions when you can master topography.
On all sides, the glassy interior is bright and clear, a floor made of burnt cable and elegant street mirrors clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally standing regals with books along the facades and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly cozy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we removed the space for the reader from the outside.
The Hory book interior is widely used: in the middle there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology.
The special comfort is the black fields on books, which are once covered by walls, once by parapet, and another collection of stairs.
Since the structure and smell are quiet.
Even architects and architects will hit the unknown building material with their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at Spikensis City Hall, on the question of Standard magazine.
And so in one French farm one day, we ran into a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years in greenhouses and in fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a foundation under the roots of millimetres of synthetic matter.
It is cheap and timely effective.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then it's mature to throw it into a volumed waste.
For the library there was a rouno - for the first time in this amount - they were lined to the plates with a thickness of four inches.
By using heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is painted in dark, homogenous and burdensome material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you'll get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 metres of long running you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only by fantastic views of the city, but also by Dutch croquets and fashions in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the best humidity of air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It melts and cools with the earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in just a short time, even in sunny days.
The wide glued wooden ties, which are standing around to the glass facade, serve as a glare and captures a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will handle full automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT business, already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogorde, which Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" Spikensis.
Reason: Every resident in town was invited to open up a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should first be filled with optical gaps in a library not yet fully equipped, which currently account for 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proved itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, everyone now has a relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she's just out of her hair.
This is how MVRDV managed in a royal discipline, which is called identity formation in a professional genre.
Spikanisse wrote the history of literature.
However young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Shabot: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained on the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the United States and Stephen Szabo, Berlin is now playing a close diplomat.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first reported at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for the Palestinians' observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's gonna support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
Germany also abstained from voting during the rebellion in Libya in March 2011 when it was the establishment of a flight-free zone.
That's where NATO settled down.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear view on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it's changing its foreign policy right now, from a policy that's been ruled by the US towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and united policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They expect to play an independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as France or the UK.
In particular, what does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the readiness to take both national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of others, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has a large haven in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but even elites in Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I wouldn't even want to add too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from voting for both important decisions, for example in the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the US there is great understanding for German attitudes.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was on Libya's question.
Perhaps Germany will even cause some respect.
This indicates that he must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are various views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US spoke clearly for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of the American internal policy.
I think Obama's government may have some considerable insight into the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot be held publicly.
I think the differences in opinions are not really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyhu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to bring its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand with the positions of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what's making this difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germany if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not happening.
They cannot therefore be part of the wider line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still hard to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany adopts a greater role, anti-German mood will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for various neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
The influence of the US in European policy is now falling, but the EU is not currently fulfilling this vacuum. Who else remains here?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and it'll make them even more unpunished - c'est la vie!

The "mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
This is followed by the marking which is officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection until they are claimed by actual brand owners.
And even then, it's not clear whether the law will come into practice.
"For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect in China its brand," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, specializing in violations of the protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, he lands on my desk a new case.
The counterfeiters just need a few extra letters so they can register their brands.
Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are legally copied, like the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens up with records of the stamp office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, there was a Chinese company to protect Zegna DF Puma’s trademark. A artificial name that parasites the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that China's masters are in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several-storey houses in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are different. With the mandate of his mandants, it follows that Chinese companies have received a completely official right to use the mark which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an affiliated brand.
This word focuses on Bang Dakuan.
That's what women who hunt rich men are meant to be.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages business, we have to wipe it," said Pattloch.
"The science is divorcing, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
Financial losses and court costs of affected business go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to CLSA market research data, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and markets that is growing rapidly.
However, the removal of questionable records in the register of marks can be difficult to achieve, and it is worth something.
The management may stretch to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court has rejected the action because the mentioned name became after a long period of "market reality".
If he has bad luck, he has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his mark in China, says Pattloch.
There's a jungle law sometimes.
The known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the construction machines of Sana, a company recently taken over by the German manufacturer of pumps on the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that looks like a Mercedes star to this day.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-breasted logo that resembled BMW. The company was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
While CCTMOs admit that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, apparently, "the course of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to the normal."
For example, the number of unworked proceedings for objections decreased by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, by 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet, there are still 81,500 complaints waiting at the Authority.
Something to do against it is expensive
As it is often in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO was delivered over 1.4 million brand protection applications, which is almost a third of more than 2010.
That's a record, and that means China has a list of new applications worldwide.
This also applies to the number of all valid protection marks - total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1,8 billion jüan were selected on charges.
This simply means that each login on average costs EUR 1280 or EUR 160.
Starting against this, the dispute stands several times as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
This company has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of car parts has been cancelled.
However, the counterfeiter ensured Chinese rights to Freudenberg continued.
We would remind ourselves of this because Germany cannot be protected by last name, says Hanna Wenzler, Chairman of Freudberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
He also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In two other instances, Freudenberg was able to exercise his rights, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
It's important to be careful.
Now the matter is discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wenzler has confidence that this matter will lead to a good ending and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The drive is extremely expensive and we have a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archive, they even had to look at hundreds of years of old files to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudberg was in vain offering a "high six-digit amount in euro" to settle the dispute.
"You can see from this what it means to us," says Wentzler.
It threatens that the dangers of the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that's when immitators make sure of unprotected marks.
In Germany, for example, one Chinese producer wanted to claim Freudenberg’s mark for footwear and leather.
This field of business has long given up, yet it has been able to reverse registration.
"You need to be careful," says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners should rather "all that is worth protecting in any way, even register in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudberg in the last act of his drama falls under the mark, then he may have to pay the licence fees for his own name against him, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the dispute.
World Day Anti AIDS: assing, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi is testing, and in Swaziland, the orphans are happy about it after their parents who died of AIDS.
A story of a connection that over 8733 kilometers.
First there's assing: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's wets looking for a dance floor, and they find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of singers, alt, bass, tenor, and soprano, are slowing down, the mothers, and each other run.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he connects his voices with his duly wild gestures.
It's Monday night at the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg trying a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers from 23 to 69 years, from the researcher of human genetics to the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every congregation voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - a zolu speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations programme for AIDS eradication, estimates that there are about 34 million people around the world who are infected with HIV.
Of this, 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
There are 245 000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, Esitjeni found a Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them go to second-degree school.
A patronate may be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees children a school, a school uniform and one hot meal a day at Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "true stories" in the language or "one who worships."
No one can talk in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
In an airspace distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitjeni in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, depending on the power of the German congregation’s voices.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clays or salted tarts, and a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they've been infected with HIV.
In Esitjeni it is seen in small, and the same as the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infectibility, the lowest expected life span worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of male foreskins, which clearly reduces the risk of a disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus with reduced immunity in them. There is no rare way they die in less than thirty years.
However, first of all, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets missing not only parent care, but complete all: food, clothing, education.
Without finished schooling, there's no chance in poor countries.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals that allowed a child to be sent to school for a few euros a year and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later the Voices for Africa Congregation was established, which has been taking care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
The facts of sexually transferable infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and capaque (gonore).
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papilomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The ammo and the spruce are one of the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and capaque occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert's Department comes from the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilids reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual relations between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydia infection, trichomonides, candidosis (plise), capillaries and human papilomavirus.
HIV is relatively few among heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV is affected by this group.
Young chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
Moreover, among us juveniles there are often human palillomaviruses.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert's Institute, the number of infected syphilis is more than doubled by 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIVs has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infection diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulties in urination, discharge, abdominal pain, even bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and they will remain unnoticed.
How can I be protected?
The dangers of disease can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For the cause of sexually transmitted diseases can be partly transmitted by infection from impurity and close physical contact.
That is why experts recommend, in particular in case of frequent sexual partners, regular examination.
In case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most of the SPI and to prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patrons, charity gifts, and, last but not least, to the honorers that the congregation has made by singing all over Germany, there will be some money.
"We have already sent around EUR 200,000 to Esitjen by the whole," says the vice president of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is being administered in the village of Zodle Promini, a self-confident woman who can assert himself.
It also ensures that mature children find shelter, for example, for some of their grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the zulus, is called the old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them also married 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads, and make sure that children come to school in time in uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays the band as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the American health organisation PSI, arranged that many people in the village had made an HIV test.
That's not self-evident, even though the disease in the whole country is so obvious, everyone's silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"Aids is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's pretty strange in the country where the King officially keeps his 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This State-approved way of life also bears the blame that the HIV virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who have spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchanges, the Imbongi congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sing songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and the self-confidence of the black continent, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from time apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of black people - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already taken out tears in many wild border soldiers.
The journey always leads to the Espijen where singers visit children who have a patron.
Even though you can hardly find this village on maps, the Ezulweni valley is more than known.
"Go to Esitjena, there's light there," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here by the airline 8733 km, to the fucking singers in the rehearsal at Bergheimer Straß, you can see that this light shines even here.
Messenger: NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
Soda Messenger found evidence that there's ice on planet Merkur.
The ice blanket could have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The US National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Merkur.
Even though there is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as it results from three studies published by the "Science" specialist magazine on Thursday.
Soda Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cube in the area of this planet, which lies in the permanent shade.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water seems to have come from comet or perhaps even from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not give the finding of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of scientists working on Messenger's probe, Sean Solomon.
Temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsia.
However, findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and strongest images of Hubble's telescope: varicose galaxy
The sketches of spiral galaxies become real works of art, according to their coloring.
The audience published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light-years away Trifid nebula in the Trifid Palace.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, three-clanal), because the dark stripe of dust divides the heart of this star’s obscenary into three parts.
In Hadonos astronomers’ constellations were photographed by the forefront of the cosmic fall: in the distance of 400 million light years from the earth, the female of the two springs of the galaxy, and must inevitably come to the collision.

Also, this star cloud, associated with Rosette's nebula, is still born by a new young star, and 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
There is no dust yet in this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only soon after the Big Bang when it was mostly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views in space: the most important telescopes
In 1608 Hans Lifthey invented the Dalek view. Before Galilee, he used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views that are mediating are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, Hale's telescope on the observatory Palomar near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had an average of five meters.
In America, Arizona stands Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into the universe with two mirrors, each with an average of 8,4 metres.
Interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge.
Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, its average is about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of cheap construction: the telescope is provided by an elongation at a height angle, which reduces its mobility.
At an altitude angle, the Hobby-Eberly telescope is also fixed in Texas.
His peculiarity is the high intensity of the light flow.
This, despite a relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the largest mirror telescopes of the world.
Using a radiotelescope in Arecib (Portoriko), scientists in the universe are searching for alien signals.
This radiotelescope has an average of 305 metres.

A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observer in the Chinese Andes.
It is here that Vera Large Telescope stands here, and it is honoring its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can light up the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for the Chinese ESO observatory.
Its main mirror is about 42 metres wide, and it is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space and through the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
Also in Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe are mediated by Hubble's space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, we have been given the edge of distant worlds.
The Cosmic Telescope Kepler has been searching since March 2009 for extrasolar planets - especially after those that are local.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture is documented with the latest preparations before the Kepler space telescope is launched.
The space telescope of James Webba (JWST) will be launched first in 2018 into space on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies in the Big Bang.
Scientists say there's ice in the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this because Messengers circle around this planet far closer to the northern pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent out in 2004, and is the first to go around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

We can call a wild romantic ride in Talyš.
Microbus runs around the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, expensive rivers and simple Selan buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
But this here is the narrowest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasus ethnic group of the Talyšes, which is not known too much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Caribbean and live for a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is driven by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here.
Eight hours are needed for 323 kilometres, because the road is only one proluded.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the country owethly in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajevo (48) is convinced that Lerik has the aim of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May has celebrated the Great Prize of Eurovision - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulajevo.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, about the only one in the world.
Here is documented life of almost eight dozen Talyšů from the area that are over 100 years old. Fatulavajeva shows black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still became a child.
However, the famous star of this museum is the sheep trapeval of Muslümov, which was allegedly 168 years old.
There's no such thing as a family letter.
And since the oldest person with evidence was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and in 1973 he died," explains Fatulajev.
This man was supposed to have been married three times, and he had 23 children, and he said he was still a father of a daughter at the age of 136.
So he wasn't wrong about the Jierali Müslümov at his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the Latin people in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "so there are extremely many very old men in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when there is no matrix.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live by a Bible age in a conspicuous way.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why does he live here in the south so many years old people?
The Azerbaijann guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talishes.
On the contrary, the director of the Museum of Fatuljevo believes that this is a nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of Talyš, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem very credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, the town of Rubaba Mirzajeva lives.
In 97 years she's still relatively young at this geographical width.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with a buttercake that's tirelessly collided.
Under the same roof there are eight people living here, including one of the sons of Mirajeva and the daughter, both of them have long been grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical abdominal glasses of "armad".
Mirzajeva's white teeth form a perfect line, and beneath the scarf, they're hiding a long dark blonde copy that proudly covers her son.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look good on me and keep their color.
"I've never used shampoo," says Mirzajevo.
One month's pension is enough for life
She'd always eat just what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything was better when the row took over the "loved father" Gejdar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds strange out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is made around the characters of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, his son Ilham was taken over by way of power.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan do not suffer need.
Mirzajeva receives a 230 manata pension every month (at least the same amount in euros). This is on the basis of the situation from which you can live well.
And perhaps she's right and a long-lived son of Mirzajeva: "Student people are enjoying great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, they're sealed, and they're happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Institute is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The extortioned demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the vastness of the earth.
It is open to discussing a future constitution based on the law of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president didn't spare the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for succeeding in this, I am responsible in front of people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, but above all to the Christian Kopts, liberals, enlightened by Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly debated in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" of the Nile, given to the grace of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "saving the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the degree of doctor of the U.S. University in Southern California really wants to save is not the Egyptians nor the world is clear.
Is justice supposed to be out of power?
234 Paragraphs, which the Chief Constitution Assembly with the superstition of Islamists, has in no time approved in the 15th hour's nightmare, partly raise concern.
As in the former constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "sads" mean?
It was and is an interpretation thing and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formula and its associated legal free space for a tighter interpretation of the charm.
At least it illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to the Sharia, it is necessary to consult the al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
It may not be necessary, but it may mean that the doctor will carry out the supervision of legislation, which would result in a real withdrawal of his lawfulness.
There are a lot of interpretations in the draft Constitution
The problem is also that the civil competence of the courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
There were up to 11,000 civilians in the military custody after the downturn.
As it stands in the proposal, the State should also protect the "right nature of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is inexorably formulated on the legal side that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by means of this paragraph.
In plain language, that means nothing but censorship.
In addition, in writing, there is no indication of the exact equality of men and women.
In addition, another paragraph prohibits the shameful or obsessing of the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
Yet, what is shameful remains, and how it will be prosecuted.
Similarly, the formulae makes it questionably impossible for people to "do away".
Just in this case already the President's caricature or the joke on the law enforcement account?
The issue of interpretation, as many more in this proposal, which Mursie will present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human voting, for the purposes of his words.
The Revolution is back.
For several weeks, the opposition has been formed against the anti-Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitution before they started paying.
"The Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahí, who has placed himself in the presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel Prize bearer and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed stated that the proposal of the Constitution belonged to "the wasteland of history".
Through the services of short news, Twitter accused the supporter Mursí that they want to do 'cos against democracy'.
"If he declares a referendum, we go to his palace and we drop him," said Jasir Said.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood is not punished yet," the Egyptian media quoted Chálida Ali's opposition policy.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to keep an eye on the referendum, thus making it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim fraternity has declared a sedigree, but not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the second bank of the Nile before Cairo University.
She was involved in many of the women and the Salafists who called for the application of God’s law.
They said to Mursi, " Clear the earth." They assured him, "The Koran is our constitution."
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, in which everything began, would probably trigger a situation similar to the civil war.
Apparently, Mursie's minions didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and the advocates of the draft constitution were loud and clearly expressed.
Now, it's time to let the people at the electoral uren decide which direction the country is to go.
The majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, claims Hafize Abu Sa'd.
The eight - year - old human rights defender and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or were standing in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are Sunday-free for him.
He was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution there are no words "human rights" or once," complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursie's extension of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous accusations against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new doctrine.
"It's time for the president of the civil society to make it more powerful," says Sa'd.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organisations.
Sa'da feels abandoned and international community that follows the game of ideological factions on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of there.
The demonstration on the Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."

Could the country's secret of success be associated with a local appetite for an extraordinary smelling fish?
Take a couple of cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you get the smell of paralyzing the smell of the cancer, one of the largest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a wonderful view - and in the air hangs omnipotent smell.
The cancer is a salted ostrich in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to go.
As it turns dark and it starts to cool, the Norwegians start meeting here in Fagernes at a festival dedicated to the best possible way to say it to the most extraordinary food.
"You eat it, and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk general", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
People all around us eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit rather than a cancer," says Havard.
The drink can overtake the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of Sushi that was on a long trip by bus.
The cancer is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no icebergs, the fish was soaked into airtight barrels with water and salt in the fall.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well surprised, they pulled out and ate - the senses would no doubt be dulled by alcohol.
Before just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At the moment, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are migrants attracting a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, which was still much richer than Norway recently, flows into the country for work.
The cancer is viewed as something important, indivisible, even though relatively inflating part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the most expensive dishes on the market.
Even though everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will come out to 9 pounds (14 bucks) per piece.
Norway often does not get into the global news - and it seems that most people do.
The name Anders Breivika, right-wing racist extremist, who shot 77 men, women and children in the last year, is still mentioned here.
Instead, the shooting is called "the event of July 22th".
Norwegians can only be hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of them was able to such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waiter Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents the prototype of nordic welfare.
We are, as you call, considerate people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely great.
We don't show up, we don't like glamour.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial collapse were throwing money they didn't have, the Norwegians had ropes on their bowls tightly loaded.
"As long as we can ski in winter and take trips in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat the carnage," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in the front of something to eat - I've had enough of the carnage.
I'm sure a burger like that is different, and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the smelling fish is back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where the Austrian is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live television broadcast, in which the moderator with a butterfly surrounded by a carrist plate.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"What scores do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our stab, Havard."
It's called applause and laughter.
A man falls out of the chair, possibly a goddamed with water.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto is preparing to take office, he is looking at Will Grant from the BBC for the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked even in the best times, steel curtains were set up closing several key routes to the capital and causing some chaos on the road.
However, the aim was not to prevent them from getting into work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the presidential sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
At the time of the office of Felipe Calderon, Mexico was economically well-economic, but the country was already under the influence of the drug war, which was estimated to have been the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a big commitment to reducing violence against the Mexican people," said President Peno Neto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before he shaked hands with the American president, President Pena Nita gained political experience as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
The ideas of the new leader are different in his old home, the folk and a vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
In Valle del Bravo, for example, they remember him well.
Citizens are assigning him the development of tourism in the airport and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now go to the city after one of the new highways that Pena Neto had built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the staggering and fiery roads that had been here before.
Boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect a real and permanent change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for President Pen Nieta, the Party of the institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope in the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years of power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Member of Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the President's Palace, Los Pinos is on the inside of Enrique Pena Nita expects many.
And he refuses to express the opposition characterized by the new president as a person without material content.
He's a very direct man, very interested in the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's mainly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many of their former governors have.
In Náhualcoyotle, also known as Ciudad Nem, there can be no contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
In many ways, the suburb of Mexico’s capital city itself, planted under the highway crossings.
And the problems in the village itself are also lasting and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help with the handling of drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially to force violence on women.
Only in the last two years were in the desert near the vast waste dumps dumped by dozens of murdered women.
By the time Pena Nieto was Governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the noorically violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Neta's critics say that, in his office, he failed to deal with the murder problem at an adequate level.
And worse, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the lost neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me the photographs of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner was murdered.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body were washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blows on him, and there was already a postmortem rigidity.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which the only word is "justice."
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, a troublemaker and a snorkel.
They just want you to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and I forget," he says.
The sword President of Pena Neto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime and a new president has promised to be his priority during his office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was Governor," says Mr. PRI Olvera.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong treatment, says the military prosecutor.
Military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim on gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's military service in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be rejected on the basis of gross handling of Manning in prison.
Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
Military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is charged with the greatest escape of classified material in the history of the United States, has missed many possibilities to complain about the gross treatment that he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein, during a cross-interrogation of Private Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during nine months of ties in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about wrong treatment.
The cross-appeal hearing, which took place during the hearing on a proposal for defence, rejected a case led against Manning due to gross detention at the time of detention itself being a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in custody.
Military Intelligence Analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, the military prosecutor Fein went through together with Manning's forms, which the officers filled up after meeting with Manning in Quantic's custody prison, where he was moved from July 2010 to April 2011 in a regime with increased security.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday for these forms, Manning admitted that he valued treatment by his guardians as "excellent" and overall treatment at the facility evaluated him as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints about the wrong treatment, although Officers Manning directly asked how they treated him, claimed Fein.
Manning replied that the concerns regarding the various problems were expressed orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote "no problems" (after they discussed fears), and that did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why he did not complain about his treatment in January 2011 when he met a commission assessing suicide thoughts which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury".
The military indicated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under the control regime for suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday to his arrest in Iraq and to transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to the custody prison at Quantico base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one time he fainted from heat.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very rousing.
"My world shrunk only on the base of Arifjan, on the cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that he spent most of the days (minimum 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, sutures, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he was always sleeping with a light from the outside cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he filed in Thursday’s statement on the fact that after he was forced to sleep in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and fellow prisoners at the morning count.
Manning said that he wasn't allowed to cover himself with his cover.
During the Friday hearing by Judge Manning, he stated that, under the orders of his officers, he considered that he had a blanket he could cover, but he admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his habit to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his dentures and glasses were removed from his cell.
His counsel hopes that the judge will take into consideration his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a court of law, whose beginning is expected to be at the beginning of the next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said that he was planning to plead guilty in lower crimes and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon declared that Manning was held in accordance with the rules on all arrested persons in connection with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, the illegal way in which the intelligence documents are published on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's accused of all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexico-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities there are.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of the hard times, they say.
Navorrett says Mexican Americans are a couple of worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico's capital, I barely went through the crowd and arrived in an area for the immigration agenda where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in high school California, and I've been called "Mexian" my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So later, I ended up with the name Mexican American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use the shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I have no word of a native spokesman, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my U.S. passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I've been thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peno visited President Obama's White House this week.
The programme had usual issues to be addressed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that the Mexicans remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neto promised to continue the Mexican drug cartel war even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader to translate half the Mexican territory into the United States under the threat of weapons.
But for the Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, they're all-inclusive.
So one minute after the U.S. representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids will go on a war trail.
And yet Mexico is the real challenge of a relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people whose countries offer opportunities, and others who don't.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often, than it would seem, this person would match the profile - dark leather, weak education, originating from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we live an American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look at us as a sub-prime race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bond to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is only about failure.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they would never have left him.
And now we wouldn't be found trapped in a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara, and she legally travelled to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is a tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Even though she's a United States citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either one.
We love to listen to Mexican groups, Los Tigress del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico, he looks at us as American.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence that I learned during my trip want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "providing ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and push on political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and extensive corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States, how they acted with Mexico before one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unvoice for how they were dealing with their family members in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The end of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings have been changed in ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, they captured missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropole, and at the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to have been stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed old order and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the region's ingenious chaos.
Maybe it will cause their fight to be bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their fatal pathology.
A war that's not even won or lost.
At first glance, there seems to be no reason for optimising at the moment.
Even if the ceasefires closed on November 21st, the fights this week will strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that Gaza has operated in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the world’s most irresistible and most people, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And, indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another Palestina bit, which is currently controlled by his engraving rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, leaders of Hamas can very well assume that time is on their side.
The Islamics all over the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that was once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, joined the Hamas side, and so did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Assembled people from Hamas say that the Islamic half of the month surrounds Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the party/milice of Hizboláh rule, through Syria, where rebels, who increasingly bow to Islamism, can settle Bashar Assad, until Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of Muslim Brotherhood has changed under the direction of President Muhammad Mursí in Egypt, far from the humanest and difficult Arab country, the balance in the region.
The Husní Mubárak, a secular depot that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and his leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, the Israeli hardline advocates will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli anti-raket system Iron dome has proved its prize and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unscrupulous as ever. Many European countries also blamed Hamas from the launch of the last round of violence.
And above all - Israel has flourished, especially under the direction of Benjamin Netanjahua, the Prime Minister, who has mostly ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from Gaza have been killed by about 30 Israelis since 2004, in Israel was relatively calm from suicide bombings, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might become Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements, which are still growing beyond their illegal law.
The Prime Minister Netanjah, whose Likud party, joined the election campaign on 22 January with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those pro-racial Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really were to rule the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like they did their countrymen in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit 'em when they pop their heads out.
Perhaps the hard lines will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although the Islamics who acquire power in Egypt and other countries do not have too much love for Israel, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenditure is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with local supervelms will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good sign and could be the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the denial of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination of the barrel with the powder, which must, one day, explode in areas occupied by Israel - as did the bus that went off in Tel Aviv last week.
Today, repressions are weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and demography, as the Arab population is growing.
Blood spills against Gaza every few years in order to press Hamas will increasingly collect diplomatic tax.
Both sides need outside support.
The answer is what wise people say on both sides, the majority of the outside world, and the following newspapers: two states when Israel will move the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that the withdrawal of fire will provide pressure from outside at least a little greater influence on the deployment of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to bet on stopping the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to convince Hamas to take the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also press on a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create the Palestinian State.
President Obama also has a piece on how to get Israel to the table.
During his first term of office, he left behind the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally angry in his entry into the process.
That's pathetic short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means peaceable settlement between Israel and Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packages have entered into force
A warning for smokers and sick parts of the body is displayed on unmarked green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands.
In effect, Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and logos and brand colours replaced with general olive green boxes with awful pictures of the sick parts of the body, and the appearance of children and newborns with the result of their parents’ smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, Saturdays are the only difference between boxes of marks that are printed in the same small letters.
This is the world's most stringent tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing this habit of attraction.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, 99% of the chance they'll never start smoking.
"And in very small children, you can see that you understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and quote studies that, for example, have shown that children associate a crown in the log with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbyed hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation there will be serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
The farmers from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products that will be sold on the Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Cabacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their appeal regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale sellers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible problem, experts point to the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, the online space is an insurmountable place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman noted an increase in the assessment of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by the "mean Honza".
Do we have to ask ourselves, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and he's got the job and he's made this video, or is marketing company involved?
The British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector focused on how it works with new regulations than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for assaulting new legislation - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is significantly traded.
The decision of SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has conducted talks with other governments that are considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws consider the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no influence on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back in," says Victor El Hage when you buy a box with photos of tumor in your mouth.
To be honest, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims it's harder for him to settle into the racks.
"It took me one hour to load the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we would say, "OK, that's the end, we close the shop," he said and tossed with hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last thanksgiving day I was unexpectedly spending five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It is quite annoying to wait half a day at the airport for the next flight, despite distractions by books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention due-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in children's development are increasingly coming with the praise of boredom.
They say it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we have no chance of boredom.
So should we support the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a rather new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Calgary University of Canada, which is the author of the Boredom book: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, she's bored with a long story," he said.
On the walls of Pompey there was a Latin inscription about boredom, coming from the first century of our flight.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and showing the idea of the target group, about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it".
The boredom of apathy distinguishes itself from the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would want to be.
He says there's no need for an apathy to do something.
He says the core of boredom is "the disturbance of the attention process associated with the bad mood and the feeling of the slowly running time."
Boring can be much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, boring people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Youth", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape the person read the article from the magazine.
Some of the groups heard a loud and non-connecting television program in the other room, others heard it so quiet that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported greater boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or reassuring task, it may cause a disturbance of attention to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neurons at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "such as finding bad parts on the factory line, a distracting music can help you not be afraid."
In fact, he said, now we know that turning and snoring, which he often looks at as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom fight and keep people physically more careful.
"The study shows that children who are allowed to drill will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all been bored ever - late my flight, banging speaker, especially a long movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of boredom than others.
To help measure boredom scientists in the 1980s, they developed a "Stupnica for boredom" (Bordom Transness Scale).
It includes questions such as, "There are many things I have to do, it's repeated and it's monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
With these scales, scientists have learned that boys tend to be bored more than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, the teenagers are generally unfathomable.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found 32 percent of teenagers bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage of boredom was now 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that "realing is the highest time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?"
How research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, people can lead to absurd physical risks, gambling or abuse habits as a way to ease them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nude is a way to tell you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, professor of psychology, NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it'll only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or manage himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain itself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical to her.
Our goal should be more comfortable when we are from the reach of constant crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment where we are constantly oversimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new law on marijuana
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high-school student and footballer from South-East Colorado, is facing charges against crimes for something that will soon be legal in the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and pipe he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one bright day he drove with some friends in Lamar on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - minor abuses for which every ticket is $100 - and the date for the court was set.
"They treated us as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the colorad vote on the legalization of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases is more likely than in law.
Hundreds of infringements for possession of marijuana have already been cancelled here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police department ceased to blame adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small quantity that will be legally authorised after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative districts of Colorado said they would continue with existing cases relating to marijuana, and still blame people for holding.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This issue is developing so quickly that I don't know what to do next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are also shrunk by regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first before most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of a license for the sale of Washington State alcohol.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will not be a state licensing system yet, but legal holding yes.
And there are strict mechanical questions that have to be resolved during this period, such as balancing the State Directive on "correction approach" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in hemps up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"No place will be more difficult to place a licensed trade of hemps than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle Metropolitan Region," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the legal hemp, recently established research groups.
On 21 November, the police chief Oates of Aurora sent his e-mail officers, in which he informed them that the city prosecutor would no longer be prosecuted for holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen of 21 years of age and that the police would stop the accusation of people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld district in northern Colorado, the District Attorney Ken Buck presents a tighter view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push on users to seek treatment.
At present, they are facing charges against the possession of 56 grams or less marijuana 119 people, even though many of them face further accusations.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal charges which have been criminally committed at the time when they occurred," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated in places like the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer accused adults of holding a small amount.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but he also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the colorad voters supported the measure, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counter-responsible response across the state has revealed, in view of this large state-wide green experiment, a deep conflict between local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesperson of the National Organization for Reforms regarding marijuana law.
"They spent so much of their lives chasing people, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states that face small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are best placed to become national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales and are also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will submit.
Despite several arrests of marijuana dealers for medical purposes and patients who use it, who drew attention to it, the federal government left mostly a medical marijuana deal in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While drug agents probably won't leave the door to capture a small drug bag, it is likely that they will allow regulated government trades with recreational marijuana permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former consultant in the field of drug policy of President Obama's administration.
Several colorad cities do not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana business, even if it takes about a year to open any trade.
Last week, the city of Montrose, in the west of the state, proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we give someone a licence, and then we're gonna have a big federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our village voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the village voted for, rather than what it voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I was a conservative."
Only university students are not attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember sometimes having to dream about college at Oxford.
Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest residence of knowledge, a modern echo of Greek symposium motivated by two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, I went to Worcester College two weeks after I wanted to study history, pack bags and go into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Enving Standard said I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said that I left because I was forced to drink from inflated cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this box of supposed lighting, it was both big and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was the supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right from Wednesday suffers from similar persecution.
Instituted and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students have been able to protect equal rights, such as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political opinions, they are "at times actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and they are made known not to be welcome".
They request the establishment of a position in the university Committee for equal opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary show BBC Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Teaching State: Young, Smart and Right) about a student political event, which conservatively referred to as weird and neo-Nazi.
The show introduced graduate Joe Cooke, former President of Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University) who drove Rolls-Roycec, was dressed in silver suit and had a stick with silver head.
In other colleges, conservative students say that they are treated for the introduction of higher education as "circumcised lambs".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), told Sunday news that "left influence on universities grows.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without ever meeting with us."
A 1-year-old history student on Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind a movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unfortunate" while the 19-year-old elected president of the AUCA Stephanie Cherillo says that the access of JCR members to people on the right from the center had worsened.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as does for the welfare of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I started in September 1986, 18-year-old and paralysing way of shying.
The hatred against the Conservative Party was the most serious.
A year earlier, the university voted against the award of an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in the funding of higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the steelists would have a little bit of fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students encounter each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the pelyňka who was supposed to come in.
I found that not only the professors of milk approve the sneezing of conservative pupils, but they also take part in the taste.
The policy of mining strike, privatisation and resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been brought into the wood of the observatory.
My first lecture involved the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I felt a lot of weight.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
"The wardens refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were moving.
I've been soaking tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, unless you are too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt concluded.
I went back to my room to my health.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I could feel a slight shoulder knock.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the UACA.
"I know who you are," he said nice.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who's suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative firsts pretend to be bourourism.
Later in a local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be failed.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics, and economics, who (the irony) went to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students had a record with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love?" asked one.
He beats each other, doesn't he?
I felt the way homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislation in the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similar thinkers only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a labist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed like a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, based on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote his speeches.
He wasn't even there.
The place hated it for its provinity and maliceness and for its tendency to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined the post of professor at the Bilkent University of Turkey in Ankara.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London looking for refuge with my unbiased Metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford, all political views were accepted in the '40s.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His dirty eyes got saddened.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance worsened.
My friend, also the supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness declared that I was "a stranger to the people" I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the middle of a study, I confessed that I had been brainwashed by "parents" and I called them "old fools".
The relief was only short-term.
The grave in my Oxford career hit my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns to Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I screamed inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a spooked weak one.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution subject to such intimidation and eating.
More tragic, though, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative premieres came, but which also hides into today for the undeserved reputation of places with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Fashion Champion" which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nate Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisova and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabel I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavani's exhibition.
This was confirmed by the designer during the opening of the celebration of "Valentino: Fashion Creation Master", which represents more than 130 models of top fashions created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," she says with her unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until 3 March, is used by private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from Vogher city in the north of Italy on the idol of the international "Bohemian Smetana".
To love the royal family is nothing wrong.
"At least you don't have a tiny piece of cigarette in a great carpet like it does some wonderful pop-music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy generously and with elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heiniho" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazzová performs Valentina
Nor does the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová forget charisma.
"It's been a lot of years since we went to see him at one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome for dinner.
There were twenty of us, and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger between us.
In every detail his apartment, decoration, food, music, in all things, he turned away and felt his spirit.
All invited were able to feel important and loved," recalls the top model, which started working with it during Paris’s week of high fashion in 1995.
"It never comes out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he ends.
The birth show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, it is a truly reinventory.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's galleries was converted into a personal 70-meter long passage which offers an exchange of role: a visitor will turn to a model and march on a passion to observe the "presence" of dreams, which Valentin's master's work as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was wearing Monica Vitti in "Nici" or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In the audience, names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophie habsburg.
Nate Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first love is "can't forget it".
"I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from a collection of autumn winter from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," said Nate Abascal, one of the designers' muse.
"I prefer him to others for his ex- Duchess and great love for women because he undermines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I like the colors that he uses, brightens and gives "the sparkle" to his face.
The props are perfect."
Neither Princess nor fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentine first dressed.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be full and have the opportunity to put on one of his evening clothes...
Eventually, she was 90 years old.
"I bought my first Valentine dress for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouarda de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with been called, covered with nutrients and a top without a frame.
It was a dream that became real," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is a lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains Italian aristocrat whose life lies between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's "very carefully... because dress isn't just a dress, it's also a set of memories they have in them".
"The King" of fashion
The golden ridge of the exhibition in Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greece in 1995.
In order to create these silk dresses of ivory color with full pearls, twelve types of different landscapes and a pin for a long four and a half metre were needed four months of work and 25 "hells" (as the designer calls his penthouse).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialised press, they represent the barbers of the top fashions of the late 20th century, the "return of clients from high society".
Valentino is now his best example during the years of the elite "savoir-être".
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (most honorable in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order The Honorary Legs acquires so much respect as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention was always attracted to his choice, calm, modified and perfect look," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at a table with Countess Jacquesine de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was great. Time left no trace of him."
When the princess says it...
The world's toughest craft: cheese carriers in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers in the field of Indonesian volcanoes and their life and health are gambling when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone pathways.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are people who are literally working in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijaya, one of the 400 miners, who earn the living of sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That's why they have to go down to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases escape from the inside of the Earth, and when contact with the air, they're going into a firm state.
After cutting off the large sulfur blocks, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, it takes them on the shoulder in two bamboo baskets to cover the stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but the exhausted carriers last for over 40 minutes before they rise up at an iron pace because they maintain a balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and falling into abysss.
They know that any squeaking could have happened to life, as it happened to one French tourist who crashed from the Kawah Ijen rock years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen make five cents per kilos of sulfur that make up
When they're up there, they take a road around tourists who photograph them like they're monkeys at circus, and they're tired of taking heavy baskets to a weight that the mining company has placed a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in a volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for a kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyramids, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whiteing sugar.
"Because he normally wears 70 pounds, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (€ 3.8) per trip," Anto explains to us, which usually takes three trips a day.
One journey takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupees (1.5 euros) per day.
Even if it seems to be a negligible amount of money for such inhuman effort, it's three times what he'd make in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees (€1.2) per day and pay for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who had previously worked on the island of Bali as a traitor.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's not breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes have irritable toxic gases.
In his 27 years Anto three times a day risks life in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur began to collect its tax on him, although his face is protected by special masks and glasses.
He's asthma, he's sick of breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes have irritable toxic gases that run out of volcanoes.
That's the price she must pay to achieve her dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French," she promises more than a dignified English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man affected by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of a carrier.
They share a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, and each day they get up at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur at night does not cease to grow and its characteristic yellow color is changed in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness of Anto into the crater and illuminates the path of a small lamp, which he has attached to the helmet and bought for himself for his money.
About 400 carriers carry on their shoulders baskets with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, sulfur mining has not mechanicalised due to cost savings, nor does it provide carriers working on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photoshopping supplement, which together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be selected by the security guards of the natural park from tourists who come to take photographs of the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, and not for humans," said Madrusin, the last 42-year-old who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can lift up up up to 110 kilos and make sure he can work as long as possible because he needs money to train his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulfur burns its throat and stings in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and plows the uppers in dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so saying that none of them complains that they suffer from severe illness... but it is obvious of their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthritis, knee pain and wound to the shoulders caused by weight of baskets.
In 53 years, an unainik who deduces his basket on his back can wear only 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his colleagues will grow up in the volcano of 15 tons of sulphur, which then three stones take the steep way between the mushrooms to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Out of his five sons, he is the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns sulfur mines.
The time is coming, but the steady poverty of one of the world's most difficult craftsmen persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporens say they don't have children, on careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
Singapore's inhabitants need growth.
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an ad to menthol candy, but yet - or maybe that's why - the video from the beginning of this year in Singapore spread to YouTube.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses the local bumping type of "we put a drum in the oven" as a mixture of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to alert the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people meet his "civil duty".
"It's all about the Internet stuff, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our population, so we felt that this is a topic we need to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things to expand the perfumes with pheromones or organise dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, "Why not do the most creative thing that's like rapping to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take too much lightly is a Singaporen government.
She spends $1300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city state with advanced technology in the south-east of Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the spread of the population is currently 1.2 of the child’s child’s birth rate.
Last year, the birth rate of 2, which is considered a degree of recovery, was overrun in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Head of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Authority for the People's Office, says it's because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities".
"So people have a wider range of options for life goals and priorities, it is not only wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the remarriage of marriage and child labor. As a result, the birth rate in Singapore is reduced.
While there was an effort to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as measures against the decline of population, it caused hatred among locals.
On some of the Singapore web sites, uncircumcised xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party of Singapore recorded its worst electoral result from the beginning of independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to deal with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there were also some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to make so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence property trade.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small flats known as "Bot crabs", which can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of EL Developers, claims that their "Bot crabs" are sold far faster than bigger houses.
"They're more popular, so that they sell for days up to weeks faster than houses with greater size.
That's why our cash flow is much better."
However, it admits that new standards establish clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, the talks with Singapore working in the financial district in the city center indicate that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, which is why many people postpone it," says the young official.
"The others have children.
But it's important to me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government's trying to force citizens to have children, they're the Singaporeans who have the last word to start a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal character or a "private life oblast that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does this definition apply in its daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger of being exposed when he publishes things on the Internet that he certainly would not say to anyone in common communication?
The newsmen from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as something completely personal and "user name and password" if it was a social network.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't publish," says Jorge ten-year-old in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I put pretty pictures or pictures on the FB as we play.
I'm talking to some friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a picture that wouldn't be mine or a picture that would make someone laugh," she says.
This boy realizes it's wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends who have on the FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
There's also a mother who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter so that I could express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving them up," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," she says.
Without hesitate, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if he was recommended by a stranger.
José's 14-year-old case is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask network and at the last mentioned network admits he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them set him up for anything, nor did he ask for his address or his phone number.
"If they insisted on me, or demanded from me, I will simply remove them from my account," admits.
José applied to Ask after he read his recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is not an alien experience with what is called cyberbulling today.
"The friends on the social network were blackmailing their friends.
They threatened him and asked him for money.
He never knew who it was," confirmed.
According to José's account, the victim didn't check out.
"Only one activated a private regime."
Then it explains the series of steps how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos known in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if I were concerned or if I wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbulling," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, considers that children and adolescents in social networks must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
He states that "Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogue at Yale University and author of the article Digital adults and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, to publish and to say, and what is not, at the age when they are not hurt."
Also, in order to be - in terms of the surroundings - discreet, at a time when what he desires most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras names some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like someone to publish your picture as you published your friend?
You know what the rest of you are saying?
When you mark people in the party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: They all need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to act in the Internet environment as well as beyond it.
They're the same rules.
"The man outside the Internet is governed by respect, moral and other principles, and this should be the same on social networks," he says.
On behalf of the President, the Commission shall:
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, teacher at first level and education counselor explains that it is necessary for parents to read carefully the rules of social networks.
"If they understand the individual deities, they have a good basis to talk to the children about the consequences that an online account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "do not speak to strangers".
The summit of South America ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without being issued the Declaration of Lima, which was examined and allegedly signed by seven Presidents.
The Agency of Efe repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the representatives of the State Department and the Presidential Office, who had established at the beginning that the document would be published after the summit, said that it would be published later on the web page of the Peruvian Government.
They also stated that the contents were published by Peruan President Ollanta Humalou in several short press releases.
The reporters had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without a sounding of the "confidential meeting, audio transmission missing".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some governments who were present but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants with presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruan president's media office sent an e-mail with a "final statement" from the summit, but it's just the statement of President Humala, not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Paies Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion it was not originally promised the Declaration of Lima, although it was filed with the press hotly required.
An ASPA official website can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prohibit the provision of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which addresses the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñer met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which will begin to discuss the dispute against Santiago on Monday by hearing the defence speech both sides.
"We will take a look at and execute a judgment that will solve a dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humal, together with his Chinese counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñer, and greeted President Humal with a handprint at the flag of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they were subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia's adoption of the Bogoth Pact this week, which expressed its submission to the judgments of the International Court, which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be entirely incorrect.
The Summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organisation in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernanda Luga and the meeting was not attended.
The Hostant President Ollant Humal was appointed to launch early speeches and close the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements had been agreed and 31 projects were planned between the South American countries, with investments worth $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the non-SUR Member States would take "a major step towards a goal in the form of a South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions were supported to improve "co-operation in combating civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to better availability of drugs and cheap internet in all areas of South America and to effective joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in a crisis, "it is not to have economic consolidation (Latin America) of a winning nature, but to serve to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," Humal said.
"We decided to prefer a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different locations of South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more connected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President.
He mentioned that five of these projects were related to Peru and to the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to a better link with Ecuador, but did not mention more detail.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguaya.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of the South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is comprehensive and has good neighbouring relations.
In this sense, President Juan Manuel Santos said that he was hoping to meet on Saturday in Mexico with his Nigerian counterpart Daniel Ortego to discuss, in respect of the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute on the maritime border, which is challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow (on Saturday)" said Santos.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor an agreement with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortego that we should be able to lead the negotiations as civilised and as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they will attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
In the framework of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers have provisionally gathered to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the area.
The UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paradise, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn to integrate from Europe
The Ecuadorn President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "with South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of the Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared in the State TV Perú that Europeans "killed for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he initiated a project to create a South American citizenship that the Member States support Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place between the Andean Community, but there are still reverse areas that want us back to the past," he pointed out.
The Ecuadorn President expressed his agreement, inter alia, to regroup the United States Organisation (OAS) on condition that the impact of the English States will be reduced and that those who have signed the San José Pact will be taken into account.
"They who are in the forehead are never bound to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is financed by the United States in Washington," said he in a convert to political asylum provided by the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange might be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized Swedish judicials who asked him to be questioned on the Swedish territory because of alleged sexual delicacy, with "in its own Swedish legislation allowing for the interview by a videoconference call that might take place from the Ecuadorn embassy in London".
Correa said that there is a risk that physical and mental health and health will get worse in Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of the state.
"But its physical and psychological state is getting worse because it is closed in a small space without being able to move on fresh air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to asylum provided to Assange from June to the Ecuador embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the talks had been held with London in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been talks all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in different European instances," he said.
He said, "if Britain gives out a pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or through Skype, how without a problem this allows for legislation there and as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be the end of the problem."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defenseman of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly does not tolerate "priority, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the underground and the degenerate politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that even such journalists, "not the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, do not control Ecuador", and he said that if he was elected again, "he will continue to change the right path and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain, in terms of membership in the Unasur Union, at least until her next elections and argued that the whole "must be strong and not tolerated by opportunism and pucism wrapped into legality" because, in fact, he "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorn President stated that he considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, following the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which he had decided in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will must be crossed together.
They need to be evaluated widely in order to overcome and to be able to go forward."
He also expressed his hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute which deals with Peru and Chile in the same judgment and expressed his view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to take judgment, however hard".
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to take place in order of the third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he lost his election in February 2013, he would leave the public life.
"I have never personally cared about power, but so unfair as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be managed by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave the politics.
If we lose, I'll be the same.
I've decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Vice President Nicolás Madur who says President Chávez went to a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign.
This is not the president's medical recession," he explained.
The Head of Ecuador State has today attended the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which has been concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the consequence of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning hit me," tells me in the memories of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "lighten a little bit," but clearly without success.
The boy kept it from the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own to his bed, and he started to inform about it, and with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients in HIV units at the Civilian Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several fears of illness.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, a few options for treatment and a greater stigma.
At that time neither the Director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) was dissected with him, "because he had a cut wound."
That's when AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their illness and lose, except when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system and then they become victims of accidental infection.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "has seen great success that the length of life of the patient who starts with treatment in time and in an appropriate manner is the same as in healthy people" said Jaime Andrad Villanueva, head of HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist on HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and full life are dependent on the level of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, and those who do not use drugs are better at it: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
This simply means that the one who is diagnosed in 25 years of age may, according to these findings, live without problems until 75 years of treatment, explain to the doctor in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is appropriate to mention that the average life span of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and in Mexico the number of people who died of AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UN/AIDS-UNAIDS Joint Programme) is also true that 60 percent of patients died from AIDS detection.
Only in the State of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and until this May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die for the consequences of the disease?
- "I don't think the problem is in terms of access to treatment.
That's how I see it. This is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't exhausted supplies of drugs. The problem is that patients are coming to a very advanced stage because they don't know the disease, or at the late stage of the disease."
It adds a persuasive point: " Nine of ten patients come when some associated infection is manifested. The only thing we need to do is to be able to affect the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests on the detection of the disease to all those who apply for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco and patients like Fabrizio, who came to test for a private laboratory only because he did it to his friend, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS disease and also suffered Kaposi’s sarcom, cancer disease which is one of the usual complications.
"It all changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm to die, I'd rather do three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy eat, exercise, I take medication."
To this day his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO's diary to motivate those who are afraid today in the framework of the World Day of AIDS.
"Let them take the test, so if they risked, let them know if they're positive as soon as possible, it's better, and if they've already been diagnosed, whatever they realize they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the AIDS battles this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalaiar journalist, who is looking for information about HIV virus.
And the greatest gaps are in prevention.
In those places that are devoted to this task, "we have actually increased the issue of condoms, they have previously given us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who have no access to condoms," he said.
Teens are among the most vulnerable to new diseases.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school advisers, pharmacies and medical staff who want to avoid themselves, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective separation, let condoms not be just behind the counter, but let them be in the donors in the public bathrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
It's not about paying them a beer and a motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he'd agree to divide the predators in his district.
The best is to make condoms available to those who have already led sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
13 435 cases were reported (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This condition means fourth place in Mexico in new and established cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the diseases take place on a sexual basis, 6% of the blood route y 2% on a perennial basis.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the U.S. appeal court, which does not recognise the restructuring of Group Vitro's debt as established by a competition in Mexico, raises an impeccable precedent for any national agency with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solarity.
Thus, it appears that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws, the land of lanes and stars, despite international agreements, do not apply.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Hal in a competitive court for North Texas leaving in practice Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscated their assets on the second bank of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the door to the United States Supreme Court with appeal against three irregularities.
At first, it must be said that while the judge of this cauzy claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States' insolvency law, the Court of First Instance of the Fifth period based in New Orleans says that the main procedure is to establish a competitive procedure in Mexico.
First, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvence of transnational enterprises.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created to determine the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the branch of the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro is recognised against the branches, the requested majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility of Mexican laws admits.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agreex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Competition Institute ruled in debt.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. the funds of "suptures", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convertgencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached most.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal does not consider this in question.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro from the difficult situation it faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company Gonzáleze Sada will call for a new assessment directly at the appealing court in order for the assessment to take place for full participation, i.e. with five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If he does not succeed here, he will be required to review the higher instance process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
It is important that the court has forgotten the document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of the Amicus Curiae, in which it is detailed in the procedure of Vitro in the framework of the Convention and which points out that the company has made it easier for the company to adapt to agreements signed by both countries to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvent Law.
Furthermore, it points out that the country has followed the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, this is the rules for international insolvence cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Without notice, there were several months of criminal notice from the Mexican Aviation Department against the former owner of Gastón Azcarrag Andrad, who was ordered from the fraudulent conduct, and, according to the expert organisation of the vessel pilots, has already passed over.
The case led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed an action against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he blames with the obstruction of obtaining justice.
According to the audit, the Authority has systematically refused to report to the General Protection Office of the Republic of the transaction carried out by that trader, where F/589 F/589 was chosen on behalf of the Mexican aviation company 1998 million pesos.
The premises were probably directed towards buying a Professional Hotel Management Share (Adradora Professional de Hotels).
As known, Azcarraga Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posadas hotels chain.
Receipt Dragon Martu
In Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens, who approved the creation of a association, met on weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Martu in Kankuun.
We are talking about a huge commercial and distribution centre with products from the "great wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which in the lower part would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has previously been able to unite the governors of the south-east zone to counter the monumental area, which would partially de-deposit protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of matter with ACTA
The request of the Senate, which was not taken by the Government in question and which requested an explanation under what conditions and circumstances in Japan, was signed by the Mexican Ambassador of the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English shortcut ACTA, under the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Proped Industrial), has remained up-to-date.
As is known, it has been so despite the fact that the Senate has ruled out the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The Basketball was my life"
The Basketball Worlds Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been linked to this hall sport for more than 60 years and has processed the whole world because of him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a lot of memories of local basketball history, such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was set on a wheelchair chair in 2008 for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a national basketball player BSN, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in a national basketball league or the president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I stayed a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several simultaneously, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the CEO of the National Team and the Chairman of the Federation," recalled Reyes when he visited Primer Hora's news reporters at home in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel for over 50 years, his loyal wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes does not expel in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and alarm objects from his long career, testify to that.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest move from all the roofs, those who resemble his action in the lot of Vaqueros from the mid 1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best summer, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships since 1967, either as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one championship -- in 1981, when in BSN he debuted Jerome Mincy.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who had previously been a coach here and worked at the Alabama University of Birmingham for that time, said to me, "I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico's ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to play the Raymond Gausse player who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon's victory in the championship, Gausse will then contribute to the next."
The Champion, when he played Gausse for the Vaqueros, was enjoying himself, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time he wanted to fully serve his functions and enjoy the Mincy location in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifying Olympic game in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Championship, where we ended up fourth, but we should have the bronze not be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throwing," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in Panameric Games in Cuba 1991 when we won gold and we robbed a United States Man, which was quite similar to that that that blew up our bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivas, Fica Lópeze and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León's brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but he was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy was a man of Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentinean Neuquen.
With players on the Soups, like they were "Canito" Nevers, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourr, who replaced players excluded from the fight in Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from the international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has reached such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his action in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best port coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julia Toro, Florelledez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Young people like Leo Arill's work very much.
What success do you consider the federation to be the biggest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team in the years 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, BSN had a national league in one season to 17 men.
What didn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by the regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their own area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of mandatory certificates and courses for trainers, referee assistants and referee.
Nice to meet you.
What do you do now?
Mostly listening to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying my grandkids and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, at Forth Worth in Texas, was world-renowned by the major roles of John Ross Ewinga, more known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which the man, who acted carelessly and manipulatively.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the precious oil magnate J.R. Ewinga in the Dallas TV series became the symbol of the lacquet in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official announcement of the family that the Associated Press agency provided the production company of Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town, Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time she died in the hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
The Hagman diagnosed liver circulation in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found a depleted tumor in the liver and Hagman was transplanted.
In the summer before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated on TV as a decent guy in a light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, the astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (the jinn) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedyes that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His action in films included roles that were well accepted by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and the Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repellent J.R. that led him to the starboard top.
The CBS Dramatic series of the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propagation slogan, "Who shot Periár?" which was supposed to cause expectations about the work of an emotional, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped to achieve a record of follow-up.
The 1980 November episode, in which the response was revealed, followed on average 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most monitored entertainment programme of history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million viewers.
J.R. fired his sister-in-law Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played the Ewinga, an insatiable greedist with a charismatic smile: a meek businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) who was an alcoholic, was closed into a treatment.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone", said Hagman in 1988.
There should be, "Here's an honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "light on canvas and off."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of us all who were so happy to know him and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"It was already finished shooting five parts of the second row and the sixth one was just rolling," the television station informed.
In the middle of Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner nor from TNT station about how the series will continue.
A parent from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who lit in classical parts such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 1950s Larry tried his luck on theatre scenes in New York and then served in England at the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time.
In 2001 he released the autobiography book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm someone," said Agent Prens Asociad back then.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, helping combat patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "do not worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
A course begins that examines the end of the world
Every week students explore apocalypse such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to do a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Maya calendar to come December 21st, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what he was expected in several months: the Catastrophal hurricane Sandy, a budgetary gap that some call the 'long Armageddon', and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, a place where, according to the Christians, theorists of the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most common semester ever," Charmé told the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
It's a really good time when a person takes apart what's going on in the world today.
And remember, bad means good for apocalypse.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Barry Vacker holds an assistant at Barry Vacker's "Procentres, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students explore apocalypse such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these thoughts are expanding with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war can go off.
This month, students analyze film with apocalypse and examine how different they are from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, believing and impossible," says Vacker.
The professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Sorari, a professional assistant to art history and anthropology, together with the simple name of the End of the world.
"We don't connect "2012" because we always count on the possibility to arrange the course again in case the world doesn't end up," Restall said.
Despite the "hazardous destruction" the students must study, create projects and make final exams.
On Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the evening of the anticipated end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread into two hours," Restall said about his course for students with high averages that applied for 35.
Week and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if there is still room.
Students themselves make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23-year-old Brigid Robinson, student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Thus, apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursery student, said he saw all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no questionable student, let alone the professor, said he believed in the end date on 21 December.
"Our first project discussed mayan predictions and in a certain way we throw it out," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple University of West Chester.
"Mayes never foretold the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back a few centuries, which people react to changing their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The development of these speculation has caused the Internet.
"Jine doesn't think about it," he said.
It happens in absolutely most of the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at La Salle University, who presented this year in the Philippines, asked if he knew there was a course about the end of the world, answered quickly.
"Filipins do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the Supreme Bureau.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, many of the last days of the court were discussed, and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin to think immediately about the next date" or philosophy that December 21st is the beginning of the seven-year period, at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken by students and professors lightly.
Several said they were going to go to the end of the world.
"I think I'll call some of my friends to laugh," explained Samir Ford's 20-year-old communication student.
