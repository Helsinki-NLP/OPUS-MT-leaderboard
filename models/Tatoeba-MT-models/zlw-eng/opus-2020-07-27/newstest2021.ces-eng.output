The well-protected cave in the forest at New Bora wasn't really present.
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of Lužice Mountains, near New Boru in Czechoslovakia, in the forests leading the Counting Path, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're going under that human hand created.
The room is called the cave at the deserter.
In fact, there was never a man here who lived here, and the cave served as a hideout, more precisely the hideout chamber appears to be on the grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock guard and accessible by stairs from above.
But it's almost impossible to see until the last moment.
It will reveal it up to the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery where it only enters the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is very far from human dwellings, at the time of creation it could have been on the mountain platform where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object has no window and neither in the traditional place of the place placed in the penitentiary clearly proves that there could never have survived the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts Jan Evangelista Purky, Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench serving probably to postpone the container.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There's some trace of instruments on the cave walls.
It was easy and fast for people to break the sand off with the tip.
It was enough to use the clutches and sandstones to gradually break away.
According to the foot length of the tip, and in any way the mowing can be established in a frame of time of cave formation.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, there are sometimes sleepers.
If you approach the cave from one of the roads of the forest and take you under the cave running pits and a nearby Countess road, you will surely find a way down also.
And by the way of the forest, you may still be caught by the nearby Havran Rocks.
Lone Minařík is after a heavy fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Filip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is on similar cases, and we have a lot of family in Hannover.
This greatly makes the situation easier and also the care of the daughter of Finju," quoted the server Jests.cz of the statement of Minaříkov's wife Katji.
"All of them do maximum, Philip needs time to reconvalescence.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem with head trauma and artificial sleep patients knows that the situation can change.
Philip's a big fighter.
Now we must all be patient and give him time," said the woman of the 45 - year - old gill.
For financial support from the wounded Minařík, he called on the twitter and the star Frankie Dettori, who won the late King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stokes on Saturday in Ascot, equaling the legend of Lester Piggott.
On Gorindme server today, nearly 70,000 euros have been selected.
The aim is to amount EUR 100 000 (EUR 2.6 million).
The referee took four goals to the Sassuola football players, lost 0:2
The Sassuola football players, although in the Saturday match at Naples, got the ball to the opponent's goal four times, but eventually they had to deal with the defeat of 0:2.
Neither one of their goals will decide after consultation of the video because of the loss.
According to the Italian media, it's a record dissatisfaction technology, so many interventions have never seen one team freeze.
"VAR was more stringent on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him as yet no team.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in the comment.
"Festival of unfamiliar goals of Sassuola.
He has never been so strict with one team," he added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday in 8 minutes, but after half an hour of the game, it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Philip Diuričič was not recognized after the video hit by a referee.
For the same reason, Djurich’s intervention and shots of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi did not gradually pay.
On the contrary, they added one more goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most recent
"The growth was as much as a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend in more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-auts," said the Head of CEZ Chmík.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, are reporting their part on the market, including the manufacturer of Tesla electrics, but also the Bill and Lidl supermarkets.
The operator of classic pumping stations is again represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
"We only started building our electricity network last year," explained Jan Jusková.
However, the Editorial Editorial of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric standers operated by ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers from the stations took on average 13.5 kWh.
It corresponds to an arrival of about a hundred kilometres of smaller electromobility.
If we skip small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists have already paid, their typical cost was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility extends mainly in the capital.
In Prague, there are all five most difficult chargers of ČEZ, which are popularly popularly used by the whole regional city.
Olomouc leads between regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is the remote station in border lines, such as Bohumín or Prachatica, which often remain all day long without use.
There are currently more than four thousand electromobiles registered in the Czech Republic.
This year's first half came 1274 new e-auts.
In the extensive survey of Diník "Czechs in Movement" eight percent of readers said that the purchase of electromobility into the family considered.
Only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their surroundings.
Not only for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the current steps of the government on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers invited the state to adopt a more reputable approach.
The action entitled Last drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as Duha, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who have been performing long-term counter-expansion at the lower end of Tura, there are people who are anti-scrap mining at the Uherské Ostrohu," said Marika Volf.
It stated that the main requirements of protesters are the establishment of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a significant change in agricultural policy and a subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of people, not a carefree and devastationing business," she said.
On the Malostranské náměstí there was a stand with a petition inviting representatives of the Czech state to base themselves on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech land and landscapes.
People of this world were equipped with banners with helly like "The end of the beet board" or "the mine of coal, more of the bean."
From southern Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda from the Group came to Prague for water for people who protested against the plan of fissure mining in Hodonínsk.
"It threatens the supply of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that drills represent the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to the planned fission mining, it is only about 500 metres from the drills and according to the judgements it is certain that water quality will be at risk.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valec in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to small pharaohs that are not made for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"The small agro-ecological farms are able to completely feed the entire population, and they do not make such a ruin in rural and environmental form," he said.
Three people died in the fall of a plane on a house in Germany
In the fall of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment house in West Germany, three people died today and the other two were injured.
They informed the local rescue forces, according to which there are probably two crew members between the dead and one resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The undercrowding apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the house, subsequently captured the fire.
Firemen have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Chief of Local Firemen Robert Meyboom said that they had apparently died both of the crew.
Third victim, according to the police, is the woman who lived in the house.
The journal Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that it was a mother of a self-lifer whose two-year-old daughter was saved from the apartment with minor injuries.
There was an emergency parachute found near the crash, which probably served as a brake when landing.
The police are coming from an emergency plane.
There were two people in the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post with an eyewitness's appeal said that before the crash, the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ's appeal to other witnesses wrote that the plane fell off in the air before the impact of the earth.

The exact number of clients that the bank has decommitted from card payments twice, the spokesperson of the bank does not know, according to its estimate, was less than thousands of transactions.
The cause of the savings is found.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," Kropik said.
The Czech savings company is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings company is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.

Most diseases are mild, only three percent of infected people must be in hospital
The Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavirus, or our summer dose of sun has significantly improved immunity.
Hospital infection is half empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is quite different and it is primarily given by the number of hospitalised people," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that April 11, when the first wave of epidemics came up with us, they carried all the pelts, they carried the army, the Republic was closed, and the Czechs used disinfectants a year ahead.
Yet, ten people died a day.
Now, daily increases are higher in the number of infected, but every day they die of maximum two people.
The highest number of infected people still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already has Jihlava due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer’s centre, where there are 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors closed the hygiene room in Černotice in Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests with one of the nurses.
"We are, we have reduced movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of seniors Martin Schážał.
According to him, none of his clients have any symptoms of disease yet.
Discontinuation tests begin to implement hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals also respond to an increased number of infected patients.
The Oncology Institute in Brno has launched an automatic camera system at the entrance to see if people have a pouch on their way in.
The record reports the Southern hygieneist, who recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the dust company.
Overall, it came for Saturday 131 infected - that is, half of the Friday number - but it is less tested on weekends.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson wet.
The big surprise tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated excellent performance even in a fight with a player who won the second most prestigious business within the PDC in 2018.
The initial match was two-sided, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian arrow.
Van den Bergh married his brother with a 13-and-a-half leg, and he's been on top since then.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and significantly more experienced "Scotting Scots" is just hard to get to the doables.
About the way he had "The Dream Creator" in his hand, it also shows that Anderson played his first best in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed a great checkout.
Last time he was in his eleventh leg, he was in bad shape, but he caught a big fish and closed 170.
At the end of the match, there was a huge frustration at Anderson.
The arrows were more like throwing away and his triumphing opponents were starting completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three mothers of gifts and finished his name - wrote his great dream.
Profit of trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian arrows that it's his first winning major.
It is still true that Karel Sedláček is the last player who could beat van day Bergha.
In Nantes, there was an accusation against the cathedral fire, a man confessed.
The Department of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began burning last Saturday and the fire really damaged the original vitrage windows of the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspected of the arson investigators checked because the fire was progressing with a temple of three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrance didn't find any indication that someone would get into the cathedral with violence.
The accused is a volunteer in the local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwandan fugitive.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without a criminal prosecution.
Now the D.A. has informed that, on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested on Saturday again, admitted and facing charges against the arson.
In case he's found guilty, he's in danger of up to ten years of prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets action and decides to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce "seafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is designed to serve as a pandemic plan, for which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"They will, according to the power of community dissemination," explained the Minister.
He added that today, for example, the Moravian-Silezský kraj or Prague would reach the intermediate, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, it added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and Department of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
The Minister considers that specific measures will be applied according to each step, whether they are required to wear cloths or to organise special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan on TV Prima Partie, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalised ones remains low.
Vojtěch commented that there was nothing crucial going on about the announcement of an extraordinary condition or the rescinding of a crisis staff.
The government has once again introduced an obligation to carry worms on internal events of over 100 people in the Czech Republic with regard to the growing number of infected Saturdays in the whole of the Czech Republic.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced to 500 people, now account for 1000 people.
The government procedure, when it has not been clear until the last moment, what measures have been taken, and when they will pay, and when they will be announced, they have met the criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is rather tight, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and, on the contrary, the confusion is to be compared," said Senator Marek Hilšer.
The measures may already differ according to the region, for example in Prague, the obligation to wear puddles from Sunday to non-stay medical devices, for example in pharmacys or waiting rooms with a physician.
The obligation to wear cleavages when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies also introduced from Friday in Liberec and the Ústí Region.
In the University of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear peas in internal public spaces, in the MDD and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian Region, as in the Mediterranean region of Kutnohorsk.
The Czech Government has already approved a so-called semafor for Europe at the beginning of June, which colourfully distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For countries with low and medium-risk authorities since 15 June, the Czech citizens have not required a negative test on the coronavirus or are not in charge of quarantine.
They are compulsory for the Czechs to return from high-risk countries.
At this moment, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.
Technology in Warsaw continues.
She's playing the third power, she's supposed to end up at noon.
Háčková Lhota (Benšovsko) Technology at Hlaváčková Lhota in Benecko continues on Sunday night.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the police's evening estimates here after 20:00, about 500 people remain, the original gross estimates talked about three hundred, they were at 900 in the morning, said police spokesman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techoparty would end up on Sundays noon, at that time actually some of the music systems were quiet.
"Some of them have left, and others are about to leave.
Music production is partly ongoing.
We expect it to gradually come to the disconnection and disassembly of music systems," Nováková said.
"Policemen are still constantly in control of leaving visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or habits.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers in charge of the event, foreign police, transport and order police are on site, and there are also psocs with service dogs in the emergency room.
"In the wake of today, police officers checked 470 people moving in the place of action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of which were behind the alcohol steering wheel," Nováková said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested for the presence of hallucinatory and psychotropic substances, one positive.
The police also handled 14 misdemeanors in transport.
At the request of the participants, the technparty police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of hallucinative and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were in action on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't been down, the police would have hit it.
On TV, Prima Partie told the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor was it requested by the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health.
The Czech TV (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparty extended to the surrounding land the owners of which did not agree with the use of technology.
It is possible that the owners of surrounding land will demand compensation.
The tech props on the meadow at Hlaváčkovy Lhota arrived Friday night.
The police originally watched the meadow in Blažimi, Warsaw, on Friday, where the techoparty took place last year.
Blajim is located approximately 30 kilometres from Hlaváčková Lhota, where the technicians eventually went down.
According to New York City, no one came to Blažimi.
The baby ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded on the Iron Island.
She plays in the leg with a girl, the 2010 year that the parents brought themselves to that rescue service base," she told Deník regional spokesperson Mária Svobodová, who then transferred the child to the hospital in Klatov.
It is the only poison snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Czech Republic that these animals occur in a higher number, and it is therefore good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that you'll get evicted isn't too high when you get used to it.
And if she's got room for it, she likes to go away for louding.
They will only attack if they feel at risk - for example if you step on it by mistake.
It is not a tragedy, though, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if you have a particularly weakened organism or suffer from allergy.
Therefore, the risk of danger is primarily in children, seniors and allergics.
"The man has often a feeling of vomiting, sweat, has increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and particularly allergics can occur to anaphylact shock," she described for Diník Miriam Gred from Klatov Hospital.
A man threatened to throw away a baby from a window.
After a cop pouring wine and throwing dishes
After 11:00, she broke into the intervention unit's apartment, and the men were arrested.
Kojence immediately took over the care of healthcare professionals, the spokesperson of the regional police Markéta Janovská reported in the press release.
A man didn't want to cooperate with the police, throw away dishes, knives, or pour it out of the wine window.
Many times during the negotiations, he was able to convince the child in his arms that he was leaning out of the window.
One day, he even went up to the window parapet, where he threw himself.
The man's police are still investigating.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.

Sappa: Razia revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1320 pieces of silica eggs of unknown origin, in addition in inappropriate conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in the establishment," said the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was then found that the dealer had no proof of origin and was not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from the veterinary perspective for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, vets discovered an illegal food store, with almost half a tonne of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
Most were unable to determine the date of consumption, part of the product had passed the period of durability and was damaged.
For five kilograms of semen, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with police in the area of the market had been arrested for 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, with a portion of which were polluted.
Putin telephoned the Greens before opening the truce in Donbas, Kremlin criticises the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymym Greensky about the situation in Donbas from midnight to start paying a new truce.
Putin, according to the Kremlin declaration, criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to take local elections; Kyjev informed that Zelessky called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new calming of weapons on Wednesday evening with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The aim is to start after midnight on Monday night, to be "full and general" and to open the way to meet other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin in an interview with the Greens said that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections was against the peace agreement with Minsk and threatens the prospects for settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament decided last week that the current elections to local representatives will not take place in the territory of the pro-russian rebels.
The Mint Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain its return under the control of the Ukrainian border of the occupied Separatists with Russia after providing them with broad autonomy and will organise local elections here.
According to the Union’s Green Office, both states agreed on the benefit of the upcoming truce in Donbas and on the need to carry out further measures to support peace in this region, such as the depreciation of areas of fighting or the withdrawal of parts of units from the front.
Zelesky also called on Putin to release the Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped stop the fight, but people are still dying on both sides of the front in occasional firefighting and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has requested over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West are accusing Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denyes.
Zelesskyj made his priority from the end of the war in Donbas, but has not yet been a major breakthrough.
An unexpected master in the 10th century is Rykl, the 7th reigned by Novotná
Defenders of the last two titles Doležal failed to conclude the Saturday program of four hundred, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.

Another medal was won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, he reminded Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkory's absence.
"It's too bad the guys weren't here and Kope didn't start because it would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I appreciate especially the fact that I had a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I got a little bit more excited, and I guess I got disappointed in the hard drive, and I was just undersized there," he admitted on the union facebook.
The first day she won more than a hundred-point advantage of Kateřina Cach, even though she was tormented by a wounded ankle on her reflective leg.
However, in the remote sector, it was then written only 570 cm, and it did not pass 40 meters and entered the final osmist.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvořák.
The distance came out, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wished it was around 630.
Yesterday, I started pulling sticks, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't make me feel any better," Novotná said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
The liquefied oil gas, the short-circuit LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its substantially lower price compared to gas or high-priced, with significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically grey variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is a whole new one - the European market first appeared before and in the Czech Republic according to the press release of the Czech LPG association arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we received the first 15 tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station by Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, a number of motorists are now in line with the classic oil LPG that can be used in their cars.
Therefore it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association.
This is also said to be one of the major advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, as well as distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and cane cane.
In the future, they should also be produced on a targeted basis, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, the classic oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product for the refining of oil, partly by separation in natural gas mining.
Thus, the result is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
This is not the issue of CO2 emissions from the exhaust car but on the environmental of fuel production, i.e. part of the "well-to-tank" (from the source to the tank).
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG is currently one of Eni's petrochemical companies, Total and Neste.
According to recent updates of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also examines the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of association in the Czech Republic, some 170 000 vehicles run to the LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, approximately 200,000.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Transport, nearly 6 000 conversions of cars to LPG have been carried out last year only.
In the Czech Republic, it is possible to fuel LPG at about 950 stations of different operators.

Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for pandemic
In order to be able to vote in October’s regional and senate elections, people in quarantine due to coronavirus, according to the vice Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáč (ČSSD), need to change law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He did it on Sundays on the TV party Prima.
On Tuesday he wants to discuss a possible solution with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"If we do anything, it will have to change the election law," Hamáček said.
The Senate invited the government on Wednesday to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine because of health reasons cannot vote.
The prohibition should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current proposal of the law, which is in the House, is followed by its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election overvalued.
Personally, it is against the possibilities of electronic voting where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now ad hoc mechanisms (voleb) need to be developed, which could already be achieved this year and with as little a health risk as possible.
It considers it essential to be ready for 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be made in the Czech Republic.
The correspondence option (though only in foreign or also in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As others, they see the election forces already mentioned, or, for example, the possibility of a public vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how to do such situations - the choice at the time of coronavir - addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus diseases, various types of elections have been postponed this year in 67 countries.
Protests in Buharsk: Prague ears have thrown demonstrators at the building of government
The participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojk Borisov and his cabin were wearing pig ears at the building of the government.
It was another series of protests against the 'Mafian style of rule' that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning at the center of the national block, said the DPA agency.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day after which, according to the Radio Free Europe/Rádio Freedom station, had a weaker participation than the previous one.
About 300 people met at 20:00, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the government were playing a theatre scene in which they symbolically closed in the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The reference of both belongs to the essential requirements of protestors.
They also called for the abolition of the declared health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The protest organizer Nikolai Hadžigenov said today in public radio today that on Wednesday, "the top escalation" in the form of "national manifestations in Sofia and Blocks in the whole country".
He repeated his demand to resign Boris and his government, as well as his early elections.
Those proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had already told us that he was an accident.
This has justified, among other things, the necessity of making Bulgaria a pandemic of covidu-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, even though the protesters did not calm down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government stood in parliament to vote on trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants to fight without viewers
Coach of football players Boloni Siniš Mihajlovič already has enough games for Italian leagues without audiences.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running right now is not football.
I'm sick of playing games without the audience.
It's sexual football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks it," Mikajlovič said before today's fight against Lecke.
Following the coronavirus pauses of Syria and in a fast sequence, and even though they play until night, their actors are exposed to hotness.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
In such conditions, they won't know how the teams are.
It's time for this season to end.
The measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that since September the fans will be back," said the coach who had led Fiorent or AC Milan in the past.
This season is unusual for Mihajlov's because four months were missing on the bench due to the treatment of the leukoemia.
"In spite of my illness, the league break and everything else, our team went up to a level.
We want to grow further, and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iran’s military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, fabrik and businesses.
Some Iranian agents said that this month's fire that broke into the underground nuclear operation in Natanzu could cause cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesperson of Iran's State Department of Abas Musáví told journalists according to Iran's media that the Islamic Republic infrastructure is facing "thousands of cyber attacks".
He added that it wasn't a new phenomenon and that most of them would be able to reflect.
In recent months, according to Musaví, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, followed by an analysis of the "specific governments and groups".
However, no further details of possible perpetrators were provided by Reuters.
He also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
This month, the article of Iranian state agency IRNA discussed the fact that enemies of Iran, like Israel and the US, could have been behind recent incidents.
Neither of these countries was charged directly with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and 444 days held hostage 52 Americans.
Long-term tight relations between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world, and introduced sanctions against Iran which have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the American army killed Iran's general Kasem Solyming, and a member of the leading Iraqi love of Abu Mahdi Muhammadise.
Iran then fired on January 8 at the base in Iraq, where Americans act, the amount of missiles.
The U.S., with distance, admitted that dozens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is the main opponent of an international nuclear agreement with Iran of 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.

So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostel.
"In the past two months, we didn't have to deal with almost no problem," Kašpar said.
For example, the Youngoboleslav Škoda Auto, which also cut off its production due to the kronavirus crisis, renewed it on Monday, 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the races works at 100 percent of the capacity.
More than 80 hygiene measures were accompanied by the restoration of production in Scotland.

Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
For more than two years she'd been struggling with Gemma Sisson's cancer, and when it seemed that the cancer had been defeated, the disease has come back.
A nine - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding finally ended up on bed in a hospital, where she still had to marry her life love.
Unfortunately, the disease has fallen.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social network account for the nearest ones.
Gemma Sisson from English Leeds loved bodybuilding.
With a friend Ricky Moore who lived with more than 16 years of age, they traveled around the world after competitions.
Nineteen - year - old woman was sports and lived healthy, yet her cancer was diagnosed in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to get better.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time the spine was attacked.
Culturalist and personal trainer, according to the information of the British daily Daily Mirror, committed a 10-hour spine surgery and then re-started with drastic therapy.
Of course, everything was futile.
At the beginning of this year, on her ninth birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde decided to enter a hospital in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged her wedding with Ricky's love.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky, last time he took Gemma to their two-month anniversary at the restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Only a few hours after her death on her social network account, there was a contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I finally died weeks after the war.
Although I'm gonna have a broken heart that I'm leaving my loved ones here, I'm gonna be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible period," she wrote on the social network, saying that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social networks," she wrote that everyone should appreciate their lives and live it full.

For a hundred crowns he will get the surrounding pocket work mostly beginning Czech artists.
Pictures and other works are created directly for the artist, so they know that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 on the 5.5th centimetre.

Health payments will rise by up to a maximum of five percent next year.
The greater increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Payments in health care could grow by up to five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Morava's questions on Czech TV.
The requirement of experts to increase up to 15 percent considers it unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficiency in providing protection aids.
The hospital, according to him, now has their supplies.
"I think the rise (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the Minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation where it has hit the choice of the insurance pandemic of coronavir and the government's anti-proliferation regulation since March.
The income of the insurance company dropped at that time.
"On 15 percent I find an increase in the moment unreal," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of the physician in acute bed care according to the data of the Department of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of the sister in the state hospitals and the wages of the other founders will be seven thousand crowns.
It also follows from the data of the ISIS that the loss of the nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was in 2019 according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office 34 125 crowns.
trade union representatives have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the supply of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by payment tables and contractual wages in towns, regions or private hospitals.
They also require uniformity for healthcare professionals.
There will be up to seven thousand crowns in the nurses this year.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to President Roman Šmucler's Czech dental chamber, experts should feel the state of this.
The House recently approved an increase in the government budget deficit on a record of CZK 500 billion, of which 1.75 billion are to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Operators, according to Smuclera, does not agree to raise wages in the next year.
According to him, the hospital and medical facilities themselves should decide the remuneration and the money should go to them through the payment notice.
Vojtěch also stated that the hospitals currently have quite a protection aid.
President Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any protection aid in its possession.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
He believes that he should try to be self-sufficiency and also buy from Czech companies.
Drowning smart quarantine could take over soldiers.
We're ready.
"Crying quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly, and it is a question whether they should be driving the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook series Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations are insufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in Moravskoslezský kraj, where they are one of the current outbreaks of epidemics.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek said that information on Sunday's conduct is not and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army, according to him, is ready for this step.
The project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a clever quarantine led a ninety-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government led by former minister Roman Prymula.
On Sunday, the dredging project criticized the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also reported that an army might reintroduce him.
The lack of authority for IT and digitisation was previously granted to the project, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is responsible for it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years of this has been self-inflicted and non-systemically, we are now trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not going with the jet.
People behind the march, poor hygiene behind the march adapt the new systems and actually catch up on the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "bloak in politics"
The current security mayor Tomáš Mamura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason for this is to "do not blow up in politics," said Respekt.cz.
At the same time, Macura, who is a member of the Bureau of the AO movement, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the lead candidate for the ANO movement in Ostrava received almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in his function for only four years.
"I thought I'd hold on to one term of office and with this business experience, I can turn everything over and build on my feet," Respekt said.
He added that for the second term of office he was allowed to speak to a certain extent.
"But it's the best thing for me.
I don't want to be stupid in this politics," Macura added, who referred to himself as a hard introvert that doesn't match frequent contacts with people.
According to the Respekt, the longer term has been speculating about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the ANO movement several times, such as the alliance with the SPD movement or the support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few figures of ANO supported Zeman's anticandidate against Jiří Drahoš in elections.
From the ANO movement to which he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel like I can change something in the movement, it's not a totally futile fight, and that no one's doing this to me, I have no immediate motive to end," Respekt said.
Six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the Ostrava Mayor in 2014, Macura, among other things, served as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He sat in other companies' organs.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
The company Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, offering transport services.
It is the consequence of the amendment of the law, stated on Thursday in the press release by the Council of Brno for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Against Uber, in Brno, the taximakers protested, pointing out that Uber did not fulfil conditions such as a name as taxi or taxiameter.
However, since July, the conditions for running ordinary taxis and alternative ones have changed.
Kratochvíl held several meetings with Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is a consequence of the amendment of the law, which allows the company to legally operate its activities.
The city was introduced with this change and we believe that society will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
They tested taxis against him because of the unmarked vehicles as a taxi or a missing taxameter.
The court has issued preliminary measures prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported the taxi driver, last year but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company didn't use it.
Now, she'll be back on the basis of the changes to the law.
Since July, it has been said that, alongside classic taxis with a lamp and a taxameter, transport services ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications can be easily operated.
Too much bujara celebration in Brno: flying chair fell by foot on the pavement of a man
From the fourth floor of the apartment, she flew out of the office chair on Saturday night in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the officers.
The watchman immediately upon arrival at the above address in the western part of the city noticed an open window under which she still lay chairs and several backpacks and pads next to her.
"The noise that came from the fourth floor room suggests that there was quite a loud celebration going on inside.
The officers went out to the apartment in the corridor and asked three young men present from the age of 60 to nine for an explanation," said the spokesman Jakub Ghan.
The Rafaje appeal request will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
The Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss on Monday with the coalition social Democrats a request for the appeal of the Chief of Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS) by Petr Rafaje.
Rafaje's appeal was called upon by non-profit organizations to act as anti-corruption councils of the government and also the Ústí Region.
Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of the Office is on the scene.
According to information from ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
The second term will end in the middle of next year, under the law cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is under the authority of President Milosz Zeman.
In addition to the challenges of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason for this is to be, among other things, Rafai's bails recently.
In the last week, the Prime Minister refused to express his request to the fact that they are familiar with the materials and that government parties are taking a "no position".
He also stated that he had not yet negotiated with the president, that he had not yet been negotiated.
According to the UOHS’s statement for appeal, there is no reason that Rafai was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and News.cz have written in the past week that police have been interested in Rafai's meeting with the captain Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision to compete for a project of controversial new zlinské hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly advocates.
He admits the pussy meeting, according to him, they dealt together with his "ser national activity".
And Raphai speaks like that.
The representative of the Ústí Region for the appeal of Rafaje called on the Government at the end of June.
It also requests reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of ÚOHS on public procurement according to the Deputy Head for Transport Jaroslav Konoža is not transparent and has signs of arbitrary.
In March last year, police interfered with the antimonopolity office for a tendrum to choose a myth.
This June, then, the server News.cz pointed out that Rafai is using apartments written on a company of powerful scenes players of ČSSD Alexander Chuba.
The advance of 3.5 million on the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafael's account.
Rafaj has been President of the Competition Office since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office of the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Raphai’s second six-year mandate expires.
The Antimonopolity Act states that the President may refer the Bureau to the proposal of the Government.
It may only be revoked if it does not perform a function for more than six months, or distorts in a serious manner its functions or independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the blanen library, the villagers collided with the heat.
Air conditioning helps
The new technology will cost 740 thousand, and it will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to a library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.

That's why I liked the air conditioning," said one of the blanenian readers Petr Novotný.
According to Luke Propy’s library, temperatures were often more than thirty degrees [30 degrees] in the building.
The southern wall of the object is glassy and in sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"The sun is in it, thanks to the curve of the building, a great part of the day.
At the same time, there is a great problem of individual separation to blow, because the window must be closed for security reasons.
This is often the case in the library at 30 degrees," Propa said.
The well was most of all on the third floor, and the reading room was on the third floor.
And the floor above the exhibition room and the principal.
The climate was also not pleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians collided at work and ended up in in in incompetence.
The problem was also regularly held in a cultural room in lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing left," Propa noted.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all library premises this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits of five.
"For limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most troublesome spaces.
The study and the reading room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," Jiří Svoboda informed from the Brno Investment Department.
He added that during the first stage workers had already installed the air engineer last fall into the spaces and modified the installation.

Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is a major change in the strategy.
He doesn't want to bury one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest environmental pollution is no new one.
In the incinerators and in the dumps, billions of clothes end annually.
The view of the slow fashion, often the neglected approach to clothing, has changed quite quickly over recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods sold for full price.
The second half that sold through the slides doesn't simply buy.
The company does not want to preserve one collection after another and at the end of each season products to discount under their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner of Michal Mikka, they are gone of times of new and old collections and blind follow-up of fast changing fashion trends.
"Most traders with discounts already count for the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the price.
It's actually kind of cheating," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on the large part of our collection being composed of so-called bass pieces - i.e. clothing, which is timeless and excessive.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is the absence of any discount typical, the price simply corresponds to its quality and the discount does not need," Mička adds.

"The condition was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The project liked the city leadership," Vacek said, who finished his work after fourteen days of intense creation.
At the same time, he needed about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
In the war, he was taken for his Jewish origin by the Nazis to the boarding camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig entered the UK, where he willingly entered the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later he conducted a pilot training in the African South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution several times visited the Czech Republic and the native Teplice, which gave him honorary citizenship.
Six-four-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has known people in the street art business under Camo's nickname, has been working with sprays in warm streets for over 20 years.
He started on the surfaces that the former Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) deployed for these purposes.
The storm Hanna arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna, on Saturday afternoon, the local time (before midnight, SELČ at night for tonight) arrived on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and in his movement over the land, he weakened on a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses great danger to residents of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong wind and intense precipitation; in addition to local floods, electricity discharges and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported according to the AP Agency.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already declared a natural disaster on Saturday for 32 periods in the southwestern Texas and recommended people to evacuate.
The strongest warnings were given to people from the coastline between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay bay, but the total of the living is to hit the territory for almost 500 kilometres before they gradually moved over North-East Mexico.
"Also Hanna is now a tropical storm, can a strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous floods and a unique torrent to represent a threat," warned the U.S. National Center for hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the storm moved in the area of the American-Mexican border and accompanied by a wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane this year in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by a wind speed of up to 145 km per hour, but it gradually fell to 112 km per hour during the procedure, which has once again eliminated Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
Local authorities called on the storms to stay at home and not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of those U.S. states that have covid-19 disease on top.
In view of the current security measures and the need to comply with the distances, there is a great challenge and potential evacuation.
Experience shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas period of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also used as shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test on the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
The local authorities have invited all evacuated to take the worms and disinfecting gels, if possible.
"We don't even have it far from behind us.
We expect a catastrophic flood," she quoted the AP Chris Brichfield, who works for the National meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions claim that in some places up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which together would flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman will lend General rank to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
It's coming from an overview of the DOD's expected events.
The reason for lending the rank of the Brigadier General is August platform July at the post of the Deputy Commander of the Alliance of Multinational Divisions of North-east Poland.
Lipka is still acting as a representative of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion of Zeman at the end of June proposed by the government.
Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Říhek as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of the North-East in the Polish Elblag, which will lead the units of the pre-scheduled presence in Poland and the Baltic.
Radikka became Director of the National Bureau for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The President's government suggested that Lipk lend the rank of the Brigadier.
According to the Law on Soldiers of the Occupation, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of his office or for the duration of his duties which requires a higher rank to be borrowed.
The post of the Deputy Commander of the Alliance is in line with the General Staff.
The soldier to whom the rank has been borrowed has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to this rank.
However, he does not have a right to make adjustments to the salary that would correspond to that rank.
Loaning favors lasts until the reason why it was granted to him.
"The Colonel Lipka proves high professional preparedness and is a model for subordinates.
In a significant way, they participate in the performance of the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and the provision of military participation in foreign operations," said the Ministry of Defence in June of the proposal for promotion.
The Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 am at the Prague Castle, the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata will attend.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help limit the spread of the new kronavir.
The German Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer announced this.
The agreed standards are compliance with both the distance or the wearing of the cloth on the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not need to be uninhabited.
She informed Reuters about this.
"I am pleased that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that ministers had to formally approve it.
The measures provided for shall include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended distance in security checks and withdrawal at the airport.
There must be enough fresh air in aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinks will also be able to accommodate the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed satisfy at least some of the requirements of airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
On Arctic Spicbers, the temperature record fell, measured almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen fell 41 years old record," said the Norwegian meteorological institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsia, and by 0.4 degrees exceeded the 1979 record, he added.
The largest city in Špicberka is about 1300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Spicbers warm faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, is set out in last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study.
The average temperature in Špicberka, according to him, has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise by even ten degrees if it does not reduce the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The rise in temperature may result in the retention of permanent frozen soils, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause more avalanche and land seines.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or tunics, which depend on the ocean's ice cubes.
The British who return from Spain have a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabin also called on citizens to avoid all travels to Estonian Spain which are not necessary because of the risk of the spread of the disease, covid-19.
The Canary Islands and the Baleár Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after they return to isolation for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," said the British diplomat in her statement.
"We have always made it clear that, if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As the British Metro noted, the latest announcements will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular vacation destinations.
The British, among other things, are concerned that they will be paid out by sick people in case they have to end up in isolation after their return from the holiday.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, ordered a 10-day holiday on Lanzarote, flying off on Tuesday.
The tour has been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to be a whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but I don't know what's going on after that announcement.
I work as a engineer, and I don't think my employer will accept that after my return from vacation, I will be in quarantine for two weeks," quoted Metro Hunter's diary.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
Over 900 newly infected, over the last two days, over the last 24 hours.
In some areas, the authorities are already strengthening the coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, are trying to reduce all nightlife and to prevent people from meeting in great times.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out an increased risk of diseases in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity purchase model will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss the electricity purchase model from the planned new block of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant on Monday.
The bill concludes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference via tariffs.
In the second case when the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be opposite.
Power power is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the customer.
The Vicepremier and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have said earlier that the more likely option is that people will save people from construction for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has shown developments several times in the past.
The idea has already criticised environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact shall be broken down between customers according to the size of the solid - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - in the case of increased electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
Havlíček said in May that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will grow and people will make money on the construction of Dukovan.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per family will be much less than people per year in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawattthodin (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for an amount, but should be included in the redemption agreement.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, on which traders are now most stocked, is currently around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) for MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of the power electricity of EUR 10, the average household may charge with the consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, normally equipped with electric appliances, including electric vacuum plates and ovens, which do not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," wrote in the documentation for the Government of the MPO.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavir pandemic showed us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices as a speculative matter," said the Czech Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group, Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law implies that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO and by the legal person owned by the State at a pre-defined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, even in repeated terms, but not more than until the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon design defines as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the power station with a capacity installed with a minimum power output of 100 megawattts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček said earlier that the new production block should have a power output of 1200 MW and a yearly production of nine terawattthodin electricity, which would correspond to the tenth expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Danish block approved by the government on Monday.
The plant should finance without delay during the construction process, with a interest rate of 2%.
The funding model also disagrees with the opposition, the possibility of Dukovany building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent in construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
The CEO of CEZ Daniel Beneš in May ČTK said that the amount expected for building the block at the current prices is approximately six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
The Treaty between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new Danish block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billions
The material that the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic was two billion crowns.
Ministeriale Klára Dostalová (for ANO) server ListReports.cz said that the material is still working on.
The document in eKlept (electronic library of the legislative process) pointed out on Friday the server Zdrawz.cz.
The Ministry has justified the fall in tourism due to coronavir.
During the Coravirus crisis, income loss and the media were recorded.
The proposal created criticism of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now intended to be viewed on the oblidacstat web site.cz, the MMR was planning to give money to the CzechTourism tourism agency on advertising in television, radio, printing, on the Internet, billboards or areas at stations.
The biggest piece of money, 700 million crowns to get television.
Most would get private television Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would get 400 million and the same piece would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be back to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used on outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or meters.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic should begin in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working, certainly not yet in the form to be presented," said Dostálová without further details of the server ListReports.
The material criticized the opposition, according to Head of TOP 09 Markéty Pekar Adam's advertising, the media benefit from the trust fund of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this deceptive contempt will be given in autumn by the election of the wound between the eyes," she wrote on the twitter.
In fact, the permanent refusal is that it's actually about helping the media hit by a crisis.
"It may also be a coincidence, I know nothing about media support," said Denik N.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We, of course, keep counting, it could be less or less.
It's a work material," she added.
The initial rescue tourism does not give a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billions for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said the chairman of the initiative Tomáš Barčík.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, it should be directed to companies, not to the media, writes an initiative in an open letter to the government.
A product of life, a rooster of beer and death as wet grass
Postmortem is also the third album called A death is the stablo of the grass of Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left on May 24.
In Frič's discography is the fifth item and, like the previous titles, there is also the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is an excellent interpreter himself.
The Frič, the 1949 year, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration paved through its own personal experience and also very niteric expression of faith.
Of course, he was far away from some aggression, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, absolutely tolerant.
In that context, Bohuslav Reynek (for example, for Jan Zahradníčková), the masters will forgive me.
Frič's album offers records of author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always very sensitively accompanied him, whether it was cellist Josef Key or Honza Bartoň and Václav Holata.
I will help - like - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petra Hruška on Frič's long poems.
"They were a proud and unending bitterness," says Hrushk, "for the state of our world, threatened by destruction.
The world, which is becoming more and more affected by the intense consumption of vanity and malice, is increasingly giving up what his soul was created from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
They called the way out of who knows that the values for which he was created have little interest, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest can't be undone.
These poems reminded us that one might have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how it would be lost.
If he sells himself to a general fall, skeptically responds, he will be horribly silenced, or he will remain at the last moment in a calm and proud duration on what he believes and what he loves."
Parubek is not my counselor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of ČSSD Jiří Parubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The President of the Party and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamáček said it on TV today Prima Party.
About Parubek's being Hamak's adviser, the ListNews.cz reported on Friday.
"Time from time to time we write texts, he sends me some material, and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion is a lot of people like that," he said.
In the subsequent discussion with Mr ODS, Ms Jana Černoch, Minister, said that many ODS members still "unobediently listen to Václav Klaus' opinions".
He thinks it's okay, because it's an experienced policy and a former president of the party, which is also a Paroubka case.
The fact that the media are doing an affair, he called it this year's cucumber season.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Parubek is the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that, on the fourth place of the candidate of the party in the mouthland, the former chairman of that cell, Petr Benda, who was associated with Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his website LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate would not comment until it was finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile starter, he's a kick in the ass, running Sweden's challenger.
Just 22-year-old American barber has ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat two years younger Duplantis, and last year he turned him into a NCAA association.
"We had a battle a year ago, when he won, and I was second, then we had a fight.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who ensured the victory by 5.95 metres.
Only since then Duplantis has fired the string up and is now in the highest tyclerical spheres alone.
In only twenty years he became a world recordman, this year on 8 February in Toruni he exceeded a 6.17 m counter, a week later in Glasgow he added a centimeter.
"He has been jumping six meters since he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the Web World Athletics.
"It was clear that once he reached out of a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would desolate.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Being Nilsen's account of successes is thinner than the one in Duplantis proud of, the American has similar goals.
So far, he suggested his possibilities at the NCAA races regularly won, this February, he improved an internal personal record on 5,93 m. Last August he won the gold medal at the pan-American games in Lima, already in 2017, with a world championship in America, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone then is for him the first time to taste Diamond's league.
"It's my priority to get on a professional track and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, surely you can do the same at events such as Olympic Games, World Championships or Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these high holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other barbers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into just a silver fight?
"He's all trying to catch him, but I don't think it's possible soon enough," he considers Nilsen.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of all the other miles."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, she'll want to raise her.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands from an disability pension that couldn't be her son.
There's a court waiting for her.
The money 33-year-old man receives from the state as an disability pension is designed primarily to improve the quality of his life.
Women up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to bad health, the judge of the sick man had removed his integrity and his mother had appointed a guardian who, among other things, had to manage his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January, a woman used some of her disability pension funds for her own needs and prepared him forty thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, saying to the accused woman that, as a guardian, she had a special obligation to defend the victims' interests.
A woman, according to the instructions of the court, even though she set up an account for her son, she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facilities and the reimbursement of the necessary drugs, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of vehicles, electric appliances and the operation of the household," she stands in the prosecution.
That he can't use his son for his own sake, a woman admitted.
However, she was fighting about the fact that she was making out with them in paying family expenses.
"We had trouble to pull the houseways out of our incomes.
We've never bought anything over-standard.
It was always on the subject of which the son would have approved buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committed to a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised she'd give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
Findings from the cave Chiquihuite in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments from limestone, between which there are fine blades, which could be used to slice meat, and pointy objects that could serve as shards or spears.
Scientists have discovered that the oldest tools come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But there are," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of the two studies published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, people of Chiquihuite caves, located at a large altitude, spent 20 000 years.
So far, the generally recognized theory has spoken of the fact that the first representatives of the kind of Homo sapiens have gone over the mainland bridge from the region of Russia today to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archeological evidence, including unique skeletons used to kill moms and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovan culture subsequently spread in large parts of North America.
This model, however, has received cracks in the past decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different sites throughout North America have been published, showing human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 11,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people might have come to the North American mainland before they thought they had.
Some of them could have gotten to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the so-called Slovenian culture was developed," said Ruth Gruhn from the university of Albert's Canadian province.
The interest in tickets has yet to be met by an optimistic scenario, claimed by the seller.
Prices are reduced gradually
Flight sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
In comparison to last summer, there is still half an interest, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
The post-crisis development thus fills out the most optimistic scenarios by the sellers.
Flight prices are reduced gradually.
The most sought destinations are, according to the sellers, especially the South European States.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are driving.
At Letuška.cz portal, they are sold most to Croatian Split.
In other countries, then, the most sought United Kingdom is, but it was one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
On Letuška.cz, about half a month, it was around CZK 6250, a year less than CZK 3000.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, even prices have decreased to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks, by about five.
The crisis has affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with much less preoccupation than before, because they are concerned about further developments in the coronavir situation.
According to earlier information, Kiwi.com’s time of purchase of tickets had decreased by about 10 days a year before departure.
"This confirms the future trend in which people will order flights with much smaller advance will require greater flexibility, less risk," said the vice president for Kiwi.com by Michal Šindelář.
Current is the average booking time prior to departure 21 days.
Together with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is rising.
There are more than 60 regular links to more than 60 destinations at the Prague airport.
Last year's summer season is about half the destination.
Big finals tonight!
Follow the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious PDC tournament has entered the finals.
In it there will be an experienced 9-year-old Scottish arrowman Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a 16-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson voted out of Justin Pip on the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table ladder.
He and James Wade, however, were fine, and in the quarter final, he was struggling with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home a world-wide one.
"Scotting Scots" had a lead in the semifinal when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the tomb from the shovel, dominated in the extension and then fought for the result of 18:16 in the final of the tournament, which he held in 2018 when he defeated Mensura Suljovič 21:19 in a wonderful battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and it is possible that it has nothing to lose, has helped him to play on a fantastic wave.
The six-year-old arrowsman first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall’s six-year-old arrows, also overwhelmed Joa Cullen in a dramatic battle, and in the quarter final, he also made Adrian Lewis strong.
The big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but in peace playing the Belgian then a fine series got a head start, which then more or less held it to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoreing, against which he exposed the occasional uncertainty of the doubles.
The case of coronavir has been at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus in the Czech Republic was first discovered, 15 212 people have proved to be infected with it.
Almost 9 600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, this is the case with 5,254 people.
It results from data from the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases over four hundred times this week.
Maxim was Friday 281 cases.
On Thursday was a positive 235 tested, on the day before 246, and on Tuesday 206.
There were 169 infected on the first working day of this week.
9 590 people, 63 percent of all the infected ones, have been cured in the Czech Republic since.
Most had a mild history of illness.
In the hospital, according to the recent data of the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavirus have assessed 19 of them as serious physicians.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
Most infected in the last seven days, in conversion to 100,000 inhabitants, Karvinsko is still showing almost 59.
It follows the period of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected to 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
New measures against the spread of coronavirus have been taken in the Czech Republic since Saturday due to an increased number of infected infections.
People have to wear peacocks at internal mass events over 100 people, it's cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside the buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced from thousands of people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have proven themselves to be a new coronavir has crossed the border of 16 million.
It was revealed by the U.S. University of Johns Hopkins, which follows the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, 645 thousand will be near to the victims who have died with covid-19 disease.
The latest million infected came to the statistics for only three days; the border of 15 million fell on July 22nd.
The largest increase in cases has in recent days had the United States which have already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where almost 1.4 million people have been infected according to the authorities.
It now comes at a record rate.
World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday more than 284,000 new cases have arrived worldwide, which is the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the People’s States, such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to the Reuters Agency, the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This includes, for example, Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
It has appeared in almost all countries in the world, and today the first case has officially announced KLDR as well.
Air in households is five times worse than outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor air quality in outdoor areas but also at home.
It was noted by the Israeli experts on the health of Carol Abraham, who quoted the journal The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who has deserved to set up the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, we need to focus on household harmfulities right now that many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA), which states that domestic air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that, due to poor air quality in their homes, 3,8 million people die a year early.
"For the epidemic of coronavirus, which has made many and still forced to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of the air in households," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one cares about the quality of home air.
However, dangerous things can be things with which a person normally comes into contact - coatings, air fresheners, desinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The toxic gas also produces clothes that we regularly wear in the dry cleaners," said Abraham.
She believes that children, old household members, and people with breathing difficulties are most at risk.
In other health, individuals may start to suffer problems such as headache, fainting, irritability of the nasal tract, nosebleed bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
In long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all the harmfuls, but come from objects inside the household, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
