The members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to be called Muppets
Among some of the members of the National Assembly, the Constituency has taken place. This is the result of a proposal to change their title to the members of the Welsh Parliament (Mmber of the Welsh Parliament, in the short of MWP).
The idea was based on the plans to transform the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of the kpin.
One of the parliamentarians of the Labour Party expressed concern about his group, saying that the new name is associated with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means a fool, and the word "pwp" – leaving.
One of Plaid Cymru’s politicians stated that its grouping was “inadvertent” from the proposal and provided other solutions.
The member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change his name. However, he pointed out that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter ‘in’ is similar to the letter ‘u’ in the Yorkshire Devil.
As part of the committee meeting, which is currently working on a draft law amending the name, she took the following position: “The most recent decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be their own.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal. Moving the meeting to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the Assembly's members for the "Talior of the Parliament", i.e. the WMP in English, although the word "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
The members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions, difficult to achieve consensus are a trouble for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, which should present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principle of appeal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum over change of country name
In the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the North Macedonia Republic.
The universal vote is intended to help to reach a dispute with the neighbouring Greek people in which the region called Macedonia is located.
The Government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the state in the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, plebicators, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Marcin's New York church are silent in connection with the problems of the troubling church in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on each corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Actually, people are being socialized in a different way" – he noted.
"Baras are no longer the regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the assets from the sale of the property will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers think they are, and that they will "be more likely to be at the point of departure".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other surrounding temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of those who buy apartments in such buildings will be of a white race. It will accelerate the complete closure of churches because it is unlikely that new inhabitants are members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers, even before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (the Church of St. Marcin joined the community decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
The surrounding assembly of African-Americans then took over the ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by a meeting led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the sellers from 125th Street (main trade street in Harlem), opposed to the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire damaged the building, however, but the parishion of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell team.
Reverend David Johnson, John Howard Johnson's son, and his successor at St Marcin's church, proudly called a new carylion called "the call of the poor."
The expert, who made the bells in July, described them in a different way, as: "cultural treasure" and "an unreplaced historic instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carylion in the world served by black music. This artist was Diioniso A. Lind, who was 18 years ago moved to the Riverside Church church, where he had a larger band waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's church didn't replace him.
In recent months, in the church of St Marcin there was a series of complex events involving architects and performers, some of them led by holy leaders of the church and some of them — the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the management body of the parish made up of lay leaders) brought its concerns to the Diocese, claiming that “it wanted to pass on the cost of counsel” although the council did not take part in employing architects and contractors sent to the scene.
Part of the parish also complains about the lack of transparency on the diet side.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California.
The authorities reported that last Saturday, the shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California, and it occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. Eninitas.
Chad Hammel reported a KSWB-TV station in San Diego that in the morning of Saturday, he dived with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help.
As Hammel said, at the beginning, he felt that the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was crying: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
After reaching Chad Hammel's scene, he noticed that the boy had a completely shattered skin around the collar.
"I began yelling at everyone to run away from the water: "The water is shark!» — Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that the fish was seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
For reasons of safety, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live here, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's shop is planning to extend its activities to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's net throws a glove to stores like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic department in their supermarkets that are in the way of home shopping, and specially trained sellers.
In the context of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth €2.8 billion and continues to develop despite the decline in the fashion and household goods – 11 online stores will be more regular with cosmetic products. If successful initiatives are to be extended to further points next year.
Return to the cosmetic industry results from searching for ways to manage space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3 000 articles. The range for the first time includes goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold articles of brand L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to these known ones, such as Boots.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its range of products for the Boutique makeup. From now on, most articles will be friendly to vegan, which is more and more demanding for younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first was opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second formation in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The universality of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, the President of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points would become more and more like a department store because the network is trying to fight discountes such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed points of the Argos network in hundreds of shops and introduced a number of Habitat points since the takeover of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sale of food products and the profitability of investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise cosmetic products and pharmaceutical products has ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was concluded following a conflict of division of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's launches a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £ 125 million three years ago.
According to Lloyds reports, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four web shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commercial Affairs Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers during shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to draw attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way they buy."
Peter Jones "extended" after the Holly Willoughby withdrawal from a contract worth £11 million
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Day TV program, was "inclusive" when he found out Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the worth of £11 million to focus on the reconnected cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
Activities have often been compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a well-sustaining Lifestyle brand and to focus on the reconnected cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, was enraged by Peter Jones, Dragons' Day.
As the sources say, Peter Jones was "bad" when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million, there will be no time to devote their margin offering the accessories and articles of Truly's household.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand. It was also intended to double Holly Willoughby’s assets estimated at £11 million.
Following a decision to leave Truly for a 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram Peter Jones left the Great Britain, pretending to be one of his summer homes.
As the source reports, “Marka True was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She's been connecting her future to her, and she's wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the activity was entirely surprised by all the persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts consider that giving up the presenter of this Morning and one of the biggest stars in the UK could cost millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows to clothing and household articles – as well as further delaying entry into the market.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been keeping close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones included 40% of the TV company's shares in Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
The source close to Peter Jones last night said: "We will not comment on his business issues."
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president was joking with the media criticism caused by the attention that some considered to be a “unfamiliar man of state” as well as a positive relationship with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a funny voice by pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Dzong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trumpa by a major step towards the deuclarisation of North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
After more than three months from the July summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that he did not see a "analytic response" from the United States for early North Korea to disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are dealing with North Korea,” he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions would be dead.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim Djong Un have brought positive results: they have resulted in the completion of rocket trials, helped to free hostages and return to other American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Dzong Un.
“It’s easy to behave in the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” said Trump, showing the fingers of the crowd gathered right in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told not to need their help.
Despite the loss of the roof over more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up the efforts of international aid.
“In many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not want international support, so the situation is difficult” said Selina Sombung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international personnel will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to verify whether aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although in Aceh Province, shelters have been built in case of tsunami, they are rare in the case of the rest of the shoreline.
The lack of siren warning against the tsunami in Pal – despite the warning – probably had an impact on the number of deaths.
Even in the most favourable travel conditions between Indonesian islands, it is challenging.
The natural clouds make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok aims with the help of the earthquake victims to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach.
President Joko Widodo has improved the Indonesian infrastructure with the main point of his campaign and has allocated plenty of money to the road and rail lines.
However, in view of the next year's election, the President's administration is facing a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the continued religious tension in the country. Members of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost the roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian gangs and Muslims using machetes, arches, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool's football player Daniel Sturridge wins the draw in a game with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool before losing Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning the 89th minute of the Saturday match at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri at approximately 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 for the failure of his team.
He put the ball on his left leg before taking the shot towards the remote goal.
The ball has glided high above the penalty field towards the right corner of the grid.

"I noticed Kanta coming, I took the ball and gave it a shot without deeper thinking."
Chelsea ran 1-0 in the middle of a match after the Belgian star goal of Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The enemy of Heaven kicked the ball with the heel to Mateo Kovati and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted administration in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful play forward in the criminal field back to Hazard.

Cromwell's monument to the British Parliament was the last victim in a dispute about "the writing of a new story"
The removal of the monument would bring justice as a reminder of the Taliban’s activities to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and "I'll try writing the story again".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute about Oliver Cromwell’s character before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of English domestic wars, paintings were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestor Thomas was previously determined not to punish Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell in the memorial is to see the way this opinion was enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people it is a character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in his interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people Cromwell was perceived, perhaps more frequently in the 19th century than in the present time, behind the defense of Parliament’s external pressures. In this case, of course, it was a monarchy.
The assessment, as appropriate, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is of course that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has further shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known character identifying one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be attended and remembered."
In China, there was a deadly crushing of a farmer by a pig.
As local media reports, a fatal attack on a farmer occurred at a marketplace in the south-west of China.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloody and with a cut artery near a spotlight at the marketplace in Liupanshui, Kuejtya Province.
Pigs are prepared for vaccination in the pigs, 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning a cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby pig.
He said there was a lot of blood on the rift in the weed.
The cadaver section confirmed that it was close to a 250-kilogram pig who was killed by a farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and directed” said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
You can see on the surveillance camera that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview for Guiyang Evening News, that during the time of the gathering of evidence by the police the request was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the men's family and market authorities negotiate compensation for death.
Cases of pigs have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, nearly 300-kilogram pig nailed the farmer to the tractor, and the man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon through pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitobie told the CCC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can release brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're like an inquisitive child... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We simply need to show them the proper respect" - he said.
The remains of Rosa’s hurricane will cause intense rainfall in the south-west of the United States
In line with the forecasts of hurricane Rosa, it loses its strength by moving on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the south-west part of the United States.
The hurricane Rosa towers at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. the eastern time was given to him Category 1. It was then 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
As expected on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, on the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form than it is heading east towards the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California peninsula in the form of tropical storms, moving the mass of wet air north to the western United States.
On Monday, it will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in part of Mexico.
In the following days, wet tropical air entering contact with the coming rain in the south of the United States.
In some places, precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution movements and possible drains in desert areas.
Moisturised tropical air will lead to precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is especially true for some of the areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is foreseen in some areas of the South West, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot on desert ground.
The rich sinks can change the canyons in the river river, and storms with lightnings will cause local savvy winds and dust movement.
Coming before it will bring heavy local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm can be found, which can cause minor movement of pollutants and road dangers.
It would be the first rainfall in the region so far.
The tropical rains will begin to come near Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday. Monday afternoon and on Tuesday, precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday the vast rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and continue to be Wednesday.
In October, with cooling in the Arctic region around the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature at small distances.
A good example is that there are Sunday temperatures in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City (St. Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and between St. Louis (St. Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days summer temperatures may rise again.
In a large part of the Central and Eastern United States, the temperature should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the south of the Greater Yins to the north east.
On Tuesday in New York, temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of over-the-counter temperatures in the United States' east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people saw six television stations moving on Thursday's candidate for the Supreme Court Judge Bretta Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, women in charge of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly programmed to inform about the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the prosecution.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate jury that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was soaking her in the state of frailness and trying to take her clothes off at a high school event.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that the fifth number of TVs was even bigger than the number of Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of TV stations of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, no figures were available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
In addition, Nielsen tends to be difficult to measure visibility among people at work.
The given number is similar to watching football games of the American football pool or giving prizes to the American Film Academy.
According to reports, Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings.
The second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The subject concerned remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key character of Friday's events.
In the morning hours he was captured by the CNN and CBS station camera after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the video, he screams at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator by way of hearing the jury.
Flake with his head dropped off for a few minutes listened to an inadvertent opinion. The whole event was broadcast by the CNN station.
“I am standing here before you and asking.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have so many women's power in the face of power."
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued a valid statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to transmit events pending the vote on the assignment of Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate.
Flake said he'd only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which insisted on the minority of Democrats.
Flake and his friend, Senator Chris Coons, convinced him of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after he met Chris Coons and some other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have had the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI's investigation of charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own benefits

He grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 collections per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU Will Wade said that the team was "healthy" and "scuffed" Wayde's death.
“This is one of those things we are constantly afraid of,” Will Wade said.
Ashes emitted by volcano reach the city of Mexico
Ashes rising from the volcano Popocatépetl reached the southern districts of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre left Mexico’s inhabitants closer to the volcano in connection with an increase in activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has been reported in numerous dubbings and shocks.
The photos published in the social media show the front windscreens of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the districts of Mexico, such as Xochimimilco.
Since the earthquake, with a force of 7.1 degree, which was visited by Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase in volcano activity of 72 km to the south east of the capital of the country.

Ancient police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the ageing of demonstrators in support of Catalonia's independence with police prevention departments.

As the local press reports, 14 people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries suffered during protests.
After one year from the 1 October referendum, the tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for those who want the Catholic secession.
The majority voted for independence. However, attendance was low due to the extensive boycott of the enemy.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year in violent brawls with police trying to stop voting at constituency sites.
On Friday night, a group of people supporting the region’s independence decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration was held despite this, but it was forced to change the route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician taking part in the Separatist protest, said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's independence.
“ Last year, we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were glad to vote, but now we are stuck in a point without an exit," he said.
Despite a significant, small victory in local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalonia secession have difficulty continuing. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting a trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and later the announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old engineer recording protests supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are intimidating conflict.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, the Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced its willingness to start in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"The European Parliament elections are the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic value of the Spanish Government" he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after having taken a car in a house
Three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple hit by a house in Londonderry.
There was an event at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 British Time (BST).

At some point in the direction of the car he could also be fired from the crossbow.
Mengi Gate provides Livingston win over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingston brought the team victory.
This season, playing in the extraclass club Livingston, led Rangers to be deceived, giving Steven Gerrard only a second failure in his 18 matches at the club coach's position at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's gate turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's band moved to second place in a table occupied with Hibernian.
The team under the leadership of Gerrard remains in this season without winning the trip to Premiership. In the next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Before that, because on Thursday, Rangers will be hosting a Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League of Europe.
Livingston extends a series of victories in his division to six games. Coach Holt has failed since being replaced last month by Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed a few occasions against the undisposed opponents.
Holt's team should have been running a lot earlier, as the band's game caused a lot of problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and fired the goallight, but he couldn't shoot the goal, and then Alan Lithgow didn't get to take over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer goals, knowing they could threaten the rivals during the permanent parts of the game.
And that's how the determining goal fell.
Following the Rangers’ throw, Livingston's free team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created Menga situation, which won a goal from the center of the penalty field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't reform the defence of the hosts and they didn't cause more problems to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos took one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was chosen by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow couldn't get into the light of the gate from the next permanent piece judged for Livingston.
Rangers continued their attacks in Livingston's criminal field, but they couldn't take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty shots after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton's variable and one hand-to-hand.
“Fenomenal” performance of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and results for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost haven't changed since returning to extraclasses. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This sword had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halket played a huge role in leading a great organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell very careful throughout the game.
Rangers didn't want to fight anymore.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, they have not maintained their standards in the game.
In their game there seemed to be something missing: only once, it was possible to break through the defense of the hosts, it should be a serious warning for the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit in Cologne
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September) to the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied the smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, which was intended to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
The disputes led to differences in human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Colony, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks besides its homeland.
According to the police, 25th crowds gathered outside the temple for security reasons were blocked, but the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt a policy in the country.
On the contrary, protests reflect the division that has raised the policy of a hero who lives in Germany and considered to be an autocrat by others.

Long Lartin Penalty: Six officers suffered injuries due to riots
As the authorities report, six officers suffered injuries due to riots in the men's detention facility with an increased level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin detention facility in Worcestershire began on Sunday about 9:30 British time (BST) and continues.
Eight prisoners in one of the wings of the establishment were called for a specialised “Tornado” unit.
Officers on the spot had a minor facial injury.
The Ombudsman said: “In HMP Long Lartin, specially trained personnel were involved.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our institutions. We are convinced that those responsible will be sent to the police and they can spend more time in prison."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.

The sudden floods caused by the hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the possible beneficial impact on the areas covered by the drought)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona's state, which is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week. The remains of Rosa's hurricanes move across desert areas of the South West, creating a threat to sudden floods.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the potential of emergency floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and Eastern Nevada, South East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
As expected on Tuesday, Rosa will cross directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, rainfall will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed on Twitter that “from 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the condition of storms or tropical depressions within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the state border of Arizona."
The latest models of National Hurricane Center are forecasting precipitation from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the other desert areas of the South West, including in the central Rocks and Great Kotlin mountains, the amount of precipitation will probably be between 2.5 and 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
Those outside the areas at risk of sudden flooding from hurricane Rosa can bring relief, since the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the precipitation will improve the situation in the South West, where drought conditions are in place.
As reported by the Weather.com portal, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the area of Arizona is struggling with touching droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa is first on the California peninsula in Mexico.
In Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move from hurricane to 137 km/h. Currently, it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Huragan's getting colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing him to get weaker.
According to forecasts, he'll hit Mexico with a tropical storm in Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The Weather.com portal reported that “in the area from the California peninsula to the north-west part of the state of Sonar the rainfall ranges from 7 to 15 cm, although they can reach 25 cm.”
Then the hurricane Rosa will cross the north of Mexico as a tropical storm. On Tuesday, early morning, she will reach Arizona’s border as a tropical depression.
“The most serious threat caused by the hurricane Rosa or its residues is a very high rainfall on the California peninsula, in the north-west part of the state of Sonar and in the south-west desert areas of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, rain causes life-threatening sudden floods and movements of pollutants in the desert and mud avalanche in the mining area.

Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh “has come to know the anger and anger of the Democratic Party”
“The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is against the absolute and intimidating proceedings of the Democratic Party,” said Trump on the Wheeling Tower in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "has known anger and anger" during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the congress, standing and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's accusations. The woman claims a few decades ago when both were teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges she filed.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans were able to learn about the brilliantness, the class and courage of Kavanaugh.
“The voice of judge Kavanaugh is one of the most important lawyers of our time, a knowledge of the great merits of the community,” said he before a crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, which was about the importance of the Republicans' turnout in the middle of the election presidency.
“We are five weeks apart from the most important choices in our lives.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active" - he said.
"I am still fighting to defend our wonderful candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are working on a policy of "consistencing resistance and hampering activities".
As CNN said, one of the assistants to an important Republican policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
As the authorities passed on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by the high waves breaking down on the beaches – following a heavy earthquake and tsunami that visited the island of Indonesia Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered at the beach to take part in the festival’s held in the city. At the end of the shore, waves reached about 6 meters high, taking many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
“When a danger occurred yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the conference in Jakarta, the spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for natural disasters BNPD.
“Tunami attacked everything on her way, driving cars, bars and houses,” he reported Nugroho. He then added that before reaching the shoreline, he moved to sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them saved themselves from a tree climb and managed to survive.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The airfield photos published by the disaster agency show many damaged houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastline was followed by secondary shocks.
In the area of 2.4 million people there were earthquakes.
According to the statement by the Indonesian Energy Assessment and Use Agency (BPT) released by the vast five earthquakes was about two hundred times higher than the energy of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb in World War II.
The statement states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, could have affected the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He then added that the body parts of the victims were found under infected buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the victims could be larger along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
According to Nugro's communication, "has been completely paralysed," there is therefore no reports from Donggala Province.
"Big over 300,000 people" – you can read in the statement of the Red Cross. It was also added that employees and volunteers of organisations go to the site affected by the disaster.
“We can now speak of tragedy, although the situation may be deteriorating significantly,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a common criticism because of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities stated that the waves came just after the warning was issued.
On the amateur video made available in social media, you can see a man screaming out of the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of the person on the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall crashed on the shore, taking buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to confirm immediately the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused significant shortages in electricity supply, preventing communication within the Palu. This, in turn, hampered the coordination of rescue activities by authorities.
According to the military authorities, the sending of transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities has begun, however, those evacuated still need food and other essential articles of the first need.
The airport located in the city was opened only for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit centres for people evacuated in Palu.
Over 800 victims of tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay reported, the national director of the World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala Province to Palu and found refuge in the tents of a rampart in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although part of the group slowly starts to help, there are criticisms that workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financing, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the national disaster is declared.
It hasn't been done yet.
"We are officially dealing with a regional disaster", said the spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to take international aid, but this is not the case."
After two days from the fifth earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing people continue to hope that their close miracles will find themselves among destructions.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday's rescue team released a woman who spent two days in the midst of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's paralotiar representation, trained two missing paralots participating in the Indonesia and Asian Games this month.
As Petra Mandagi said, other persons trapped in Roa Roa were his students.
“As an experienced parallelist, I struggle with my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Gendon Subandono reported that in a few hours after the arrival of the community's paraplanetaires information about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was desperate to send messages through the WhatsApp Communication to athletes participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered" - he said.

Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote: “A person known earlier as Kanye West. ”
For some time he has been using the pseudonym Ye. It is also the title of his eighth album issued in June.
The change took place before visiting Saturday Night Live. It is expected that he will present his new album named Yandhi during the performance.
It will be replaced by a singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, gave up "for emotional reasons".
West has already said that the word “Ye” is not only a shortcut from his current artistic home, but a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that «ye» is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means «You»,” said West in the previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about Big Boy’s pseudonym.
“So I am you, I am us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all of our good, bad, and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West has been in the midst of other famous rappers who have decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-workers, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with a adapter, without a connector and capital letters.
President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody demonstration of students' demonstrations, President of Mexico's electricity Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use military against civilians.
On Saturday, at the Square of Three Culture López Obrador promised to “ never use the troops to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire to the square for peaceful demonstrations, killing up 300 people. At a time when the left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the young people of Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance for learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and no chance of educational pride young people towards crime groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and expert of artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies, together with the increase in China's activity in this area, the US should double its research expenditure on SI.
The comments made are linked to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
However, last year China presented its plan, according to which they want to be the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"At first, we need to double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make a further breakthrough in this area", said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubled funds could double the chances of taking another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the president of the company Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980 ’ s, Kai-Fu Lee worked for Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system, which defeated the best American player at Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Google branch.
Lee recognised the success of earlier technology initiatives in the US government, e.g. the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the struggle, because he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to try hard to get government subsidies.
“It is not China that is the best representatives of the academic community, but corporations,” said Lee.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the US in the development of the SI.
"I believe that those dealing with artificial intelligence, who have obtained the degree of scientific doctor, should automatically admit themselves to a green card", he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for academic institutions in a similar way to the US National Science Foundation and other government organisations granting resources to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
During the earlier period of this year, the Department of Defence established a combined centre for artificial intelligence (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center) to engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special committee for artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also informed about the allocation of USD 2 billion to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than 100 billion USD per year in research on SI.
At the same time, the US initiative to set up a national committee on artificial intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum over the change of their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow a few decades to dispute with Greece, which blocks the efforts of the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory, and therefore concluded that the country was joined to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the label, but nationalists claim that a change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Soviet majority living in Macedonia.
President ▶orge Ivanov said that he would not vote. The campaign encouraging boycott raised doubts as to whether the attendance would reach a minimum level of 50% required to recognise the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying the price for the possibility to join Macedonia – one of the countries that have been created following the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union and NATO.
"I voted in favour of my country's future so that young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security" said the 79-year-old Oźwierian of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians declared that it was up to the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The State electoral committee has informed that no unusual events have been reported until 13 a.m.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe" – said Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Zorica's wife and son, Zorica and Duszko voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
Before the building of Parliament in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs before tents distributed by those boycotting referendums.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with our head and head and not the back door” said Kawardkow.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries such as China and Russia and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments of Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will speak for the change of name in the referendum because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO", said Zaew after his vote.
He stated that the vote "yes" was "the confirmation of our future".
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute between 30 and 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another survey by the Macedonian TV survey, Telma TV is planning to vote for 57% of the respondents on Sunday.
70% of the questionnaires claimed that they would alter their name.
To succeed, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow in the pro-Western government policy since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City will defeat Brighton's entire defense and win the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent off Brighton's defense home at a Saturday meeting with a result of 2:0 for Manchester City. The game was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (English).
The gate captured by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with the administration in the middle of the field to the Argentinian attacker.
The Colonel has crossed three attorneys of Brighton.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First, he won one of them, and then he crossed the others, and he was on the edge of Brighton's penalty field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguire in a criminal field that defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is in danger of foot injury,” said the reporters of Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We discussed the possibilities of play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have won the goal at that time."
However, Sterling provided a blue first lead in a duel in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero got the ball deep to half Brighton.
He sent a wonderful order along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a long line.
Manchester City's attacker put the ball in the grid just before it went to the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA League group on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will be held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherer wants to ruin his chances of winning Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he did not have to take part in the first composition.
However, Scherzer hopes to be in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only Rockies keep their chances of playing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one victory more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
Rockies can at least count on the wild card if they win Friday's meeting against the Nationals result of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
“In spite of playing “o nothing”, at least we will come out of the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for a Sunday meeting, but the team is leaning towards the exhibition of Scherzer in the first composition.
This would be the thirty-four of Scherzera's first compositions. He took part in Thursday's strike training and hopes to be on Sunday.
The right-hand footballer of the Washington team records 18-7 and ERA 2,53. 300 times the bats were eliminated and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
Trump was not directly referring to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the Republicans' turnout in the middle of the elections.
“In November, we are putting all the achievements we have so far achieved.
We have five weeks apart from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our wonderful candidates" - he said.
He then continued: “We have a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to take authority by all means, and they are wicked and mean.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to get power and control, but taking control and taking control is their goal, but we won't give it back to them."
As he said, the Democrats are implementing the "consistencies and obstacles to business".
"It was very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, mean, unpleasant and unrighteous".
The president referred to the Senate Court of Justice, referring to the name and name of the American senator of the Dianne Feinstein Democratic Party, which had come to face with a loud awakening from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
«Ah, am I listening?
No, I mean... no. Her body language was terrible. It was the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to individuals expressing their own opinions
When Momentum's activists voted in my party for giving me a hate, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Labour Party group, who has recently been told that they are not welcome, and all because of expressing their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for adversity was due to the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic, national security and Europe policies, as the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday, the announcement of the parliamentary meeting of the Labour Party from the Nottingham East district could be read: “We want meetings to be open and productive.”
For eight years I have been in charge of the work of the Labour Party, most of the Friday meetings of the General Committee have just looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now going differently. It has been forgotten of the promise of a “seriouser and milder” policy, as long as they have ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, and each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the management of the batch.
Everything began soon after Jeremy Corbyn's position. Colleagues, in the case of whom I thought we had similar views, began expecting changes in direction and positions that I would not agree with before, were concerned with issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for nomination, condemnation of centralism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments I address are rather political.
I admire professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience treatment every day in a sexist or racist way but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to a common order with insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With each proposal for “the freedom of distrust” and every change in the rules for the selection of the world’s view of the party is narrowed down.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to quench and quench certain issues, and then everything "it would be okay".
But that's not why I've dealt with politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the dissolution of my school class, I try to take care of the better quality of public service for those in need – both as a local council and a minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, including during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew the differences with the party authorities.
To those who supported the fifth proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the President of the Labourgists in the face of the coming Brexite, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to its voters (both the members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threats to the withdrawal of nominations or any political targets will discourage me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interest of you all.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – the undefeated Ayr again the mountain
Two late assumptions could have a chance to have the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr's team deserved to win this extremely interesting Scottish extraligia match.
The team was first placed in the table and remains the only disturbed team.
At the end, this distinctive defense and the better use of opportunities led a team of hosts to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his care.
"We have been challenging so far, but we are still invincible, so I am pleased" – he said.
Robyn Christie from the Melrose team said: “We need to pay respect to Ayr players.
Ayr went on to run in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson was added and Frazier Climate increased. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes’s school, who came to the band from the Glass Warriors, allowed Melrose to compensate for the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance for a raise.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr after he kicked out of the penalty line just before the first half. He first got attached, and then he took advantage of the chance to increase, obtaining a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose's second half started well. Patrick Anderson's application raised by Baggot has reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a long stop on the game due to a serious injury by Ruarida Knott. After the resumption of Ayr, the player lifted up the lead after Stafford McDowall and Clima increased.
Following that, the captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose again took advantage of his number: the application of Bruce Colvin's untapped attempt to increase driving.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for beating Clima without a ball. MacPherson won the landing on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to increase. He then again managed to increase the score just after the resumption of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the penalty shot and enabled the wingman Gregor Henry to get the fifth set for the hosts.
Still Game series star starts his career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, Still Game's Star, seems to be starting out in the gastronomic industry. It is recently discovered that he was the director of the restaurant manager.
The 56-year-old actor is involved in the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular sitcomie of BBC Station. He performs and co-creates a series together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
Duet announced that the 9th season would be the last in the history of the show, and it would all point out that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The Actor refused to comment on this subject, however informer Scotty Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the “rolling gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": without access to the sea, Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Navy patrol the area of La Paz Navy base.
From public buildings hang blue flags.
At the port of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the following motto is seen: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the absence of access to the sea, Bolivia's memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
This hope is perhaps the biggest one for several decades, and it is expected to be the judgment of the International Court of Justice, to be released on 1 October following a five-year trial.
“Stoli’s activities are a distraction. The inhabitants are unanimity, optimistically set and count for a favourable verdict,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivias across the country will jointly watch the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that an organization based in Hague will recognise the claim of Bolivia and after decades of fruitless discussions Chile will have to proceed to negotiations on the granting of an independent sea country.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who will next year be in arousing the debate on re-election, will also place hope in Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the chances of favourable to Bolivia are small and that even the favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in Hague has no power to grant Bolivia to Chile. He also warned that it would not affect possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chinese international law specialist, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be made six months after the final arguments were presented.
Unfortunately Bolivia, for the last four years, they could have taken the country away from their destination.
"The question of access to the sea was taken by the current Bolivian administration" said Paz Zárate.
Morales' impenetrable rhetoric has depriving the Chilians of any goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
For both these countries, since 1962, there has been no exchange of ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the decision-making process was very fast.
Monday, Bolivia will “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “the completion of 139-year-old dispute with reference to mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the subject of access to the sea as part of the political game.
“The pain will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we must deal with the past.”
North Korean rulers claim there will be no nuclear disarmament until they can trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be at the edge of the renewal of suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after a meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "murson" is as if the lack of sanctions and opposition of the United States to the declaration ending Korean war has ever dropped North Korea on its knees.
Washington won't agree to sign the declaration without Pjongjang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a common scepticism about the fact that Pjongjang is seriously taking off the arsenal that is perceived in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the appearance of the latest line of great head cover in clothing shops.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely cover yourself before the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the run a number of crazy, overdimensional headgears in their collection of summer for 2019, which dazzled in style during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s distinctive work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered barrel of models’ head.
Other over-dimensional accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a hat of wizards, and even annass — but they were not designed to warm their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had a sewn mouth and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than a hanute Couture.
One creation was like diving equipment with tubes and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers provide that huge hats can go to clothing shops.
Non-dimensional hats follow La Bomba, a strawd hat with a width of 61 cm, which they all wore — from Rihanna to Emily Ratikkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely unrighteous hat, which was passed through social media, presented another great creation — a straw beach bag almost as big as a bathing model.
Burned orange bag with rafia, finished with rafia fringes and depleted white leather handle, distinguished in the collection of Jacques La Riviera for summer 2019 during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in stores of the following years — because the designer has managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use demand for over-dimensional accessories”.
John Edward: Language skills needed for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to boast the next excellent results of their exams, based on individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other social projects.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, attended by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, aim to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim at preparing students for further and higher education, their chosen career pathways and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a school-friendly learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for school selection.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in the language that he understands, then it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages are first placed in league rankings, with the highest rates of enforceability for independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of pupils learning foreign languages received a higher assessment of A.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received a higher rating of A in Mandarin and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A evaluation.
This shows that schools independent from Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills, whose children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, language learning as objects to choose is carried out in the same scope as the science of STEM objects (study sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of study programmes in independent schools and other places.
The 2014 study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that for reasons of difficulties in the establishment of job-free jobs by employers in 17 percent, the lack of language skills of candidates was equivalent.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language knowledge,
A lifelong skill, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the defence of the career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to YouGov's 2013 survey, in which more than 4000 British adults were involved, 75% of them were unable to speak foreign language well enough to speak, and the French language was the only language that was used by two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important to the UK in the period 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the child's interest, there will always be a number of languages in independent schools that will be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scottish schools are independent of the creation of a teaching environment that will prepare children and take them in skills necessary for their success, regardless of what is going on for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that international business languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "national communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer a large selection, diversity and level of Scottish youth.
It's just the way it is.
John Edward, President of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debiut LeBren on a Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans willing to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers were finally waiting.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that LeBron James would play in a Sunday pre-seven game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know yet how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudell, told on Twitter that James is most likely to play less than a minute.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked for his plans for six pre-seven Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-sequential games to prepare," he said.
So Trumpa vote in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of electoral towers in Wheeling in Virginia tonight.
It is the first of the five electoral truces planned by Trumpa to take place next week, along with positions in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice of free office in the Supreme Court, Trump is committed to building up support in the upcoming elections on the half-years of government, as the Republicans may be threatened by the loss of control of Congress when the votes are submitted in November.
What time is it that will take to take place tonight at the Trumpa electoral age in West Virginia and where will you be able to see it online?
So Trump's vote in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held today at 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
So Trumpa's vote in West Virginia will be able to follow live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of a candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tight atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual mistrial and the anticipated vote in the Senate on suspension for a maximum period of one week at the time of the FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral age is to support the Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trumpa's campaign with five towers next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and support supporters to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives” — Reuters.
"The Congress Constituency is such an important point in the President's schedule that as the hottest campaign season comes, he will visit as many states," said Trumpa spokesman, who did not agree to give his name to Reuters.
Today’s electoral age at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from “Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help a Western Virginia candidate into the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisy, who is losing in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisy when the President comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the struggle, maintaining hope of victory in the Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions the Foursome format of Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The catchy shuttle of dissipation is a completely invented concept of sport, but one that players really believe in, and yet most of all in competitions like these.
So what's their distraction at this point?
"They've been running six points, and now they're running only four, so I think we have a little distraction," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, Europe has four points, while 12 are still available.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in sails and have worthy patterns to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them could boast by getting three points out of four.
Spipath is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on the whole throat, which was a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, covering the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas got two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them victory with the result of 15, met with a similar scream — the one that allowed them to understand that the American team is still in the game.
"It's enough to focus and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
It's all that's left of all these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spiest and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of European teams won four of four and were not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple on Saturday afternoon that didn't include Bogey, but also avoided the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way to play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the ghastly crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they played different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played a quick Sergio Gartě, morning's football hero when he was paired with Aleks Noren.
Bogey and the double doble on the front of Ninne kicked off Spanish and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
Sunday, there's no one who can help get out of the hole.
The Fourball and Foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the couples, the councils they give, the advice they do not give, and how a change of strategy can occur at one point.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the Foursome session has also shown that the US team has a fight in which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the result of 10-6 Saturday football and Foursome games with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — led the grayman to two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing his previous score on Le Golf National to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, tried to preserve the trophy that lost a series of 3-1 results in Hazeltine two years ago.
The United States has become greater resistance in the Foursome format, winning two matches, but they could not make a loss.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyka's team must win eight points from 12 singles, which will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debut that won four points in a row, while along with Molinarim (the team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a big way, they beat Woods and the American debut Bryson Dechambeau, getting an even more empathic score of 5-7.4.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday games, showed occasional flashbacks of a genius, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in Fourball and Foursome formats, and that's seven out of a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the Foursome format to overcome the result of 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which are active in global rankings of items 1 and 3 respectively.
However, the European team did not all come after this pleasant, cool day in a field set up in the south west of Paris.
The three-time lead winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up an American reference point, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a result of 2&1 over Spain, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4-7 in the Foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting the singles, although the Furika team would only be a draw to preserve the trophy.
However, in the second place two days ago, Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says "constantly not" to unilaterally disarm without trust.
The North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister said on Saturday during the UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that this country will unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the General Assembly last year that North Korea took the "significant goodwill", such as halting nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to non-proliferation weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any specific answer from the US, however," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of national security and under such circumstances there is no one-sided disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints regarding Washington's reluctance to the "stop" approach to denuclarisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject the unilateral deuclarisation as it had occurred in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the President of the United States and the head of North Korea, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Unn committed himself to work on the "denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war ( leta 1950–1953), but the U.S. representative announced that Pjongjang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also supported calls to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insist on "deuclarisation in the first place" and increase pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its objective in a forced way, against even the signing of the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
“The statement that sanctions can put us on our knees is the colds of people who behave against us in an ignorant way.
However, the problem is that the lack of sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri never mentioned plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was mentioned at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and added: "If the party on denuclarisation was South Korea and not the United States, then there was no impasse in the Denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula".
Mim, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year, when he said that during the United Nations General Assembly, that the targeting of North Korea rockets in the United States is inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump (Mr. Bad President Trump) named Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (a rocket man) on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump forum, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim Jong Una for his courage to take steps for disarmament, but also said that a lot of work needed to be put in place, and he also concluded that until North Korea is deprived of nuclear weapons, the sanctions would not be abolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a time interval for it, saying: “It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue and be continued until we find the full, final and verified deuclarisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, trying to choke on the funding of the nuclear programme and ballistic missiles of Pjongyang.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said that he would return to Pjongjang in preparation for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, and then in a few hours North Korea condemned him for "the establishment of gangster demands".
North Korea has committed itself this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it will disassemble a place of testing rockets and a nuclear complex if the United States takes the appropriate measures.
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the " appropriate measures" he cared about are the security guarantees that Trump committed to in Singapore and to take steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on an adequate long rest.
The new Harvard University, held this year, provided more sleep to all students, which was intended to combat a growing macho culture by learning from "the year-long cofeine-driven students".
Students from the world’s best university often have no idea about the basics of self - care.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such in the United States.
He was inspired by the opening of a speech on the effects of sleep abuse on science.
“ After the talk, one girl came to me and said: “Why do I have to say this now that I’m in the last year of college?
She said no one's ever told her about the meaning of a dream that surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, it explains to students how good dreams-related habits help to achieve good results in science and sport and improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that this course was decided to introduce after it was found that students had suffered a serious lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes the image of a room in the dormitory where students click the cup for coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light, and how sleep shortages affect sports results and how important it is to keep your sleep regularly.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not result in immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in the “night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly growing pressure on students means an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
To provide sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" student fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go through hunger mode, which makes the student constantly hungry, said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his activities last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to put a course for the whole campus.
The next step is to invite all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when you need to go to sleep and when you need to get up, and that they are aware of the harmful effect of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, which can crush the rhythm of the daytime and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga is taking over Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered again during the struggle to leave Livingston, when Dolly Menga fired his arrow led to a failure of Steven Gerard's disassembled band, obtaining a 1-0 score.
The team at Ibrox Stadium wanted to record her first victory since the 4-1 triumph in February, but Gary Holt’s team defeated Gerrard in 18 games, causing eight points to the team in relation to Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the composition of Rangers showing lack of commitment did not seem to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a 6th drop, Livingston became third — just behind Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to provide the head of Judge Caluma Spence after he was hit by an object thrown out of guest court.
Gerrard introduced eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to ahead and move to the semi-final of Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, passed through the same eleventh Livingston team, who took the Hearts point last week, being thrilled by the way in which his well-trained band tormented at every step of its opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston's team has done more with the ball since they got it.
They should have gotten a goal in just two minutes, when Menga's first launch of the ball allowed Scott Pittman to face with Allan McGregor's goal, but he didn't use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep-free launch to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played in the position of the defender, could only stay in the rear position.
Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he belonged to being a criminal for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson solved the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed only two customs shots in the first half, but they were the goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely concerned with Lassany Coulibaly's head and weak shot of Ovie'go Ejaria.
While the 34-minute goal of opening could be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with the deep constant part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, giving it to Mengi for a simple finish.
Gerrard didn't waste his time and replaced Coulibaly on Ryan Kent — this turn almost immediately made an impact on the wingman who put the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, running from its position.
Livingston team continued to attract guests into the game exactly what they liked when Lithgow and Halkett made a long delivery one by one.
The Holt team could have increased the drive in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good stand in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow gave up the corner game.
The Rangers reserve, Glenn Middleton, was hoping for a penalty shot once again when he became involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes back.
Almanac: Geiger's numerator
And now the page from our edition of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's numerator has become both an element of science and pop culture, for example, in the film "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, in which you had the seemingly unlikely cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?
Rogers: “This is the geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now you hear something!"
Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name has survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise hostile cells during treatment.
This method consists of the separation of immune cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory.
At that time, they may "see" a protein common to many cancers, and then they are injected again into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, an immune system was observed to recognise hostile cells for more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-injection to the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Raka Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very well-saturated.”
HER2 “supplies the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and large intestine, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach by collecting immune cells from patients and ‘avoidation’ their location of cancer cells has been used to treat some type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is leaving for a pro-truspve diatribe in Saturday Night Live — with a MAG cap on his head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "bushed" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the President of the United States of Donald Trumpa and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After carrying out his third track titled Ghost Town that night, during which he had founded a cap entitled "Made America Great", he conducted an expedition against Democrats and again expressed his support for Trumpa.
"I am talking to white people, I hear: "How can you like Trumpa? He is a racist!"
If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago", he said.
The SNL program began with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star exclaimed Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate jury on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the video from West's export was sent to social media through Chris Rock's comedian.
It's not known if Rock wanted to mock West by putting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're getting on me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
The West continued: “Do you think I have no exit?” by adding: “I will establish a supermen’s cape, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept."
His words twice called for “buying” by the audience, and the SNL team members looked embarrassed — reports Variety.
West was invited to the program as replacement singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has been intrigued by many works I Love it in changing the bottle of Perrier.
West has received support from the Conservative Head of TPUS, Candace Turner, who has included the following tweet: "To one of the most important: I wish you to give your MAFII".
The talk talk show Karen Hunter on her Twitter said that West simply "was himself and it is absolutely wonderful".
“But I will NOT reward anyone (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her “pieces”), which I think accepts and spreads harmful to my community of ideology.
He's free.
We're free, too," she added.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was already "formally called Kanye West".
But he is not the first artist who changed his name — following the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friend of the rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name to the symbol, and then an earlier artist known as Prince.

Star Games about the throne Kit Harington addresses the issue of toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in a villaged at the time of the medieval HBO series.
31-year-old actor hit a stereotype of the hero macho, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
In his interview of Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that " something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the game plan for the throne, a 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he was feeling “it’s sure enough” by moving this issue.
“Is it enough for me to feel quite at this point — where we made a mistake in the subject of masculinity? ” he said.
"What did we teach men during their growing, looking at the problem we are dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic manhood may be partly responsible for television due to the appearance of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what things are taught?
What learns on TV and on the streets, what makes young boys think they have to stand on a specific side to be a man?
I think that is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It is obvious that everything is not all right with young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel Game of the throne after the end of the series in the following year, saying that he was “ending with the fields of battle and horses”.
From November, Kit will be playing in the art of "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
Actor recently said that he thought he knew his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him in the game about the throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emma's fantasy show, Rose, played the Ygritte, an object of love interest in Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in HIV-infected people suffering from AIDS.
There are over 820 000 people affected by this problem, as the health workers of the country report.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which means a change to the past.
Traditionally HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health officials said at the conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to one year to another, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is common.
Given the country's conservative values, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease portability are due to insufficient safeguards when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters contradicts the fact that one of her team members revealed the senators of the Republican Party — these are "insecurity lies" and "conspiracy theory".
A member of the House of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday as a member of her team to include the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia web pages in the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democrat Party ensured that these charges were filed by experts and websites associated with "ultra-right wing".
"The lies, lies, and even more wicked lies," she communicated Waters in her Twitter statement.
Public information was similar to home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was placed by an unknown person on the capitol during the interview of the panel in the Senate on sexual offences against the nominee before the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took some time to question Kavanaugh's candidate for three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the post source was linked to the Waters office and published information on the Waters team’s member, as Hill says.
“This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie”, Watter continued.
“My team’s body — identity, personal data, and security have been breached as a result of the fraud and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless charge is completely false and it's a hundred percent lie."
Waters' statement quickly caused criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer — the former White House spokesperson.
"This is the way of denial," wrote Fleischer.
“It suggests that there is no appropriate temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of the person making the charge.
He must remain calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of manifesting excessive anger during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican launch candidate for mid-term elections in order to replace Waters' position, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A whole thing, if that's true," he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraud charges".
"The lawyers will be demolished and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions, which pose a threat to any of my team members," she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — spy parody with weaked Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new movie with the British thread has already become a standard. This seems to be true for a new part of the series of films of action and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivate".
Will it become a new export goods of the country?
In any case, the eternally surprised face with a rubber face, incompetent Johnny English again received the license for partying — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is a expanded comic work designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who, despite his strange likeness to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a splatter of Jasia Beani and a drop from this guy who added one note to the Chariots of Fire theme for the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-class man — Atkinson once played in forgotten TV commercials in Barclaycard, where he left chaos for himself.
In the latest Johnny English video, there are one or two moments worth of attention.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the blades of the rotor.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson to physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since, at present, "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible, they offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humoral elements seem rather to be directed to children instead of adults — I think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and consistent as the gigs in the small Atkinson films about Jasius Bean.
It's always the current assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyberhaker passes to the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British operatives in the field — to the fear of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitterness of the prime minister, which is a pumpy character that is already suffering from a nervous breakdown due to a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, instilling into Theresa May's form, but the script doesn't give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her intelligence consultants tell her that, because of disclosure of the identity of all active spies, they will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English in its own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent — a few good gags during spying lessons by English.
English is called to Whitehall for dereliction, reconnecting with his ex-Bough helper, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man in connection with a submersible commander — a happy but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin partyage in the secret service of Her Majesty are returning to action, meeting a beautiful femme fatile of Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously controlled by a charismatic millionaire-maniac who claims he can solve the UK’s computer problems — Jason Volt’s villain, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crunt of absurd situations: dressed as waiters set up a French restaurant; they put chaos into the deck of a luxury Volta yacht; and English sows the desolation while using a set to virtual reality to learn from the interior of the Volta house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite nice and musical performance, the whole film looks very similar to the TV for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist thinking: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
Working party denyes that it has developed a plan that provides for the British four-day working week for which they will receive remuneration for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's work party will consider introducing a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, getting paid for five days.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to give savings to employees obtained from a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that the idea of this "integrates" in the economic program of the party and the country's exit plans to meet employees.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way of using workers to change the economy.
The older member of the Labour Party in the talk of The Sunday Times said: “It is expected that by the end of this year there will be a announcement of policy change.”
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-day working week is something that is included in the party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed to a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Ombudsman of the Labour Party said: “The last week of work is not party policy and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, used last week's work conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "spekulants" in public utility companies.
The plans from the shadow office also mean that current water companies can not recover from their participation because the Labour Government could make a ‘reduction’ on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the board of directors and create inclusive ownership funds in order to transfer 10 percent of the equity to private workers who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are responsible for the "60 minutes" program to ask if the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case can make them change their attitudes.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised a question of whether the findings of the investigating office could force Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a interview conducted on Sunday, running the program "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“By going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when that charge came along, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was strong, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be stoned.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and needed a strong charge to change her," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it", added Graham, returning to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the people she gives could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I think nothing will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival event and has contributed to a reduction in poverty in any way?
Global Citizen Festival will be held next Saturday in New York, an annual musical event able to boast an extremely impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission — the destruction of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is the destruction of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of actively fighting with it.
To get a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase VIP ticket), the participants had to do a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, making a phone or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen have in the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action or another case called “criminalism” when people feel they're doing something important, signing petitions online or putting an entry on Tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded in support of action supporters, in order to achieve many different objectives.
He also claims that these activities helped to encourage global leaders to deliver more than 37 billion dollars worth of commitments and provisions that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group entered into 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its activities, in which at least $10 billion was paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Realists involved in helping children to achieve their full potential, which promised to hand Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in this country, after Global Citizens sent over 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition to history" — Tracey Ulman, Ambassador to Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on Great Britain to improve the quality of nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on your website, which sounded like, "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?"
Global citizen responded as follows: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fight and fail.
But as in the case of the earlier great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars of this year's event in New York, which will host Deborra-Lee Furnness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy for Russian energy exports to the "blocks" — Internal Affairs Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" escape to his Navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates in inviting the rule of law — was a pretext for the exploitation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is to promote energy trade, as in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States has the opportunity to make sure that the routes of the sea remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which himself defines as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia consists of using and replacing fuels" said, comparing Russia to "a piece known to one trick" with a fossil fuel economy.
This statement appeared at a time when Trumpa administration continues to pursue a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — much cheaper options for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump’s administrators, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadvertent" project of Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion underground meters, is an economic project only.
Kreml argues that the fervent opposition of Washington to the implementation of this project is due solely to economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", said Russian Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has led to a violent response from Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting by Chancellor Angeli Merkel with the president of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that after mid-term elections, they would consider running for the president.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren, she confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the wicked government, and this is also the high-ranking woman,” she said, “The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider my presidential candidate."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trumpie, saying that she would "go the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren, without a garden, expressed her criticism to Trumpa and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter, Warren wrote: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren voters do not think that she should be running for 2020.
Thirty-eight percent of the Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said the senator should not run as a result of the survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidate — 38 percent supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent were opposed.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account for potential candidates in 2020 were Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said she'd make the official decision until January, as she gave the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) of Track Palin during Donald Trump's electoral age
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, for which he has to go back, I understand other families that have consequences for the PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers are coming back," said the audience at Donald Trump's electoral age in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palan called the arrest of her son "a theme of taboo," and she said of her son and other war vets: "They are returning a little changed, they are coming back, wondering whether they will be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, pilots, and all other members of the army have given away their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla in Alaska and accused of domestic violence on a woman, impingeing false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of arms in a state that was sober, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 Colombia's states and districts support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
The 18 states and districts submitted a letter to Washington on Friday to support the asylum seeker, as NBC News says.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union was not disclosed in August.
She said that her partner “and his violent sons from the gang” was harassed by her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's been detained in Texas.
The prosecutors in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries that are suffering from common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has repealed the decision of Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum against domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Colombia's District, said on Friday's statement that a new policy "respects state, federal and international law for decades."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle", as described in the amicus curiæ list.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy that refused immigrants to enter harm the US economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "a necessary working force".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges to cease asylum for victims of domestic violence and those executed by gangs.
"Azil is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear against racial, religious, nationality or because of belonging to a specific social group or with such and not other political convictions" said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
He was never intended to solve all the problems — even the serious — with which people from all over the world struggle every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu in a situation where the number of deaths doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
It became more tragic for the survivors.
"This is a very intense feeling," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, comforting her angry son in the evacuation center of Palu.
"A minute and a half, an ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to the destroyed homes, searching the watered things and trying to save everything they could find.
There were hundreds of people wounded, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, quickly overrun.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a vertebral fracture of the spine and arm, rested outside of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears, as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shocked the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I guess I was stuck in a Romanian wall," Haris said the Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife cry for help, and then her voice shut down.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "injury" commercial advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in the American newspaper that commends the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily’s paying allowance in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the elections to the United States Congress that will take place on 6 November — China is denying this charge.
Trumpa's attack on Beijing's attempt to interfere with the US elections confirmed what American officials told Reuters that this is a new stage in escalating the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington now lead to an escalation of trade war that has led to an increase in tariffs for imports.
Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump’s Party — found Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former former Governor of the State of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that “now China is starting with double force, putting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government uses the respected tradition of freedom of speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register, ” says Branstad.
In the kiosk on Beijing street there will be no opposition and there will be no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction that China is defending, given that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party" - he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans conjure each other against mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and weapons nominated for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s efforts to carry out his recent investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will not forget it by November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson of the National Progressive Group MoveOn, as the newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters would scan for the password "The New Year's Eve", demonstrating in the Senate lobby due to the determination of the Republicans controlling the Court of First Instance in order not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, as he gave Mic.
"The concept of democratic enthusiasm and motivation is beyond the scale" said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“ People say he was already tall — and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among the undecided women of the pre-department and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before a public statement by Ford, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault directed at the address of a candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidate, this would be a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party must deal with a small mess,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of committee or final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also the way in which the Republicans managed this situation and how the Ford treated it", said on one of Guy Cecil's news channels, the US Priority Director, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided into those who believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter slightly greater support.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony was definitely or rather believed.
In addition, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying during the submission of statements, while only 30% claimed the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure started an investigation into Ford's charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath to the Senate of the Court of First Instance that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia during her graduation at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web Network creator, launches a startup which is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project by the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what persons have access to specific information.
In an interview for exclusiveness for Fast Company Beners-Lee, he was joking that the purpose of creating Inrupt was to "domestication over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the launch.
"It's just a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "Webshop with Personal Data" or otherwise.
It may include contact lists, list of things to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of an Internet store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it a personal asset through the data.
According to the CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed in the project and the development community.
From this week forward, technology makers across the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will be turned upside down from day to day by all their business models.
"I'm not asking their permission."
In a media platform published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid Network."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has done a lot in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
By calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next age in network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Honorary Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which, during World War I, was awarded the Cross of Victoria, was attended 100 years later in his home town.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Bellenglis and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was decorated with the highest British military order.
On Saturday his two grandkids exposed a stone remembered during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that putting the stone away exactly on the centenary of his grandfather's title was "excellently symbolic".
As London Gazette reports, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battle through the Saint-Quentin Channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong force of field and machine weapons”.
He then speeded up on the line of fire and the "most courage" he led it forward, and he singlely launched an attack on the field department, destroying three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I would never be able to cope with, but also something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made an incarceration after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to take part in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero manifests itself in the support received from many people.”
The MMA fans didn't burn all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got Świnka Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch the Bellator 206 outspoken emotions and finally not be able to see the main struggle.
The gala program in San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main tab, and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of the program for the Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they didn't sleep until early morning hours specifically to see this fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the conversion to a cartoon for children as "you're a sick joke."
"In accordance with the regulation of the Government, the content of this type is inappropriate to leave it at 6 a.m., so it was necessary to change the program for children", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication of Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Swine, yes."
Bellator, Scott Coker, President of the Bellator Organization, said they were working on a schedule to take the viewers in the UK into account in the future.
"When I think about the renegade, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it is Sunday six in the morning, so that we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, there was a lot of comments that none of which were friendly.
We were trying to fix it... we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation will not happen again.
We are going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to a standard amount, and we were too keen to please the fans, and unfortunately, we have overtaken it.
This is unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic drop in the water, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but he gave him a motivation to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs station Radio 4, run by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about gay rights to give others a hope.
He also said that he was going to be a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual run of this program for many years, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As he appeared in the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up felt “less valuable” from others, because “one-stopping of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “To this day this feeling of less value and being one is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth something, not disappointing everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist has become a loud activist of the LGBT community and has used his performance at this year's United Nations Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he had decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and in this way he wanted to give others hope.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man — the American producer named Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 “he was surprised. ”
Daley married Oscar's winner (which is 20 years older) last year, stating that such a age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age, ” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death for cancer three years later, he said that he was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
There was a baby couple in June named Robert Ray Black-Dody. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"The most important thing last year was to get me a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had already had tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 — he wanted to take place in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him: “You won’t be with us in order to be in the first row, Dad”, he said.
"I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing, only when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not invincible" - he said.
Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew this was what I dreamed of all my life — jumping to the water from the crowds of people in the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling I could have ever dreamed of,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud in Heather Small — which accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and which continues to make him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is emitted at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Shows a lack of Mickelson form on the bench during the Saturday section of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday, when it's playing his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but she'll have to work on her form so she won't cut off her heel.
Mickelson, who played for twelve times every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk at the time of Saturday's Fourball and Foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often happened in his case in the team of the United States, the five-time main winner had to spend the day of the team-supping and working to improve his game in the hope of fixing his cause for putting him back on the bench.
A 48-year-old who had never given the simplest hits, even at the peak of his career, does not work well on the tight field of Le Golf National, in which mistrusts are seriously punished by long payers.
And if the field itself is not disincentive enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, it must face the precision of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with Tommy Fleetwood's debut to win all four matches this week.
If Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) begin the game with a vervain, the Mickelson match may be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his player — he could not do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me in the back, took me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow” — Furuk said.
“ He is very confident.
It is in the gallery of fame and has brought much to play its teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how we got to do it anyway.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which has never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories on his account, 20 failures and seven remissions. Furuk said that his presence brought much to the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, witty, funky, and it’s good to have it in the team’s room,” he explained.
"I think young players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings his person much more than just a game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from the experience that a major starting point before the singles begin on the last day Ryder Cup can easily transform into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where along with his accompanying Vice President Sevem Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the meth line was shortest of possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It is not possible to forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in the case of Valderama we won only the Italian field," said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, which gave driving 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you're giving yourself everything.
Get out there and do whatever it takes.
The end will only be when there are points on the board.
We have a target to get the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
From the outset, I have been focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the opposite side — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, thrilled by how his competitors managed on a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Singles are starting tomorrow, and that's another thing.
It's good to play with your partner when it's all after thought, but when you play single, your golf skills are tested to the limits of possibilities.
It's a message that needs to be sent to players, and it's going to give you everything tomorrow.
The partner must also give all of himself."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results in a single game than when playing with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced the great returns of the last day, being a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then failed after the European team made a "cud in the Medinah field".
"I remember every word", he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“We’re playing 12 important games tomorrow — you want to start playing at a fast pace as it happened in Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our composition and set the boys in a way that would enable us to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was the task of bringing counterattacks against Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other players of the European team in the top half of the programme.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he's going to be able to handle himself during all the games", said Bjorn about his single choices.
The new German warship delayed again
The most recent Fregata of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty arrangements and rising at an alarming rate of costs, such as local media.
The reference to the use of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit gave to the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the 2014 Navy, but as a result of the problems that occurred after delivery, changes were needed in this ambitious project.
Four units of Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing ferrets of the Bremen class.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and counter-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance — operation of new ferrets should be possible for up to two years from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that these modern warships, which are to allow Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be old enough at the start of service — recorded Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 Fregata appeared on the first pages of the newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
It was not known much about the reasons behind the return, but the German media informed about a series of key "no software or equipment" that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, which is half less than the age of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to implement future modernizations.
The weighted 7000 tonnes of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including crew training.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) while the initial cost was worth EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with putting forward new fregats are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that the power of the German sea fleet is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the sailors “will end with ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem over time increased as a result of the withdrawal from the exploitation of old vessels without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
The new studies carried out in the area of the Highlands in Scotland aim to show how bats use the landscape during food.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future efforts to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will concern the Carlicians of common and minors, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the families of the Red Wverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the estate, special registrators will be deployed to track the activity of bats in the field.
Staff and volunteers of NHS will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how the individual species behave.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection advisor in the NTS, hopes that results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are at risk for construction and development works that have an impact on the heads and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a risk, as well as fly blinds and certain chemical products used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night - day fishing habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching conquerors.
They use a complex technique of echoing for the search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts, who regularly carry out tests, control of the head and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even established its first and only reserve for bats on the territory of the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of the 10 Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the property manager, says it's for bats the perfect territory.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still a lot of ignorant people, as far as bats are concerned, the work we do here and in other estates will help us understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of control in terms of bats before the arrival of maintenance work in the estates, as the unintentional destruction of one head can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by killing, harassing or disturbing them, and destroying their heads is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and in many species we do not even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue the German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the charges against him concerning rape as "fake news", saying that people "wanted to promote", using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information warehouse Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese Juventus attacker was charged with rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the announcement of charges, in an instagram live message addressed to his 142 million followers, identified these reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are facte news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's okay," he added a footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel warehouse for the charges they called "inadvertently reporting suspicions in the area of privacy" — as Reuters says.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount that is likely to be one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years”.
It took place in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorg’s night club, they reportedly went to a footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped a woman anallystly — according to the documents in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged attack and told her that in “99 percent he was a good guy,” who was introduced by this “one percent”.
According to Ronaldo's records, the couple had sex, but it was for mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extradition agreement because she was afraid of retaliation and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says he wants to cancel the settlement now, because he still can't forget the alleged incident.
During the alleged assault, Ronaldo passed from Manchester United to the Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying for him 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “after all times would regret” leaving car manufacturers
After leaving the European Union, the UK would “serve it all the time” if it had lost its world leader’s status in the production of cars, the Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "consistent with him" when a member of Toyota UK in an interview for the BBC said that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the production in a plant in Burnaston near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to other European countries.
"I think that if the UK comes out of the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then there will be a halt in production in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without any agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns — as car manufacturers claim — the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of leaving the European Union to Great Britain without an agreement.
The Toyota Production Line operates on the "just-in-time" principle in which parts reach 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of vehicles produced on the order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles to the border, which, according to industry, can lead to delays and weaknesses of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, so the production would be suspended.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border control".
“We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the present success, but also allow us to make the right use of this situation” said Radio 4 in today’s programme.
"Acquisitions not only of Toyota, but also of other producers show that we must be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient set of supply chains".
Toyota’s representative could not determine how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Board of Works of the Union, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs end up, they will never be restored.
The Ombudsman said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Meeting Trumpa with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as White House says.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "reported for another week" due to the ongoing fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as he gave on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's work, who's investigating the possibility of interference by the Russians in the election, the link between the close colleagues of Trumpa and Russia and the potential impedement of judicial action by the President.
The fact that Trump has been released by the Deputy Attorney General, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot subject in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about wearing wires to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president from his position on 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied those reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a meeting to avoid collide with the Senate Court hearing during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News Station.
When asked for a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved by another week, taking into account all the events relating to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll be sure to report it to the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not conducted a White House press conference since 10 September.
The running program, Chris Wallace, asked about the cause.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences was not due to an indiscretion of TV journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentacy".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President, the President, is doing more "study and answers" than any other president before him," said he, without giving evidence, "We met with numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but “if journalists have the opportunity to direct the appointment of the President of the United States of America’s questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly and in the last few weeks we have done this very often. Press conferences will give way to places such sessions in which you will be able to speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with goggles.
Salt press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York City, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the meeting journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexite-related concerns
The Minister of Health has made use of the letter to workers from the European Union who are employed in the Scottish health service to express their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for "stoxided status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The summer negotiations on the exit of the UK from the European Union continued. The relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The UK Government has also intensified the preparation for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing period for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciated the contribution of every staff member, irrespective of his nationality.
The EU-wide and non-EU colleagues have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health work and bring benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of a head injury.
The charming Tennessee State Tigers syndrome, Christie Abercrombie, has undergone an operation as a result of a head trauma in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a failure of the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, informing Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, Chief Team Coach Tennessee State, told the journalists that the player suffered trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the sideline, and then he went down to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then put it on their noses and took it to carry out further tests.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operating in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details of the nature/emporence of the trauma,” and Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a student of the second year released from the representation of a university for a year to test his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match he had five greys, which gives him 18 greys all over the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fee when buying real estate in Great Britain
According to the new plans of the buyer's Tories from abroad, higher tax fees on the purchase of real estate in the UK will be charged.
This move is intended to destroy Jeremy Corbyn's success with the aim of attracting a young electorate.
The increase in tax charges will cover non-taxable persons in the UK.
The Ministry of the Treasury expects that this will amount to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May is going to announce today that foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged with a higher fee and thus additional funds will be available to the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young elector into cheaper homes and increase the burden of more earning people.
Higher tax charges will apply to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK. Additional measures will help the government to combat homelessness.
The additional fee, calculated in addition to the current tax rate, including two years ago higher rates for second homes and rental homes, may be charged at a rate of up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects this shift to be able to reach 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and difficulties in purchasing the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estates, and most of them spend their time out of the country, many wealthy regions — especially the capital — turned into “the city of spirits”.
The new rules come in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a tax reduction to help young people purchase their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by handling the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to put an end to the limits of low-cost housing in order to eliminate the "house scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the eviction "without reason".
He also wants to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as Prime Minister, I will be engaged in the reconstruction of the British dream of making life of every next generation better than the previous.
This also means repairing our busy housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that those who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard as working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home became very remote, for this humiliation related to the need to stay on the street remains beyond real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to be a Scottish selecter"
Team coach Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to be a Scottish selecter at some point.
This 40-year-old Scotland is committed to healing the North-East, which is currently third in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he introduced the St Mirren club back to Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a professional,
But I only managed to get to staff B," said Ross in an interview for the BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched with the father of a Scottish game in Hampden, and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a coach of the club."
Among Ross’s predecessors, Dick Advocacyt, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canoio were among the predecessors.
Former coach Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel obnoxious, taking over the role of such well-known personalities in such a large club, rejecting previously the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success will be measured for me at present if I can bring this club back to Premier League.
Taking into account his structure and the comfort he has at his disposal, his place is undoubtedly there," he adds.
"To do this will not be easy, but I will probably feel that I have succeeded here, only if I can do it."
Ross’s coaching career is only three years old. Before that, he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton, and for 15 months he was a team of coaching Hearts.
He then helped Alloa again after degraded to the third league, and in the next season he led the team St Mirren from the edge of falling to the title of the champion.
Jack Ross claims he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than he did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was a true turning point, ” says Coach Allo’s position.
“I truly believed that running a team would be a lot better suited to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because as a player, I've done well, I've made good money, and I've achieved some tangible successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to get through different situations.
They still happen to me when it comes to stress and pressure on coach's work, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say that right now I feel the most in my entire adult life."
All of the interview in Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30th at Scotland radio between 12:00 and 1:00 BST time
Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. Saturday
Summer heat wave caused a violent influx of customers to British pubs, but it hit the restaurant's nets.
Studies have shown that in July the sale in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “The warm heat and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results from July to be similar to the June when the turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings fell even more.
In June 1,8 % of the sales in restaurants in July increased.
Pubs and bars offering drinks have been much better served — their sales growth has increased the decline recorded in restaurants.
Food mouths also suffered during the heats, although not as much as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6% this month and the food decreased by three percent".
“ These are the results that we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of consumption 'over home' remain the weather and big sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks survive difficult times, not surprising, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if you take into account continuous pressure on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favourable moment for owners of food and time serving places to show if a little more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary reassurance."
The total increase in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One for five children has secret accounts in social media that hide from parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some at the age of 11— have secret social networking accounts that hide from parents and teachers
The survey made among 20,000 pupils of upper secondary schools showed an increase in the number of pages "fake Insta"
These messages raised concerns that sexual content was published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account that showed parents
One for five children — some of them at the age of 11 — establish social accounts that do not reveal to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 students of upper secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts — the name refers to Instagram, in which you can share photos.
These reports raised concerns that these accounts serve to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students have admitted that they have a reputable “main” account that shows their parents and that they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally encountered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who told others to "be raped".
A study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK Agency and the Headmasters Association" and Headmistdresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 are running two profiles. Half of them are granted to maintain private accounts.
HMC, Mike Buchanan, President of the HMC association, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will become the sportsman's voice in the board of Scottish Athletics
At the Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle's annual management meeting, she was elected to the Management Board as a director of non-execution.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled high school girl. President Ian Beattie has identified this as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect for Scottish, British and world-class lightletts and we are confident that the introduction of Scottish lightletie to the board will bring great benefits” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased that I will have the opportunity to give a message to athletes council, and I hope I will be able to really help with the management of sports in Scotland.”
An American, who, among his four gold Olympic medals, has a victory at 200 and 400 metres in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot be a result of a transient bleeding attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it would be time to see if I could recover and to what extent.
It was an orderly job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your support words!"
Lactators' advertising, which compares mothers to cows, causes extreme emotions on the Internet
The Lactator company has triggered a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares mothers breast-feeding to milked cows.
In order to announce the launch of the “first silent lacquer in the world to wear under clothes”, his producer, Elvie, published a scrumpting advertising in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It presents four real mothers dancing in a completed haystack to a song where you hear the words "Yes, I get it, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits that's changed."
And as Refren goes: "Pamp them, wash them, feed them, and feed them children, and wash them, and let them go, I will deliver your lords."
The advertising that was published on the company's Facebook page has caused large controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77 000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many say it is inappropriate to joke from the "horror" that is happening in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they must become pregnant and give birth to calves, except that their children are taken away from them a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie Lactator can be worn unnoticed under feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cow to advertise lactating for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: “This ad is completely detached from reality. ”
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women said that her song was “funny. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast feeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was pulling food.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for another bottom.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a fun advertising directed to mothers who stretch food (sometimes in work or toilet) and feel like a 'creary'.
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry."
At the end of the movie it turns out that women danced with lactatings attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, Lactator Elvie is completely quiet, there are no cable or pipes and you can wear it unnoticed under a feeding bra, which gives women freedom to move, keep children on their hands, or even leave the house while taking food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mather, said: “The Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved to be a courageous and provocative prime minister.
By putting together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges that are associated with eating food, presenting in a funny and coherent way an incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time Elvie's lactating hit the front of the papers.
During the London Fashion Week during the Marty Jakubowski show, the mother of two children with this very product appeared on the run.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas.
The number of children detained by immigrants is increasing rapidly, although the number of persons crossing the border does not change much every month, which is due partly to the fact that the strict rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump’s administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report for the child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adults living in the common holding will be taken fingerprints that will then be transmitted to immigration offices.
Last week, an older official in the agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who submitted themselves as sponsors for children left careless.
The Agency confirmed later that 70 % of the arrests were not previously listed.
“The nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in a country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we keep chasing them," Albence said.
The shelter workers say that, in order to accelerate the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as has been done in accordance with previous standards.
A lot will be made through videoconference, not personally, to ask the judge of immigration to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for release shall be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and the reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or fall into depression, which in turn could lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to miss the signals that something bad happens with the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without providing them with sufficient time to prepare emotionalally or to say goodbye to friends could increase the trauma that many of them already face.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During the statement before the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, even though war in this country is already eight years.
Moral, who also plays the role of Vice-President, said that foreign forces are illegally present on Syrian soil, under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and "let us deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally" said the Assembly.
Moualem claims that "the war with terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
She says that Damascus will continue to "go to his holy battle until it is cleaned up the territory of Syria" both from terrorist groups and from "all foreigners who are illegally staying on it".
There are currently around 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who are mainly involved in training the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and counseling them.
Moreover, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the destroyed war country.
With regard to refugees, Moual stated that the conditions are good enough for them to return, and accused "some western countries" of "inclusive fear" that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They policyise matters that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that, as long as President Assad does not conclude with the opposition of political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any recovery aid.
The UN conspiracies say that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large bastion of rebels in Idlib has created the possibility to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped prevent Russia from having a large Syrian power attack on a province in which three million people live.
Moual stressed, however, that the agreement had a "explained time frame" and expressed the hope that the military action would be carried out in jihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaida Front of the Levant People's Defense, who would be "explained".
The UN emissary, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon attend the first meeting of the new committee composed of members of the governing party and opposition to develop a sketch of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Most of them have laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "to verify the records of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for his second term of office in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency will end up removing from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency" so far.
So far, there's no sign of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, the results of the CNN channel ratings in the prime time have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers and the MSNBC channel — almost tripled up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, 2.4 million viewers were attracted to the highest ratings, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" program "The Rachel Maddow Show" was the highest performer in cable TV, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
“People fly like a moth to a fire — that’s something we don’t understand” — said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series “Designed Survivor” about the secretary of the office, who after attacking the Capitol becomes president.
Nell Scovell, experienced creative comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truth About Sneating Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
It mentions how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trumpa.
“Why? ” she asked.
“ Because he makes me laugh, ” he said.
"Chaos has entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, move on Roe v. Wade's future, on the admissibility of combining immigrants' families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you're looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's secret informants when writing Paul Manafort's jacket from the skin of struse for $15,000 (the pride-laundering clothing), as said The Washington Post) or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomia revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
“What he does is partly like reality shows in this respect that every night he delivers new content” – said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about changing stock and daily stock returns show Trumpa (like attack on NFL league players or praise by Kim Djong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you'll have a backlog.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai, where she has her home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh just stood before the Senate Court and weighed the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember, as we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were kidding, but it turns out they were right."

The flow of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that, after the reorganisation of the constituency, two present-day congressmen, the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania flows a river of cash.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburgh represents a representative of the Democrats in Congress, Conor Lamb, who received his seat in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republic of Keith Rothfus representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely covers the new district 17.
The district maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were assigned unfairly, which gave rise to an advantage to the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district of 17 began to fight for the funding of the campaign between the main funding bodies of the parties — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb’s name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the hair in widely commented elections to the 18th constituencies held in March.
The Republican has been sitting in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in this district.
Politic experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn this idea.
Diploms have noted that Dominicans and Panama have already accepted Beijing, despite the slight opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the management team's partners had a hotel in Panama.
The authorities of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decision to cease Taiwan’s recognition, as the spokesman of the department, Heather Nauert, said in her statement.
However, sanctions were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $ 140 million of assistance from the United States for the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to limit financial assistance and grant visas to certain persons, would be very touching for this Central American country, which is facing a high unemployment rate and a high rate of murder.
In the light of the progress of the meetings, international officials of North and Central America have put forward a high-level conference to address the safety and economic well-being of the United States in order to address the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which has been seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus reducing any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomics say that now at a conference which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to appear, which is to be a sign of invitation to the assembly of the representatives of the administration.
Three American envoys came back quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominicans, and there were no new strict messages or punishments from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesperson from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debates that were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal destinations.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration's environment, which also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible difficulty in judicial action by President Trumpa, on what is currently concrete evidence available in public.
According to the reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examines whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with the attack on the American election.
If Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him during preparations for reintroduction before the voters, and he may even be tried before the jury.
There are a lot of ignorant people here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trumpa — or those on equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic need to make a choice that will decide how much longer this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute the coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the possibility to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History railways turn around such feedback points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are several such feedback in front of the Americans right now.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires the Attorney General Rosenstein, the man who depends on Robert Mueller's future investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he proposed a secret video of the president and speculated that he wasn't fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inexcusable.
"How will we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court judge despite his credible sexual assault accusations and false testimony?
First of all, are we going to the Congress of the people who are responsible for Donald Trumpa in the middle of our term of office?
If we don't go through these trials, there's gonna be a lot of time for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman, she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my ambassador residence.
She lived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the devils' candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Having a legacy like that, how could I not look at the future optimisticly?"

Rangers, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for a game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory with the Austrians, obtained after an impressive draw from Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying with the G League of Europe.
Until 2:2 dated Villareal, knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers as trampoline to greater successes.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape" - said 31-year-old.
“ We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something — and we fought the point.
At the end, we may have been able to squeeze them still, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, it's another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can score three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has obtained a good score in his last match, but I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and we will win the positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything about my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good at our places.
Team's great, and boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends women's sleep with her eyes
Even though those involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted them to be taken care of, few had talked to their family about it.
In a study by Nationvideo, about half of the participants stated that she had spoken to her spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the company Nationwide selling life insurance.
Where do you want to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will earlier.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want to take care of yourself, because this choice will be an important factor in determining your costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy on such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses or from your own property, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent judicial battles.
Choose a trusted health attorney who will oversee her and ensure that the right persons behave according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you can't do it alone.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is going to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medicines and allergies?
I want you to get all the information you need to know to have it ready.
“This is not just about the finances, but about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan like this."
Man has been shot several times from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot many times from the windmill when he came home from the evening party.
Forty-year-olds were located in Oxford Grove, Devon County Ilfracombe, near Oxford Grove, when they were shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police have identified a shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as a "emergency action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries suffered do not threaten a man's life.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the city of Pal on Friday.
Due to the severe communication to rescue workers, no information from the Donggala cabupaten, which is located north of Pal, has been reached, closer to the earthquake epicentre with a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the Pala disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about Palu and Kabupatenia Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The palace is the capital of Celebes Central Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates, 379 800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and the tsunami occurred, the city just held its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over 300 km long.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299 200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coast of the Cabupatenia Donggala.
Another source of the province's income is nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebesu.
According to the Indian Agency, Catastrophy's quacks have visited Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years of earthquakes and tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Nine people died in 1996 as a result of the tsunami in West Donggali.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific Fire Ring, making earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The large earthquake, which on 26 December visited the western coast of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: By the end of March and early April the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias at the Sumari coast.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 8.8 degrees, causing tsunamis that occurred in the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Padang, West Sumatra capital, a 7.6-degree earthquake, took place.
More than 1100 people died as a result of this.
2010: The earthquake hit one of Mentawai's islands not far from the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jay's kabupaten in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction that was fatal in the impact of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 men killed the fighting buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes visited the island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of houses and caused temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sara Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested under assault charges.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla, Alaska, 29-year-olds were arrested with domestic violence, hindering the submission of an application and the resistance to arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
The KTU Station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a 500-dollar bail.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before a court where in his defense speech he said he was “is certainly innocent. ”
Three class A offenses are pregnant in Palinia, which means she can receive even a year's sentence and $250,000 fines.
He was also accused of committing Class B, for which he was threatened by the day of prison and fines of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal charges are being filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palan.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaskan Veteran Court of Appeal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, hindering the submission of a notification and the possession of weapons in a state that was sober in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sara Palin, which linked the aggressive behavior of the son with the post-traumatic stress syndrome that he received during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died following the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of the fifth earthquake that visited the island of Celebes.
Earthquake with a force of 7.5 has caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located on the north east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media has films showing a moment of disaster.

Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York demand the death penalty for Sayfulll Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in eight people dead. It is a rare punishment — not executed in that state for a federal offense since 1953.
To execute an attack that took place in October on the West Side Highway bicycle path in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used the rental truck home Depot, which ran the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification made in the southern district of New York about the intent to demand death penalty in order to justify its need, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "totally" killed eight victims and "totally" caused serious damage to the body.
According to the court document, both charges are threatened by a death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal attack, the jury was presented to Saipov by an act of prosecution covering 22 positions, including eight charges for murder in the course of illegal activity — a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the D.A., it required "solid planning and thinking." The way Saipov performed it, they defined it as "serious, cruel and immoral".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought harm, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholasa Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Diego Mendoz and Alejandra Damian Pagucca,” states the announcement.
Five of the victims were Argentina's citizens who were staying in New York.
Last time a death penalty in the southern district of New York was brought ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was the last time performed in New York in 1953 at Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years had previously been declared guilty of conspiracy and spy to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's judicial records, which came from Uzbekistan, he did not show a guilty conscience within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he's fine with what he did.
In line with Saipov's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he was watching on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded that ISIS flag be delivered in his hospital room.
The file of accusations involving 22 charges says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in the office representing Saipova, said that they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the D.A.'s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release from the guilt will only extend the suffering that these events have brought to all the persons concerned" - he said.
Saipova's team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand death penalty.
The parliamentary officer on the Tories says that NIGEL FAAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
Former leader of the UK’s independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must “be hot” from Eurosceptics when one of the parliamentarians of Theresa May suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Reputed from the Conservatives' Hand, Peter Bone, told the demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage were the Secretary of the Brexitus, "The United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the tories for staying in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, has further stressed the burden of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, which is before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to achieve his plan of compromise from Chequers among the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, his opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and lairists to choose between her proposal and her "chaose".
Peter Bone said that the Leave Means Leave in Solihull said he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did this, we would now be out of the Union," he said.
Disputed from Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we need to throw a plan out of Chequers".
In presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought for this in world wars in order to be subject to anyone now.
We want to have our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens changed their sentence from the vote in 2016: “He thought that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay in the Union is completely incorrect.”
There was also a supporter at the demonstration of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from a group of Tories who said to the reporters: “I am just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not pleased with the general support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who have chosen us, nor are they supporting it.
Leave the plan out of Chequers and start listening."
In her statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “The targets keep their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage stated that the politicians involved in the demonstration must “be warm” if they were to betray the 2016 referendum’s decision.
“Now this is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class” — he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you do it."
He added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the edge of the betrayal of Brexit feel hot.
"We are mobilizing the army of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, the opponents of Brexita marched through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A bunch of activists waved "Torys against Brexit" after the group was formed this weekend.
Activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, bold conservatives for security issues at the beginning of the conference.
“They are people who claim to be able to organize IT systems and whole technology for the operation of the Canada plus, liquid frontiers, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit."
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" candidate for president
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "will seriously consider running for the president".
As The Boston Globe reports, the Democrats' representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future when she met the voters on Saturday in West Massachusetts.

Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team’s command allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas was qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of the Mercedes team would have a significant impact on the result of the race.
The bottas, which began from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and force Vettel to attack his colleague from the band.
Vettel went to the service point as the first to let Hamilton ride in the tail of Peleton, which should decide the fate of the race.
Mercedes's opponent went down to the box in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel action in the wheel, which led the Ferrari driver eagerly left the inside part of the track, risking the defensic shift after the double movement of the rival to defend the position on the third corner, Hamilton went out on the drive.
Max Verstappen started at the end of his 21st birthday at the end of his first round he was in the seventh place.
Then, through a large part of the race, he led by not changing tyres to make a quick finish and taking Kimi Raikkonen fourth position.
Finally, he went to a point of service for the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps he failed to speed up.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The entire team gave it everything to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body talk.
During the meeting, which took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump made a mistake with Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed she didn't reveal the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission. Instead, he concluded that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "under, mutilated and lying".
“What may have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for several days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, wicked, and lying,” he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, have you revealed this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal" - he added, presiding the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents leaked early in September.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I did not reveal her history," she testified Feinstein in front of the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I did not reveal the content."
However, her statement was not convinced by the President, who commented on them during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, that was a really bad body story.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life."
Following the defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use innuencies for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over all means.
According to the report of Mediaite, the President has said that they are not concerned about who they have to destroy to take over power and control.

Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquakes
Air traffic controller from Indonesia was exclaimed as a hero after he died, helping the plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died, and many were found missing after a large earthquake that hit Celebes in Indonesia on Friday, causing tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. In Palu many people have been trapped in the rubbles.
Although his colleagues fled by saving their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonias Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in a lovely flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that the Batik Air Line (lot number 6321), which was on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he'd crash.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports by Air Navigation Indonesia ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, he said that the controller's decision had probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Bolippapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This message shattered our hearts” he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The National Agency for the eradication of disasters informs that the possibility of accessing Donggala, Simi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death continues to grow, because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached” said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The six-foot tsunami waves destroyed the Palu, where the mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said Sky News station: “Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
He's running out of drinking water.
Small stores are enticed."
John Gelfand, the Chief of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what will be left in place.
This is already a tragedy, and it could get even worse."
On Sunday, President Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu, who asked the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" – CNN reports.
This year Indonesia has already visited an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
The disaster of a plane in Micronesia — the Air Niugini line reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Air lines serving a flight that crashed on the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia informs that one person is missing. Before that, all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the toning aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon, one man could not count on the plane.
They assured that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests to provide additional details on a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, in rescue other passengers and crew members helped local boats.
Officials informed on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airline said there were six more passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It's not clear what caused the disaster, and it's not known exactly what happened to her.
Airline and U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he's out of a belt.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“This has helped us very much,” he said.
Jaynes said that he managed to get away with it, and that he was able to get through the water belt to get out of an emergency toning plane.
According to him, the cabin crew were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a dangerous head injury.
The United States Navy informed that the rescue operations also helped sailors who worked nearby on the modernization of the coastline. They managed to transport people on shore by means of a blowy boat before the plane sank to the depths of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the past two decades in the crash of aircraft belonging to the airline in Papua New Guinea, but Air Niugini is not involved in these lines.
Analyst refurbished events from night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. ended the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, has testified for many hours as a legal expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the route of a 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessie Chambers, from the night she died.
As Clarion Ledger reports, Rowlett said he had received location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the other night.
When the data confirmed that when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was in front of Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
Saturday Sanford testified he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Telllis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "I lied because my truck was back in Nashville."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records have shown that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Telllis died, he removed her contact details and texts and calls from his phone.
"He erased it from his life" said Hale.
The final message of defense is about to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.

Another black one?
Nanny from New York is suing a few for release after the "racist" text
Nanny from New York is calling on a couple to release her from work on a racist background after receiving a misrepresented text in which the mother of the child complains that she is a "other black person".
The couple deny that they are racists, comparing the lawsuits to "antance".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly grounded when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who was high on the first day of her work in 2016, was black.
“NEEEE, A COLEGEN OF THE FAMILY, ” wrote her text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she accidentally sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post reports, when Plasco-Flaxman realized she was aware of her physique, "cracked" released Gisella Maurice, claiming that a loving nanny, who was African-American, had failed to perform her duties, and besides that she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for her day of work, and then she was sent home to Uber.
Now he claims a few compensations for the exemption of 350 dollars a day multiplied by six months for which she was originally employed with a residence, although she did not sign a contract.
"I want to show them that things are not done," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple reject the accusations of racism, claiming that ending the cooperation with Mrs. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to talk to.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the Post husband, Joel Plasco.
“Will you entrust your children to the person you have made a mistake, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newly born child?
Come on."
By comparing the claim to the “cantage,” Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation”.
“Do you intend to blow something like this?
This is not very nice" – added an investment banker.
Although the case in the court has not yet ended, the public quickly issued a few sentences in social media, criticizing her for her behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books about PWTton were afraid that readers would not feel the connection with the talking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm adoption of the book, says: “It is hard to stand on the spot of the first person to read it before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Pitton."
He claims that her father, who, before a small plush bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was confident that his work would be rejected. He also added that after his death last 60th anniversary of the book release seemed "sold-gorzka".
As a “very important member of our family, ” he says that her father was proud of his success in secret.
“He was a quiet man, he did not brag” — he adds.
“ However, since Pintton seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel the pride of him, although it was not your responsibility.
I think that the success of Pitton felt that way about it.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always gave it to Pitton himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
“He called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t come out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart rate slowly stopped and were eliminated from the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit there and wait to know is that it's all going on.
I couldn't raise or scream, or cry because I was among other people.
I had to really stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who has already lamented the loss of her daughter, entered aboard with other passengers, unconscious of the torture she had passed.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head blown off, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on a plane, I felt a lot of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Puppies from women in mourning to help prevent suicides in the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to keep others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can get help from.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he got depressed.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day” — he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells us that her son was a well-announced cook with an infected smile.
“ Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he can brighten up every room."
But he quit his job before he died because he was “in a really black place”.
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old, and that's what he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid of domino effect."
Sharon Davis created a card, “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they are just friends.
Don't sit quietly — talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who for years has been friends with Sharon Davies, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“Nothing said that he felt depressed or sad or something” — he says.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He was already in a complete pit when the kids opened presents, not even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This is where a hole in the family takes place.
He's breaking us up.
But we have to keep living and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging in Italian because the FBI is launching an investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — an investigation of limited time and scope — perhaps we could achieve some unanimity,” said Jeff Flake, on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee “raves” on opposite camps, leading to an impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
They're all coming out of the moment.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans will lose them, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush already raised his phone to call the senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and made him meet Ashley's wife, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is uncertain whether Brett Kavanaugh will have at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and put him in the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's governments, the number of refugees from North Korea is decreasing.
According to South Korea's legislator, seven years ago, Kim Dong Un has taken over power, the number of persons fleeing from North Korea has fallen to South Korea.
Recognizing the data from the Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year and in 2011 — 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates taken by human smugglers.
Pjongjang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are ultimately proposed for the citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border was illegally exceeded by more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, so it is easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relations between the North and the South, and theoretically still in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the leaders of both countries met in Pjongyang, where there were discussions on the negotiations on denuclarisation which had previously been at a dead point.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trumpa, with Kim Djong Une, which took place in Singapore in June. The result is a general agreement to clear the Korean peninsula with nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on this issue.
"Without confidence with the United States, we will not be sure about our national security and in these circumstances there is no possibility for us to unification ourselves as first-hand" said Ri in his speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and said that by nature he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during the interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted this way, she would have been considered a 'hither'," Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave to the Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of alleged sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, when they were both teenagers.
At times during his preliminary speech Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also made clear Democrats from the committee, specifying the charges of "grotessy and coordinated coup on the reputation" organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if Kavanaugh would seek appeal from his office if he had received a nomination and if the Democrats had obtained most of the representatives in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say, "If he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not just sit in the Supreme Court, but also take office in the court in which he is currently working"" she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the district court of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugh was concerned about the law of the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade process because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During a confirmatory hearing, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time for us to enter the histeric court, a prejudiced person, who will expect us to say 'it is wonderful' — she added Pelosi.
And women have to catch her.
It's the right diatribe, the months, and years of tearing fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry” — Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “She helped me with a woman who was a manager in some company. She said that she too was crying when she was angry, but she imagined herself a way that when she was nervous and she starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘You know, I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as a part of the anger outlet because they are in principle mistakenly understood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in a man - dominated office is how I began to cry out of unexplained rage. A woman — a cold steering wheel I was always afraid of — took me behind her neck then and drove me into a stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you cry” — she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they've made up for you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then sentenced to Congress with Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business, he withdrew from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of self-cribing the president.
"It was not a thought-out decision" she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“The election had already become seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to this situation as "Snow White and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign has been on its way for a long time, Schroeder has been behind her fund collection and promised herself she wouldn't go to the race unless she could collect $2 million.
It was a battle sentenced to a loser.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to men, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she reported that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overly emotional — grateful for those who supported her, a frustration because of a system that made it so difficult to collect money and turn to voters, not delegates, and the anger of sexism — that her voice had put into her throat.
“You might think I’ve been through a nervous breakdown,” says the press’s reactions.
“ You might think I'm being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
'She cried? '
What can benefit Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China
The economic war between the US and China was extermination, and although the battle still continues, in the long term, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
The first warning launched this year the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on the key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new duty rates for goods worth £200 billion ($150 billion), which resulted in taxation of half of all goods entering the US from China.
Every time Beijing was in nature, raising recent duties on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US hit and it does not appear that the second economy in the world is about to fail.
To force Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but the public deviation of the head before the United States would be too embarrassing for president of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing has well played out its cards, the pressure of the US trade war could, in the long term, strengthen China by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the dispersion of economic chaos in one of the countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than observers have granted so far," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Syria is “preparation” for the return of refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country ruined as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress of fighting terrorism", he said.
To restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been fulfilled for refugees who have had to leave the country for terrorism and unilaterally shift their economic lives and means of living into their daily lives, to return to it voluntarily.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid provided or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe sealed up the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a score of 16,5 to 10,5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European land, the United States has already lost six times in a row and since 1993 Ryder Cup has not won Europe's Cup.
Europe regained its trophies when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it reached 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who, through most of the tournament, was not well, got the ball from the base directly to the water at the 16th pole of the PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was shiny through all rounds and became one of four players, which since 1979, when the tournament was first held in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by a 5&4 result by the lowest player in European ranking, Thorbjorn Oilen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the global ranking, lost two bucks before the last hole with Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last tournament Ryder Cup.
Europe's largest win in Ryder Cup was the Spanish Sergio Garcia, who had already taken part in eight tournaments and won 25,5 career points.
“Just don’t cry, but today I can’t stop myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm very happy to get my cup back.
It is a success of the whole team and I am pleased that I could help" – said Garcia, moved after winning the team from Europe.
It gives his family, John Rahm, who beat a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, as a result of 2&1.
“I feel an amazing pride in winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game” said Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has the results 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's an unusual statistics, like one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles, and he was just ending up with Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been having trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played really high throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing appearance of his American captain Jim Furuk, he said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're out of here.
Hats from the heads of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the organization of PGA of America and our Committee Ryder Cup, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the enemy.
They played a lot better than us."
