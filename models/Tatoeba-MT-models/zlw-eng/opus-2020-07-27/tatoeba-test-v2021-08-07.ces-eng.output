According to the Tueby Directives, it is recommended that members simply add sentences in their native language or translate from a language that understands, into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to put naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than native, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strangely. Please translate the sentence only when you know with certainty what it means.
