Eight-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
This week, the eight - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of a local store.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't think he's going to get hurt, and he adds: “He's finally started working out. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, a medical doctor's office.
The Sanfrance Police Department has informed that this is a violent death and an investigation takes place.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was previously a leading chef in Boston, got his dream job as chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman of Sons & Daughters' restaurant said they were "scaught and destroyed" his death.
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family, and we will miss it,” the spokesperson said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently, “he finally started working with him.”
"He found an apartment, walked with a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, he made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any arguments.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that shined every day," he said.

The Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the past six years, he has invested over 31 billion crowns of the state carrier to upgrade vehicles.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for the modernisation of each year, except for 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Over 31 billion crowns have been invested in modernising vehicles in the last six years.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown in a reduction in average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and six years in classic wagons.
A larger proportion of the investment was made by the carrier in regional transport, with about 60 percent of the money being spent, and 40 percent by the company invested in the renewal of the vehicles for long-term transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of driving vehicles of ČD would be increased by 10 years.
A little bit older are on average passenger wagons whose average age at the beginning of modernization is 23 years.
If only age was taken into account from the date of manufacture, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic kits composed of wagons and rolling locomotives in recent years, however, from both Czech and global railways gradually disappear and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015 there was a locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces, similarly the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the mid of this year.
In particular, the carrier was removed from old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without being able to block the opening during the drive.
From January to July, the carrier had to scrape 110 of these cars.
For example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres in an hour planned by the carrier to place on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic rail line.
The contract shall consist of a collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities in the fourth year know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, admit it.
About a quarter of the year, the editor of the online daily News.cz follows the story of the billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where it is not only an interesting walk in tree crowns but also an Olympic park.
The highway administrators know they're standing there black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of commercials all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a barbaric law for which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
They need them first for a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just need an ad to move a few meters and the official process has to start over.
The directorship of roads and highways four years ago admitted: on the main move from České Budějovic on Lipno stands on our property near the public road advertising billboard black.
Not more than three months ago, however, officials were sufficient to remove the unauthorized portable construction with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one would mind standing right next to the truck in a 50-meter protective zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road administrators say they can't simply deal with billboards because of the precious law.
Maybe put it on and take it away.
"We must not allow this to happen," says the spokesperson of the road and the highway Nina Ledvinová, and refers to a complex bureaucratic circle that needs to prevent billboard removal by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online daily At the moment.cz detailed follow in spring, while it is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot be addressed by the state and the authorities effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Bohemia the editor counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed right next to or near the car.
Similarly, other countries are involved.
"We have difficulty in getting the cuffs to remove," confirms the head of the Czech Ministry of Transport Jiří Klás, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klasa, there is a horrific law that binds officials.
First of all, the billboard owner has to talk complicatedly to put the ad away.
But the bosses of the company are often insatiable or they know the final, which was now in the past.cz described when the issue began to be more interesting: just a mobile stand with an ad shift by a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the basket.
That's because the Office needs to determine exactly where an illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagrees, he looks at it as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klasa.
The new law won't help.
The change could have brought new law, which will ban billboards at the highways from September next year and limit them to the first class roads.
The critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't get so good.
So companies can continue to earn tens of hundreds of millions of crowns per year on the leases of illegal areas and no one can.
For example, the billboard that comes to Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
Officials know her well: Czech-duch magic with her currently leads three administrative proceedings for a blackly built billboards.
Ferry is at risk of three hundred thousand fines in each procedure.
This is more advertising that has been placed without permission in the class I road protection zone.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of Transport of the Czech Republic Magistrate.
Advertising, which is now active.cz, although it is not yet working among these cases, will soon be brought to them soon.
According to the spokesperson of RSD Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and then the case will reach the regional table and then probably to the Magistrates.
Comerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that are unable to contact.
She doesn't accept mail and the official headquarters of Žižkov canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office was attended by Anton Fischer, a South Bohemian businessman who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Huundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents Comerz Billboard's area and offers it to advertisers, but in the past he refused any connection.
In the springtime, when the company started at the initiative News.cz interested in advertising at Lipno, Fischer had the public officials sent a letter for the secret company Commerz Billboard to his house, where the newly established company is supposed to be home.
Of course, no one has heard from this address from the highway administrators until today.
Bad fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not unusual.
One company several years ago, we gradually imposed fines for two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ICU, and there was nothing to solve.
The case was back, the commercials were still standing, maybe elsewhere.
We are powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, confessing to anonymity one of the officials.
The amendment to the law in this regard is not yet addressed.
Currently.cz spoke with several Members, who had taken the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the term for the conservation of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also regional and municipal policy, they are very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them because of the advertising in the electoral campaigns.
I don't stand the rather established impression that when things don't work, laws need to be changed.
Farmers clean up less grains this year, but more beet and poppy, estimate the statistics.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, cereals harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
This year, however, crops exceed the average in the last five and ten years.

This comes from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office, according to the status of July 15.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic a month ago and assumed a decimal drop against last year.
The cereal harvest last year was disproportionate.
This year's crops exceed the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, rape and poppy will be higher this year.
More than a year ago, the tips of the growers will harvest by 3.9 percent, when they got under the roof of 1.256 million tonnes.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to a reduction in the hectares yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a fall in the area of sowing.
Farmers donated by three percent less fields this year.
The cold wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be collected by 3.3 percent this year, according to estimates.
The farmers put her on more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed for decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
The 5th decline in the statistics is expected in the spring barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
A reduction of 15.2 per cent of the area is worth reducing crops, but even lower per hectare yields.
On the contrary, the winter barley is born by 6.3 percent more.
It will also increase the skin harvest.
The crop of rapes is estimated at 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The periphery area spread by 7.3 percent.
However, the yield of hectarum will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s crop exceeds a 10-year average of 13.3 percent, with a third of an area larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years there has also been fields with poppy.
This year, farmers sent him to 35.543 hectares.
In 2008, when poppy grew on record 70 000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it is half.
This year's poppy harvest will make the area richer.
Up against last year by 2.5 percent to 27 423 tonnes.
However, the yield of hectarum will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men with knife and machete attacks, sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a knife and a 40-year-old man on Tuesday in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by a partial and cut wound which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said the police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
Both the perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by the police.

The police have charged two police officers with assaulting a 25-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.

The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people who became on Tuesday on the right noon at the Freedom Class, the police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informing the Olomoouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
The massive struggle between the two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Tratorium bar in the immediate vicinity of the city center Olomouc.
After a aggressive word, two attackers were attacked using a knife and a man of twenty-five years old.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by a hemorrhaging and cut wound, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments, the police spokesmen said.
In a fight that built up a lot of attention in the city centre, and for which several police guards and guards must be involved on the spot, they were family disputes.
Criminals of a 40 - year - old man from Slovakia and a seven - year - old man from Olomouc charged with an attempt to severe harm and abuse.
The applicant has filed a motion for a court of custody, and he has complied with the court on Friday, supplementing the spokesperson.
The machetes used in the center of Olomouc during mass battle also five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters further, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrovo Street.
At that time, the police said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who stood outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with conditional punishment.
Empty and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You're gonna be surprised, maybe you're going around them every day.
One of the most excruciating examples of the unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senovana Square.
She was supposed to work like a hotel.
But it's still nothing.
That new apartments and offices need to be built in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected ones?
In the immediate vicinity of Václavské náměstí there are several active houses, which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection only empty and removes emptiness.
Real estates in the centre we have chosen using the empty house.cz project, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, transparent relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty houses in the Czech Republic are more than homeless.
Let the owners pay for them a special tax, he wants an initiative
They almost shot Fidel Castro here, and Hitler's brother lived here.

Shopping apocalypse.
The U.S. Trade Centers eat emptiness.

Last year, the Clintons earned $10.6 million.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton's ex-president, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars they gave Clinton to charity.
Most of the Clinton revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
A candidate of American Democrats at Hillary Clinton's presidential office released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent Donald Trumpa to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton's ex-president, made $10.6 million last year, announced an AP agency.
Most of the Clinton revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that the husbands of Clinton had a federal income tax of 34.2 per cent last year and then a tax on state and local income at nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of income on taxes.
However, Trump has had a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish a tax return.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secret around Trump's income, inter alia, in order to raise doubts whether her opponent is actually as rich as he claims to be, the AP has put forward.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower pay would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady today, published a report on his tax contributions in the last ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton gave 7.5 percent of their profits on charity and 25.6 percent on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the giants broke again.
The Islamics of Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccination and killed a physician.
In Nigeria, child armor cases were re-emergenced.
In the north-east of the country there, the government declared emergency vaccinations, because there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccinations were delivered by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented vaccination, and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there, the virus collided unnoticed.
In the northeastern Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of children against armor will begin because there were two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, the corn was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that millions of children will be vaccinated in the State of Born and another four million in the surrounding states.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday according to the AP quickly moved the vaccine against child armor into the affected North-East part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus in the area for many years collided unnoticed.
In the past, extremists from Boko Haram prevented vaccinations and even killed a doctor.
Their attacks also made Thursday impossible for doctors to enter areas where children with armor were detected.
Both affected backpacks came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for evaporating Michel Zaffran station BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Born, the Islamic radical group boko Haram has worked for a long time.
The area was made available to international organisations and government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram succeeded in this part of the country in an essential way to weaken.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of armor were a big disappointment for the country, because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that it had been evicted in it.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease did not show up for two years, it still spread between children.
Children under five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012 there were half of all cases of armor in Nigeria.
While the grain was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and North Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to fallen women's stories.
Pope František met with 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a group of pimps.
The Pope heard their hard life stories and asked them to look into the future with confidence.
Frantisek wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed by the police from the power of a band of shepherds.
More than an hour, the Catholic Church’s head listened to fallen women’s stories and then called on them to look to the future with confidence, to tell Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visitor Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him, said the Pope's spokesman.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people at the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he made an appointment with Syrian refugees who arrived in Vatican this year in April and in June due to his personal invitation.
France will hit the Jihadist products.
But it won't be possible without the help of Muslims.
In the fight against radical Islamism, France itself has the help of Muslims.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is committed to major changes in the functioning of the Mosque and spiritual education.
From last December we closed 20 Mosques and prayer.
And others will follow, announced the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims don't help states fight against those who distort public freedom, France will still be harder to guarantee this confession of freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imms who were educated in France preach in the Moshes and Prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of the Mosque from abroad.
Currently comes from abroad about 20 percent of the money to build new mossies, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is why preachers get into the Mosque, who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," said the Prime Minister.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to ensuring that he meets these goals.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation now operates for Islam, founded by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
The Foundation had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the Mosques and the countries which finance their construction.
But the institutions soon hit internal dissolutions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
In the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace the unfunctional foundation.
All of them speeded up other terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out in the name of the Islamic State by betraying Islamists.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that the new foundation will be created this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of the Mosque from home resources as well as to oversee the immunities.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mossies, but also to various educational centres.
A few suggestions are considered.
One is a special fee or tax on food halls.
In practice, the shopkeepers would pay for certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's money.
The contribution of 10 to 20 Euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year there are about 30,000 of traditional pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who went through special educational programs at French universities should act in the Mosques in the future.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
Let's close the radical mosques.
The French government is at the same time in the campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently the Home Secretary.
In France, there is no place for those in the Mosques who preach hatred and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country according to estimates, there are about 2500 Moshebens and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have fired about 80 imams, and in a few more decades they consider it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's steps can significantly interfere with radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
This is not the case in Mosques, young people radicalise on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Dragon Kelem lost in the first round of sprint with the Star Baugem.
The procedure up to the eighth final must be completed by the Czech track cyclist in repairing.
Dear cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic games in Riu de Janeiro following the procedure for the qualification of sprint among the best 18 he lost in the 1st round fighting with the French Velican Grigory Baugem, defenseman of silver from past games in London.
The procedure up to eight finals must be killed in repairing.
27 riders were built on the start of royal discipline on the track and the best Czech driver has now added his fourteen best time.
Two-star flight starter in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to be qualified by the fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kemen concluded that he had been in charge of an experienced Frenchman, but he took care of the procedure.
Great performance was the defenseman of Jason Kenny's gold.
The eight-year-old Brit ran the third fastest two hundred of history and won 9.551 in Olympic record.
It was easy then, as expected, to consult the last moving German Maximian Levy.
There was also a British quartet in a lineup with Bradley Wiggins, which took a new world record of 3:50,570 in the race for 4 km.
The existing maximum (3:51,659) which belonged to the British four years after the London Olympics improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Buttons: Want fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute for a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the full board to support further field actions from early September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to resolve the contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted against the contract agreed with BMA in July.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter published by JDC President Ellen McCourt last Thursday night on Twitter, the government stated that it remained “keep quiet” to questions, which was the big deal to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC Executive Authority decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to government silence today, the Executive Board of JDC formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of successful field actions from the beginning of September.
The dispute led by a young doctor this year to issue for six strikes, including the first general strike in the history of NHS.
The leader of the young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
BMA members at meetings before the vote 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for medicine in England.
Russia and Turkey: The "incomparable" society?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to pick up their hands and announce the formal termination of eight months of the long-term vocabulary and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish anti-party in the luxury hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
There's been a hand application, yes.
But Putin wasn't laughing, and she barely got warm, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” to Mr Putin, five times, as one of the reports said.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted like nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm made the opposite clear.
But the persistent cold emitted from Putin showed that the Russian leader forgot nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: shooting a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was angry at the time.
Putin was handing his wounds around him, and Ankar was accused of hitting a knife in the back of Moscow.
The deterioration was greater that she had lost a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real confidence will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media for months led a massive pan-wide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do it for everything.
More serious was the accusations of senior state officials on the fact that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this very much.
But in St Petersburg, the official message is that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
The benefits of the declaration of the truce are clear for Ankara.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost degenerate during a failed rifle last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have apparently been encircled as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a tough impact - especially the abolition of charter flights, which each year transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This figure decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia, tour operators and charter companies are concerned, they will still breathe here if the flights may be restored.
They make the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when it was re-imported agricultural commodities from Turkey.
"Turists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Guide News.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West as what he considers to be a greedy reaction to an attempt to convert.
In addition, the long-lasting impoverishment of long-term talks on entry into the EU and Putin's entry - which longs to be able to take advantage of the cooling and to break the ties of Turkey and the West.
The Russian leader was certainly given bonus points when Ankar asked him to help the elected authorities after they tried.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has deep rooted the fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pumping, the coastal palace of Russia and Turkey has enabled me to demonstrate what one analyst has described to me as "incompatible society": how they combine the forces of two countries that feel like they are rejected and used by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown reconciliation, there are major differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three-hour opening talks, both the presidents said at the press conference that they did not even mention this question.
The Turkish president deliberately answered the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to lift these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of an absolute disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian battle plane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be pushed to the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing itself to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the global ambitions of the bank.
She flew from them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, the loss marks used the "RBS" to protect the other brands of consumer finances.
It was worth millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations to the Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to make it more unique to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it will not trigger new stores.
All references to the RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the headquarters and the encoding of shares on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other smaller brands for private banking, which will get more into the front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trip to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered the questions of Ross McEwan.
Stanici BBC Scotsko said: “The RBS will no longer be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work because we are now becoming a bank of brands much more. ”
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand and a RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to focus on our home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something very different in its own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, prepared the profile of individual sports sponsors.
“There was a good time for us to move to the bank sign, because the basic question (which we ask) is how do we focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we were going to be a great customer bank, and we introduced those marks.
But with the way we focused on customers' needs, not on our own, I think there are many changes.
We can remind these marks of boredom, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horseback Predilecation led to the goal of 3000.
Dettori's tearing up champagne after his double victory in Newmarket brought 3,000 victories.
Frankie Dettiori's wife made 3000 of a victory in the Newmarket in Britain on Friday.
This milestone achieved its second victory on its local track - on the horse Predilecation, which John Gosden is training.
The five-year-old Italian is a sixth-year-old boy who has achieved this in plane racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold champion of the Dettori harvest, who previously won the Ghayyar horse, said, “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I'm extremely glad this happened in Newmarket because I just stuck it here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulation when, after the victory, Predition brings
Two pupils of this milestone reached obstacles – the Richard Johnson pupil champion and the 20-time champion on the pension Sir Anthony McCoy, which led the breaking records to the goal of over 4 300 winners during his career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best goons of modern times, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
It's stylish and powerful, but it's just his tactical phystrón that makes him different from the other riders in the respect.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Essoma that if he hadn't only been on weekends and big races, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie drove a winner in the UK for a greater part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
She has a living character, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, she's an incredible noodle.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishes to summer jumps - Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British plain races two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
The vast number of big race winners, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot, survived, but also survived the plane crash and had a ban on starting for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated when he returned after a six-month ban on start, but he showed incredible inner strength and all the doubters in spite of his return in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has said earlier that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released Chairman of the President's office, Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivan's office from the post of Presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of the closest Putin co-workers for many years.
A three-year-old Ivanov was appointed a Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
Kremlin's statement states that Putin “wrote Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian President's office,” but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been the representative of Ivanov since 2012.
Fourty-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokji.
On the website (in Russian) it is noted that later he was the Head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in terms of the draft laws and control of how much your instructions are respected.
Putin said on Friday the Russian television station that Ivanov asked him to release from the post and recommended that he replace it just Vajno.
Will he convince smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergej Ivanov was on the ground for one of Vladimir Putin's closest co-workers and as Putin worked for KGB.
As Head of the Presidential Office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who sent off the state television, both men said that the President's office was leaving for its own request.
But smiles on the camera convinced few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary choices.
Is this the consequence of a struggle for power?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man who once considered himself as a possible president is suddenly eager to lead the environmental policy of Russia has met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin site, notes addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012, I asked you in an interview to give me this very demanding post, even to say problematic post, to believe for four years.
As it seems, I've been the president's chief of the office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took a post office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Vice-President of the government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and earlier, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, while Putin was the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), replaced by KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
He even speculated his time that Ivanov might be the successor to Putin in charge of the state after his second term of office, because the third period for Putin would be contrary.
But this post took over another nearby Putin's co-workers, Dmitry Medvev.
Putin, before returning to the presidential office, became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the criminal mind show, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television station ABC and CBS, which the series produce, reported in the joint declaration of release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner on Thursday, apologized to his execution.
There have been creative differences in the scene and I am not agreeing.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in the statement.
According to television stations ABC and CBS, details of the way that Gibson's character disappears from a series that follows the stories of the FBI's team, a little later.
The four-year-old actor, famous for the main role in the sitcom of Dharma and Greg, has been active in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of a criminal, and in the last twelve years I have given them both the heart and the soul," Gibson said in his statement, which he gave on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it till the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and above all to the great fans in which this show could ever hope.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on 28 September.
In Banff mysteriously landed in a garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eel that left the stink there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his finding in the sense that someone could help explain how some five-centimeter fish on his garden got there.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with the Fife
The project for £ 1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with the Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the “wiers of the platform” which are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The project for £ 1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
The Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project we are all aware of how construction engineers have used over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge in an impressive way.
Despite the massive dimensions and mass of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform bridge of the delicate operation required exceptional accuracy.
In its place is now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last parts of the platform is now in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Construction Project, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this cap represents the tip of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
This is what we did by stretching the north approach viaduct of 700 millimetres in the south direction.
This was a massive, very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is a long 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to stretch about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimetres each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are happy to be alive
Three men are happy to be alive after the water from their fishing ship near England.
The Moelfree RNLI rescue boats reported an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw a incident in the Gulf of Moelfree.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unreservedly.
“We saw how their boat was going near them, and we thought the worst thing,” said the lifeboat Moelfree Vince Jones.
"The strong wind has, fortunately, driven him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing vessel, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life-saving vest exhausted by holding a fight.
They were all transferred to the coastal lifeboat deck and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Your men are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency off, but somehow there was a separation from the person who was driving the boat when there was a breach.
Someone's holding their guard hand from above these guys.
The judge refuses to solve a case for Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the prosecution, should have received from Prime Minister Nečas and his then bosses of the chamber of Jana Nagya political pok, i.e. a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012 it was about the approval of the tax package.
Snajdr, Fuksa and Tluchor enabled him with their resignations.
Then they showed up on powerful posts in state firms.
Therefore, they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, almost 2 million crowns of compensation werempacted.
The deafman now appears in bail as a witness after the High Court's intervention.
His wife works in the Fruit Market Court building and solves civilian disputes.
Yet, he wants to be Judge Helena the King's guardian (directed criminal matters - see red.) and prevent possible objections.
The case seems to have been given to another Prague jurisdiction.
The king has already doubled Jan Nečas’s guilt before Nagy.
It was the alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, the Tluchor wasn't working.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be interpreted as to exclude the court if witnesses have a wife or relative in court.
I'm afraid there would be no judgment at all, not a note for a diary.
"I feel like it's streety," he added.
Roman Bocek, former official, is also charged with a political hit.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, any objection might have had a chance to succeed.
On June 13, the District Court of Prague discussed the prosecution of the former chiefs of the headquarters of Prime Minister Petra Nečas Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and others accused in bail of abuse of Military Intelligence.
Time and husband come to court.
The deafman was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutk.
For example, the wife of the Emissary was to judge President Milosz Zeman's statements on the democratic prewar journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently perished in the air raid of allied forces.
She and her two same old girlfriends left last February at the Gatwick London airport.
The British Ministry of Interior did not comment on her death.
The young London girls who escaped from home were secretly transferred to Syria via Turkish border, according to the police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultan were headed by the media for their next former classmate from London's Betnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between the UK and Turkey.
The British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims have been travelling to Syria so far, about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Great paid work you don't even need for college.
So he looks like he's got a first-hand job look.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on Czech terms extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180 000 in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason for this is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted are according to the Agency's statistics, Grafton developers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates may choose between several offers of work.
Therefore, they do not match the job candidates, but the job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't a necessity.
High school education is not a necessity for Americans.
University education means a good basis and is a comprehensive indicator of intelligence and education of the candidate, but does not often have the power to share with knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which once a educated college does not replace, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
Most of them are made in Prague.
The crew's wages are moving all over the Republic average.
They come to the most money in Prague and Brno, and it is no longer such a hitparade in the regions.
"The working conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," confirms Kubačka.
At the highest salary, tech-engineer's directors will reach them.
In Prague and Brno they can come to CZK 120 000 - 180 000.
In other regions, pay is lower, but not less than CZK 80,000.
Requests are also IT project managers.
When entering, they can make 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
Fight them for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go directly to the office of work, it doesn't apply to the A.A.
As long as companies slide and re-schedule an expert from another company, they like to reach out to graduate.
They can raise him according to their own.
They can't go without their tongues.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable for every profession, but at least a decent English is necessary.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet many cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
If, for example, an aid worker controls more foreign words, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds the director of Cuba.
Yeah, Google, there's paradise.
Only quiet envy can be the Czech workers of Google.
Of course, there is a flexible working time for them, a possibility of working from home or a variety of short-time jobs, not only for moms.
"The company provides four weeks of vacation after the birth of the child," says Martin Joneková, spokesperson of Google.
Harvesting includes health care for employees and families, catering, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Whoever wants to study, has a green light, and doesn't care what a new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end with benefits.
Such a full refrigerator is also certainly not possible.
Healthy lunch (in some localities and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in every office where people always find a healthy snack, revealing speakers.
And in order for nothing to throw away, so as long as it doesn't eat, he's gonna put in a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on Czech terms is for incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," said the spokesperson.
The UN warmly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights of criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "has raised serious concern about Bulgaria’s failure to comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and powerful public figures express their public support for criminal armed combats, which are taking place on refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically arrested," said Zeid.
What's even worse - they are often punished and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criticised despite everyone having the right to leave any country under international law, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14 000 migrants this year, for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - the hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people over the last decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of their screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from the sofa and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screen was originally stinking on TV, later on video games and mostly on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and outside activities don't rule out.
I am talking of course about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that appeared for the first time in video games at the end of the 1990s (unless, there was a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was also a decrease in interest in this new game before the start of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The inclusion in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of the servers.
Pokémon Go acquired more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, smart-phone players go out looking for Pokémons that follow GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo them" (over screenshot on the phone) or "take".
Mania has captured the generation, which at the younger age of the game played, picks her up from the seats and marries out looking for Pokemons.
In the United States, this game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that people will do every day.
The Cardiogram application for a smart watch from Appl, which follows 35,000 users, recently for Washington Post, said that in two days after the start of the game, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - only sees gross data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to "find 30" people, "come up from the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on unnatural land, because most of the messages on public health are boring and targeted people who do not look good.
Yet, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot complete here.
But the beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some people will even get new friends in pursuit of the dark.
As it already is, of course, there are these boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk into the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At their time, applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to follow our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this at this game.
The news will look around and the interest in her will begin to fall at some point.
However, thanks to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help many people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles got gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Dynamite to the crossover.
Without force on the hammer.
They were all phony during the simplest.
Excellent in everything.
And now it's the Olympic Championship.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight through the title in multiples on Thursday, and the others overcame the full line under the Olympic headlamps.
The overall result was 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead in front of a silver medalist and a member of the "final five" team, Aly Raisman, and Russian medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the piano performance in the finals of several individuals in sports gymnastics at summer Olympic Games 2016 in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles has become the fourth American in a row that won the multi-fight, and the fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnastics of her generation and perhaps the best at all.
When her overall final evaluation on the board and her long journey until this moment was over, she appeared on her face tears.
This success amongst the same leagues of unique athletes of its time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Bilesová's last three years of sports dominates, won 15 medals on the world champions, including 10 golds. Her wonderful compositions are a mixture of ambitions and accuracy and Olympic champion in 1984, Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast who she's ever seen."
The final test was waiting for her in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than going home to his Spring family in Texas with the hands of a full of gold medals would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are interested in winning the gold and silver medals in the final of female multitasking at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in the Brazilian Riu de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was like an eviction at a party leaving the national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her compositions in simple - the one that contains a typical triple salto with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just fit home to the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted her grandparents like the batole and her talent discovered the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman was training and where he gained strength.
The contest has not been lost since the summer of 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took over her short lead thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Kladine and simple - where Biles defends the world championship - they are waiting.
She got back to her forehead with 15.433 points behind the beam - and closed with 15.933 points in simple.
Raisman hugged her gently when she was waiting for the final score - just a formality - and around the sparkle red, white and blue shadows appeared tears when the Biles had fulfilled the wish that once as a little wrote into the diary.
The power of Raisman was a bit of a reward for the Olympics four years ago, when she was divided by the third yarn with Mustafin, then the bronze was due to the sum of the three best formations.
This time, the 20-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "babcha" was way ahead of you.
After her simple kisses she sent to the crowd, capable of returning, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, he has a contribution that this 19-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to the music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women died and a girl at the age of 12 during the most severe attack of the decade in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot when they sat in the car talking and listening to music.
The authorities have announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots of the gun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth three times the robbery, because the attacker didn't take his wallet or a $2,900 amount that one of the adult victims had.
Phoenix spokesperson, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that investigators were trying to find out if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic quarters, there were nine attacks in a total of four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It is happening in the villa quarter before the houses," said Howard earlier this month for the branch of KPHO station CBS.
The police believe the suspect has been using several cars, including brown Nissan from the late 1990s, black BMW from the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and executed by the same killer.
(33) Ellis was transferred to the hospital, where she later fell by her injury.
Liner (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on the scene.
A witness told the police that it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which turned out to be an empty supply only half an hour before a three-fold murder, and the police believe that her producer was this serial killer.
The investigators found shells and the rest of the bullet in the seat and made a bullet from under the hood of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old with a microceflia: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Piccíto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys, and, of course, also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, which is the consequence of genetic disorders his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during her pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I thought I'd never make it.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this today," explains Picciut.
Edmund's going out with a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit down and cry, and he still doesn't talk.
But some of them are already slowly filling.
He goes with the help and rides his bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows her sign language, using which Edmund says, "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language", said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - he says that Edmund has some characters made up himself.
Microcephalia can arise from a number of different states: genetics, such as the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as incinerators or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasting may differ substantially.
It's too soon to say what the effect Zika virus will have on the infected lives.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax that he chooses the uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What will happen next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
But Picciutová has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from the birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rain and floods requested rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana made the governor declare an emergency condition on Friday. Further rains are expected on Saturday.
National meteorological service (NWS) has reported that after extreme liyas, a number of rivers in the southeastern Louisiana and the Southern Mississippi will pour out of their shores and threaten large floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and the aid is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, Governor's spokesperson for national security and emergency preparedness said that they were receiving applications for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only the Tangipaho district asked for ten thousand sand bags.
The flood patrols will remain in most of South Louisiana for Saturday.
The weather service in the statement said that another about 8 to 13 cents can rain on the sea.
In southern Alabama there was a flood patrol in an emergency on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile City.
According to predictions, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to be gloating on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood many houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are flooding in Ascension district, when these divorcing flows will only be found slowly in the Lake Maurepas.
Tickfaw, a little south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9am of local time.
Savers are still picking people up from avalanche in the county of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step son were already on Friday between the saved at Gloster's.
Hansford (22) said that water from Beaver Creek, which are normally more than 120 metres from his house, has increased quickly overnight.
He said his other stepfather, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up and the water came near," said Hansford.
We had her in the waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge trucks in military style and took them to the Gloster firehouse, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that, with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods “quietly spread” and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston announced that between midnight and Friday morning 35 centimeters of rainfall.
Krautmann said that the soil has been soaked from the middle.
The authorities said that the heavy rain and the roads paid have requested the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipaho district and the abolition of education in five school districts.
The branch office of WWL station CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipahoa.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which are both but now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that high water stuck.
In the village of Amite and in Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to go home when the water starts to burn," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipaho district in Hammond, and locals got sandbags available that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“The last major floods were here in March,” said the administrator of Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager at Harrison County, Mississippi, said that a lasting rain continues on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said Thursday, a few houses were reported sinking, but on Friday, none of them showed up on the report.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods, Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water in several places where I had never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Majaja Brown (6) - "A man shot like a man," survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia.
The parents of the child identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
“He took that very much, his little body was shot as it was done,” said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy's in critical condition at the hospital, and he's done several surgeries.
The station family said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to go to the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two of them aged 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stable condition.
According to the report of the station, the child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
CBS Philadelphia's investigators said that there was probably a gunfight between several armed men.
On the scene were found shells of a type of attack weapon belonging to various weapons of attack.
Apparently, it was definitely about a continuing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants, who were actively involved," said the captain of the Philadelphia Police, Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and vehicles were also planted in the area.
Nobody's been arrested, and the police are supposed to investigate video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in her arms by a stray shot on Tuesdays in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl recovers, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is how I imagine a female team of gymnastics for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US have never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnastics in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team that complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocin.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black and Latin American at the top of this sport.
A gymnastic number one in the past four years was African-American.
Simon and Gabby were on the first and second run last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals became a champion of Olympic games and America was exhilarating.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world winners of Simon Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but mastery gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in women's multi-study individuals.
And Aly Raisman's team member got silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but in class of gymnastics in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the team of gymnastics at the next Olympic game will be composed only of four athletes, and this is the last year that Martha Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, roads, tracks, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trustees and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnastics have all the training and family gymnastics and gymnasts are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at a time when they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring trainings to gymnastics, which are more accessible and accessible communities, the countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I started a gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people within the city (mainly black and Latin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my native city) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and work.
Just inspiration from this team will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for proving your "kids of power" and you won Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivated so many young girls of all origins to go on the way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be no consensus on changes. But 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part in the election refused the contract.
Hunt in July discovered plans to enforce the contract with NHS being in "no one" and further delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Doctor Ellen McCourt, BMA Vice-President for Young Doctors said last night: “You young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and that is, fair treatment for all physicians."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enter into a new contract, progress is needed and time is running.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the reluctance to involve Dr. and often with the deafening silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise from last month, that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, press on forcedness and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this doesn't happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits occurred because sisters and specialists were called to join doctors who were among protestors.
Ministers hoped that, after the conclusion of the revised agreement, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude the non-conformities concerning changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on a weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be subject to contract.
Daniel Mortimer, President of the employers' NHS, called on a young doctor not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “The field action will reach only a few or nothing, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services, and they will increase fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, staff and their families. ”
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informer.
Employees hoped that the continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as exploitation, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after the career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, studies and pay gap between sex - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Treatment for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that is around 60 crowns (two pounds) in the conversion.
Ticagrelor blood control reduces the risk of a seizure in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS Watchdog NICI recommends that the medicine is administered to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS Watchdog NICI recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, a heart attack or stroke will suffer about 140,000 people each year and a quarter of them will be affected by another stroke or stroke.
Hearts and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat that creates a corresponding layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is removed, blood clots may develop, blocking blood access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue to block the blood supply into the brain and cause a brain stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which produces the British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of clots becoming less likely.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NYCE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor is shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to see that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - beyond the three years is limited, it is not recommended in the draft treatment over this time.
Computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
The mayor of the city Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was withdrawn from office for corruption last year, which was linked to a government report
The political culture of honesty has led to the overseeing of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, is now in a government report.
The Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, electoral inspectors, and city councillors for ignoring the abuse of voters because of "excessive ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should do cordones and fearless voters to protect them from the election rooms.
He recommended that the voters take with them an I.D. and can prove who they are during the elections.
Now, the voters need to state their name and address.
In the report, it is also proposed to put an indelible ink on the fingers of the people when handing over the vote to avoid someone voting twice.
Whistlers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to have more access to documents from the meeting and decisions that accept non-official committees or the work of the group.
"It is not only protection against electoral fraud, it is also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from his post after having charged with corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman “cyanically affected” the religious creed of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “he has put his campaign to be a religious duty for Muslims to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned, or as a result of stealing an identity, when a person votes and issues himself someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about fraud in the correspondence vote - which is claimed to be the older members of the Muslim community during it to put pressure on people to vote for the candidates that they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including the presentation of a document of identity
His report states: “There was evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were put up with pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There were concerns that... the state institutions came to face such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origins and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including to prevent political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and to prevent "reduction of votes".
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also calls for more thorough checks on registers to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking the voters to present evidence of identity prior to the vote.
Using the indelible ink to the fingers of the people when voting to avoid someone voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence vote to limit for a period of three years.
ban political agitators and activists from manipulating the correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a cordon election room around.
Change laws to be easier to prosecute people developing illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Law.
Disable taking photos in the electoral rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the electoral rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that no criminal charges have been raised after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The vote for the election was suspended by Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
For many reasons he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of crime.
It also criticises the consistent “checking cheeks” in the department for registration of voters in the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “The judgment of the last year in the Tower Hamlets case is awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but worrying and secret dissemination of electoral fraud and the state of rejection of certain authorities threaten this reputation.
Retirement of the cyclical double Duchess Kate and other pair of famous personalities at the Riu Olympics
Fans of the Olympic Games in Riu 2016 went crazy this week to French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Preevote, which is quite similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 40 - year - old Olympics isn't far from being the only athlete of gold this year, which can boast its own twin from amongst known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and of all the famous personalities that currently appear on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics who are more than a distantly similar Hollywood celebrity.
As a hunted animal: a member of the U.S. archer team of Brady Ellis (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCapri since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s biking course, a number of online people quickly pointed out that a archer could be the twinger of the star Leonard DiCapria.
The racer from a team of U.S. archers, Brady Ellis, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures, clearly like the wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had been hearing about his similarity with Leo since he was a little girl.
"He sees no similarity himself, except beards," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"He's a loser and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: a clear image between the British jumper to Greg Rutherford's distance and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin, with her big, remarkable eyes, has been said to be a copy of Gloria Estefan-American singer.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison's star for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is a "athletic version" of an actor from the movie Start (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis stars of Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyes and lips.
The Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same snow and blond hair that Annalynne McCord has. And Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, the fans say that he looks like a “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitta.”
Decter Jennifer Carpenter (right) is similar to the shape of the face and eyes.
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that the others noticed similarities
In waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple's similar appearance
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that “the rest of the Internet think Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
The Hope Sol football star and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter's actress are really incredibly similar to the shape of the face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of Laura Linney's actress, or the gold medal holder for the gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of his beautiful wide smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC’s Olympic Games apologize for the Chinese swimmer saying that she “sucked out”
The viewers of the midfield live live transmission from the Olympic Games to the CBC started the analysis of the performance of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald.
The CBC station was forced to apologize for what one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old swimmer during the race "taught like a smell" and "suck out".
The Byron MacDonald commentator thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the finale of the woman's grade on 4x200 meters free style began to protect his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CCC's commentator team, said: "The little fourteen-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, stretching like a smell, blowing up.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second race in 1:57.79 - that is, 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Chinese to catch up.
The viewers in Canada started to call themselves online quickly and were scared of tone and language that commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the publisher report to the CBC that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “slow"?
That idiot didn't notice he's still on the broadcast."
Ai Yanhan from China in the female chauffeur finale at 4x200 metres free-style was described as: “The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
The critic Byron MacDonald came on Twitter from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they did not stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon afterwards, Scott Russel, who was hosting the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: “We apologize for the commentary on the swimmer who escaped to the broadcast. ”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC station finally apologized to more than 90 times the people who tweeted in response to the comments
Scott Russel's roommate had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and added their apology to an answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She's sincerely sorry that the words were spoken out, she wasn't supposed to get into the ether.
We quickly apologize to our audiences on the air and those who are watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer himself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying that he didn't want her to sound like a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize for the comment I mentioned last night after the woman's team," said he on the broadcast from the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer, not a person who was a swimmer."
"There is no need to say that I had no disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in the first place upset a woman who has been unsatisfyingly trying her underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman took her clothes off to try her panties on the sales platform in the middle of the first place, they weren't buying any security to watch.
To make it even worse, she tried to get her size off, her panties undressed and put them back in the shelf.
In view she continued and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place shopping center.
Shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried panties before she returned them to the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the shop at that time, said that a mysterious woman was “dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "The people couldn't believe in their own eyes."
She was standing in the middle of the store, took the panties off the shelf, undressed her own punks and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place, just standing there, standing like a monkey."
"Everyone only stared at the way she undressed her panties, and obviously she didn't like them because she returned them back to the shelf."
She did the same thing with three more than finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She seemed to be okay with who was watching, not thinking about the guy who might buy the panties she had tried."
Ms. Davidson (33) who lives in Kent said: “The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else has wearing and nobody has cleaned them.
There was an event on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things she obviously tried to pull them off the sale - which is also the only right thing. ”
"I'd think I'd bring new panties home and find out that there was another woman wearing them, take them off, and they weren't washed up."
The spokesman of Prinmark said: “He knows about the incident that occurred at our Folkstone store on Tuesday, August 9th. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend yourself against a weapon attack by Krav Maga
The world is dangerous outside, but thanks to this Dailymail.com video, it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over a superstition rapist, whether they approach you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from behind, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have free track of missiles".
Then you will understand the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you throw it in the face with a free elbow.
Then you follow the knee to the weakness, and while the attacker is in pain, you cut the gun out of his hand, hit it in the main face, and you start to retreat, while you hold the gun pointing on it.
If the armed man comes near you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fireline, grab the gun and twist it so the darbist can't shoot.
At the same time, put your strength in the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his reversing and start retreating, keep cutting it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of the ambush - if you're not the master of Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright has been working on Europe's most dirty places for travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a dazzling reflex - by lying down the most pulsive and prettiest places in Europe.
The moderator and author of Ian Wright's travels (51), originating in Suffolk, covered the strength of his immune system with his language with euro banknotes, rails on Piccadilly Circus, a button of flush on the train toilet and a Russian public telephone.
Before deciphering each subject, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he's getting into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the button of the flusher on the train, which used thousands of other people, may seem totally repugnant, but in fact, in the kitchen sink, it is much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke with doctors and specialists throughout his journey to Europe about the strengthening of gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that licked his mouth left him any worse than the smell.
Ian Wright famous himself to test the resistance of his intestines around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he completely tested his immune system - from public railing to train stations
In the film that he made about it, he says: “I have not taken much care of my health since I was a child, and I have put everything possible in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and mud water. ”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
All he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
After a simple removal of the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public bathroom in Russia but licked after having shown his luminometer more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish milk product manufacturer Valio filmed a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
He said in the movie, "This is almost the most exhilarating thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
No more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna do anything 'cause it's disgusting here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish milk product manufacturer Valio.
Mr. Wright provided the product to Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, which help people strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the capture and allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of only talking about products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, directed by the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something of what I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie.”
The licking of some things was for Ian naturally easier, others pretty hard again.
I'm glad we shot some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 according to which 84 percent of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria mainly with stomach and intestine health and 58 percent of the respondents indicated that at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family socially needed before eviction destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
The socially needed family left a damage of £50,000 on its home after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, housing cooperative officials were shocked when they found out the property was located in an emergency state.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, all over the floor with rollers of garbage and walls were bleaked.
The family has already moved away and is deemed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing said she was worried about going to save the house.
She said: “For people here it was a nightmare and I don’t think that people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is likely to come into consciousness as "not so nice part of Cornwall."
The family is unfamiliar and their names are unfamiliar.
A couple have three sons who sometimes lived in the house, and the police said that the horror of the family's work belonged to street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding people, drug use, distribution of drugs and loud shouting, fights and fraud.
The Skeldons (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, were punished in June for antisocial conduct.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, we have been found smelling trash.
In the house from where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
The neighbors say they've seen them on the street and they've been calling the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they received an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, which were relieved, welcomed the eviction that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, “They never cared for anyone at all.”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, you can't count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisory manager in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
Family in the house was 20 years old, a police officer was regularly invited to the house
Waste and old toys fell in a growing part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant could not take responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior. Exclusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who have been bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time will bear the message that we will not tolerate uncooperative behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of tenants who lived in a house in different times were about 20 years old.
Depleted mattress, which after eviction remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house.
In 2014, she performed the shelf in the house once and found over 70 grams of hemp, weights, equipment, and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of class B drug possession that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner after eviction are thought to live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
The police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease contracts
Angela Crow of Denov and Cornwall police said that eviction was a message sent to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave unpunished, and to those who wish to follow such behavior,” she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners in the protection of our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were scared after a low crossover of a military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed sunlight in the Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
Portuguese military air force plane P-3C Orion had flown to incredibly low
Military Air Force stated that it was a training flight, and it insisted that there was no threat to safety.
The moment a low-fly jet lifted over a crowded beach, there was a panic - scared tourist.
On dramatic shots, you can see how the military plane gets within the distance of the touch from the sunny people on the sandy beach of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists started to get up after the noise of the jet engines upset them without seeing what came out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several recreationalists who published the video recordings of the dramatic crossing on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse.”
Nun Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists at the beach in Aveir were scared when the plane was low from darkness
Portugal's military air force today stated that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing vessel off the coast and had to stand low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane was reported to fly a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, lettvo insists that human safety was not at risk.
Forest fires destroyed part of Estonian Portugal this summer and requested four lives on Madeira.
Portugal's military air force today stated that the pilot had to fly low because of dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during training.
Half of the burial services are not subject to regulations.
Half of the providers of burial services do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found that during the second quarter of checks.
In her view, the funeral services most often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not give written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The Czech Republic imposed 41 fines in total of CZK 77,000.
Today, her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed her.
The inspectors found doubts at 47 out of 95.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, certain burial services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold have not been duly labelled and once the seller has used officially uncertainted measuring instruments.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It was a fold of cases, candles cover and vases that were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"As in this specific area of services there is still a breach of the law, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolmen who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
A lawyer named Tasnime Akunje said that her family found out about her death in the Syrian Cancer a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Cancer, which is the bast of a group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just the moment she was preparing to escape from the war-freed country and to return to Britain.
“The man wants to believe that he is the only good person on this whole thing - like a message and warning for others, that this is a real danger associated with the way to the war zone - is that he will betray people from making decisions,” Akunia said.
Sultan and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London entered the plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan family learned that she married an IS warrior in Syria and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton's elected, he'll leave Garland as a candidate of the Supreme Court.
The senator for the democratic party Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate for the presidential elections for the Democrats Hillary Clinton is nominate judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his choice.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama had already nominated him in March.
The senator of the majority of Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late Supreme Court will elect a future president.
Reid stated during his conference call on Thursday that he believed Clinton would select Garland with a certain degree of credibility.
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he wasn't directly talking to Clinton about whether Garland was no match and that he was merely speculating.
He valued Garland and said that the Clinton team would choose someone else who didn't want to "throw the ship."
Garland is the chairman of a federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are the "servicers" and "offside" of a Republican candidate for Donald Trumpa's presidential office.
He said Trump wasn't good at the office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "womans also for men"
The Treats Magazine cooperates closely with photographer David Bellemer for the issue of the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of exposed known beings, NU Muses tries to find another generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw has told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness is different from Playboy's old school because "Playboy is a man."
I do it for women.
Clearly, the calendar believes so.
“We have to go back to displaying timeless and classic nakedness, when both women and men feel comfortable and get inspired by the photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in the press release declaration to issue the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
The models can send their pictures online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl loves being alone with middle-aged men.
Before you choose the comment section to shake with pebbly notes under the pseudonym NoAlliOsmousmousmsIIn the MiddleTerritory, we point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the resurrection of turntables is linked not to the boom of lovers who want to love the originality of physical property, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are least likely.
It's not really the accumulation of a excited fan - it's all emotional: the elderly people who buy turntables, probably want to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%) and are happy alone (69%) versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television news report, I would be followed by a camera as I go to the busy street in Soho, dressed in a decentred grey suit and swaying a wide range of gestures. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritative like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at this.
While Soho's heart slowly runs out of his charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent sellers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confederations and office needs - several fantastic specialized record stores have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), the native of Glasgow, who I followed from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London afternoon and is looking at shops to fill out several hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All these recordings were framed by the walls of his living room - in the picture above (I sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow it all the way home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because he can afford it: he can now buy turntables that he couldn't afford when they came out originally, and he buys back what he sold in his youth and didn't even have a winch.
“It’s very much what I buy from the end of the 1960 ’ s and from the early 1970’s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small and could not get them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like society to themselves, adding: “I do not smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Call (25) She works at Sister Ray, and she also thinks that a number of customers she's meeting fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed the new inflow of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people used to remove their collections most frequently between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought a CD, now sell their CDs to buy their turntables back," he says.
That could explain the boom of turnophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of turntables?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonnica that you can find a pleasant community of people with a similar minding in music stores.
According to the Board, some older customers are particularly upset by the system of unconnected payments.
In the digital world, some turntable fans of turntables may feel quenched and choose to make the familiar environment of turntables of turntables, things that cause memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think that filling a gap or doing something that is important can bring some comfort," says Call.
I'm the collector myself, it's like that with me, and I think there are a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in the head.
“We are all like their social workers” is called a co-workers from a bunch of turntables.
In April, the ICM survey revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of questionable turntables, which never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have turntables.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed really concerned about going through the piles of compilatory boss nova.
The aspect of "trophies" and recovery of interest is something that Jonny noticed (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy on the Radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of these is not large, but it happens.
It's more about a product page than music.
People who say, "I don't have a turnip."
They're younger people, not the older ones, and the teenagers who get into it.
Focus, where almost all of the floor is reserved for turntables, has many more diverse visitors in my arrival.
There are a couple of 70s, tourists doing photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not so relaxed, such as shops earlier - the speaker instead of the speedy jazz calls for the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see various customers.
None of them seem particularly alone, but it's hard to estimate when you're next to someone 30 seconds.
Elanara (27) is a few minutes’ walk through the Fopp and looks at various turntables in the discount.
She's one of those who's more of a look at the window than she's going to make a hot run.
According to his words, he doesn't make much money, so it doesn't seem like a turntable to collect record.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But record turntables have their magic... ," he'll breathe in a longing.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that allegedly inspired a new generation of turnophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm afraid I'm very impressed by the girls in the big jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just looking around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and his daughter are deciding to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left there is a stairway, which covers the wall of the turntables of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the foundation of any average collection of turntables.
No one looks at them - maybe it's because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money to the sector and send several customers to Soho's depths for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic area where there is probably more time and money than in other areas is also the one where it is most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl definitely is.
But while according to my findings, YouGov's results seem to be accurate - that is, at least in record stores, they don't take into account a lot of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
I'm sure he's not spending the Thursday morning wandering around the record store on Berwick Street, walking through recordings and avoiding a look at a strange, 30-year-old fake television moderator hiding behind the back of the unconscious middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - videoreportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that recording shows females whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five metres
The Court of France has refused to break down the business in the refugee camp of Jjungle
In France, the Court of Justice rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jjungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's trial, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 pro-vision shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer cutting hair, sell tea at pro-vision restaurants for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Calais argued that places had to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they mean the danger of fire and health risks.
The humanitarian organisations in the court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food, which offers a state-supported association and other groups, does not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees at camp.
Great prospective shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary shops, but stated that the objections of the Calais prefect were "excellent".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than simply giving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the demolice was the coffee shop in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which operates a non-profit organization, offering 200 meals, English hours and asylum advice for hundreds of threatened minors without accompaniment at camp daily.
More than 170 000 people have been signed by Petici for the protection of the “child” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that it would be a disaster for these children to close the cafe, some of which are only 8 years old."
The Charitative Organizations of Help Refuges and L'Aumberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the years has increased to more than 9 000 - which has been the most often possible.
He thought he was dead.
Crying yourself and the Volleyball Creatures.
"From March I was able to practice normally," reported to launch summer preparations in full force.
What were you doing?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and it's because of the heart problems.
Because when I was in Korea University, I didn't know I had any problems with blood.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
Two years, I had a clot in a cranium, and I didn't know it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the clot came up.
There's a wrecked vein in the velvet, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's manipulating or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I should have.
Last year at the wooden summer tournament, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was out for five more days.
I really thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I've had to go through it, and now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood issues, I have to watch myself more when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to get back into preparation for Pribrami last year, there were still problems with my heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have consistently prepared myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm physically better off than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the crew looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners coming.
Let's just sit back and sit together and let's get this together.
Can you lift up Ústí?
It had a reputation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now it ended second.
There's a new team in Ústí, there's only a few players left.
It was last in extralise, so there's a lot of room to improve.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see on the first round who's gonna be beat up, we don't think so.
Is it a guarantee of success Coach Brom?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot of things, he'll think of better than the last place.
But I didn't deal with his coming. I made a deal sooner.
There were other trainers in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed that he'd work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I am glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training a lot of decades, he's been a good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to be hectic, and I like to get an opportunity on not such a top team.
I've been in Příbrami for two years, but it's a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts with the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already trained Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And we used to have fun together a couple times, and sometimes we sat down after the games, so we know each other as well.
We beat them 3-1 right away at the start of summer preparations in Ústí.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I was texting with an American, looks like a good boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recording player, so I should communicate with everyone.
I found out what the player is, I found on the internet, how he plays, I saw some videos.
He was having quite a good time, boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, seemed like a joker, he's gonna fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of recording One?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'll be 40 and I don't have the nature to do it.
I'd rather be downtown, I'd rather be in charge of the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I was to be like a second recording player and spend it on full time, and if something doesn't work out, it sucks.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in Příbrami, when it didn't go to Kust as a captain, he hurt himself, then there were problems with the money, and he left.
Since then, we've been up there, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whom I was raised, I used to take one and two.
A great year was in Old Town, after him I had a lot of offers, and he chose the Příbram.
From there, they wanted me, Budejovice, and I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
A short position remains a Phelps domain.
"Be again at the stage winners and hear the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed while he had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother were back in the auditorium, the son Boomer slept peacefully with headphones on his ears this time.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started to swim well, and in a few hours it's over, he said milk.
In the finale for Phelps for almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's world championship.
After Al Oerter (discretion) and Carl Lewis (overside) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who controlled the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race, Phelps was led by another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the defenders of gold in the final career 50 put on a rough finish, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the official publication, he went to the finale of a 100-foot butterfly.
The legend could not be quenched by either a landscaper named Ryan Murphy, who won a double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the finale, he left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third end of the Rus Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only a fifth place out of 200s last year's World Championship, he became a signatory king in Rio.
Larkin, the one who made the same double at last year's world championship, was settled out of the customary throne.
At the Olympics, but he's only got a medal now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American woman Simon Manuel shared gold at the Kraulářská stow.
For the 16-year-old Oleksik it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel the second after the silver of the chauffeur.
Plavecký zlato won the OH as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become love for them, and they'll get to where I am, told by Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the race at 100 metres of butterfly in Rio and still has silver from the Kraulář's 200s.
By the sixth time the world record label of Australanka Cate Campbell ended.
The top two hundred won the Japanese Rie Kanet, for which it is the first Olympic Medal in the seventies.
It has no valuable metal nor world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by the Russian Julia Jefimov, who, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, is faced with the invulnerability of the viewers and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio has been able to do so at the special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the game began.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, or if she has any other opinion, whether she turns to arbitration, she added it.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the launch at midnight?
I don't remember.
Cheeks have been a strange day.
Only less than an hour before the fight, they knew who they were going to come up with.
They must have flashed the tactical preparation.
And then, in a non-conventional time, they started a game on a small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they pulled the lead of the opponent, but at 19:19 they couldn't handle the end.
In the second they were brighter and flattened, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a number of infected services meant losing 10:15 and saying goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat Russia," she regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start, before I did, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the final balloon, I had an income that I used to get used to.
We lost the set, which was key.
In the next set we entered them with a view on the field, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
There was a lot of broken applications in the tie-break, and we took it this way.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat Russia.
Sluck: Too bad the beginning of the first set, we got away there.
We've been able to pull it off, but we've missed the point.
The other set was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five that we've hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because Russia was playable.
How did you play in a little yard number one?
Slučka: Like in China in the suburbs.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, complete silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was different from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of your opponent an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We began to practice our game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation as for the other teams.
But Simon (the coach of Nausch) has prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactic paper ready, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you ever remember starting a game at midnight?
Hermann, I don't think so.
We played at 11, but not 12.
Block Russia Birlov in the playoff preschool at OH in Riu.
Beach volejbalists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in hugs in playoff for OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluck: By playing the last two games in the group from ten, we had a regime that had been shifted earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve hours.
But I think we've done the best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not very typical, and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the procedure from the group was our goal, it is fine on one side, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluck: I'm gonna sleep out of it, and I'm going to remember the Olympic tournament positive from tomorrow.
Big brother's here, here comes the first simmering SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who will decide to arrange SIM for one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
Therefore, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, which, for example, work in Thailand, have concluded marriages there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunication Commission Takorn Tantasith informed that there will be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIM intended exclusively for foreigners introduced the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to allow monitoring of their location are intended to introduce the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of preserving national security that will allow the criminal activity of a foreigner.
In addition, the so-called SIM tourist guests have the help of discovering those who exceed the permitted duration of their stay.
The sellers should thus appear on the side of the SIM exclusively designed for Thais and special SIMs for foreigners by six months.
Differentiality will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on in cards to people designated without Thai passports.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at SIM for Thailand is not because you can always easily watch," Tantasith added.
Nutno added that in Thailand, prepayments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one operator gave free startup SIM to tourists at airports.
That's how they were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia or Singapore.
Even these are currently subject to compulsory SIM registration, however, the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measures do not mean an obligation for foreigners to arrange for entry into the country of SIM of the local operator.
They can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country are known only by relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. when they enter the SIM to their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference between roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so strict that most tourists will also start looking after local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand were legally satisfied with immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, the system that has been drawn up compares to the obligation to provide residence address in immigration documents.
Moreover, the police will need a court order if necessary.
Any abuse of the system will threaten an unwarranted punishment.
"If the service provider follows the position of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the expiry of the 90-day period after which the SIM has not applied to the network, it could now be restored in Thailand after 15 days.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property care will be provided by the manager.
The condition was enough parking places and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old homes, troubles with swinging floors, high energy challenges and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old construction is unable to offer.
More interesting visitors can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamila Polák from Artiga studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
Cooperation with the architect would recommend to everyone if it proposes an apartment from the beginning, namely a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of a range of possible materials and, on the basis of customer's wishes, they are able to align the interior properly.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, on the basis of another client's personal recommendation, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished for a generous social and living space with adequate facilities for a four-member family as modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection between the apartment and terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, there was a need to bring about the quality of the design.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all designs including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the proposal has always come from architects.
In the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design, and we have shown some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mainly Czech authors, including Karl Malich's works, Karl Vysushila, Václav Špaly or Otto Gutfreund's architect, has helped us to become aware of our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We checked together with visualization.
Did any complications occur in the realization of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, join new ones?
Perhaps only at the initial stage of the project when we came to the construction when it was possible for the first time to rise up to the height of our floor, and they found that the views we had planned were actually the shadow of the surrounding buildings.
That's when we've literally changed the whole night from scratch.
The gulp was used on the kitchen line as well as the cover of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, then, the wooden surfaces supplemented by the skin, for example, are controlled by Norm’s menu of the dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or something that you wish otherwise today?
I think it's a modern air interior that's above all doing its job.
We do not miss the changes, most of the modifications after the incline took place in the same shade and residence of the terrace.
Perhaps the only extract is to the floor when walnut wood shows us as being too sensitive to home with dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornych, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to complete a completely new dispatch solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of the location of the lights into the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
That's how we got the light of day into the darkest space of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications which was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There's also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, it says Muslims living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where have you lived everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, close to the Spanish border.
I've been moving around quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalistics, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every French man was so negative.
People in France have been negatively lavishing in general, but it has been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativeism.
For some people, this is how they value Czech nature.
Believe me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people may not feel that way when they arrive in France because tourists don't see it that much.
But it was too much for me.
The big subject is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There's also a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
It's like I'm some evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job anywhere else, and I've come to an open place with Air France here in Prague.
I admit, I didn't know from the beginning of Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague at all.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a whole different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or abuses, but I have a feeling that people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress up anything, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable with people looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff like that.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think the men care about this kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel site for a while.
Then we started a website with one friend, where people offer and seek shared housing.
So far, we only work in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two friends of Chechky.
I have to say that the Czechs' other specifics are that at first they're more keeping their distance.
He won't let someone get to his body right away.
That's pretty different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it in Prague very simple, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even at nights or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by doing a little bit of communication in English, I don't have the need to learn a language so quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Did you meet any negative reactions?
Like because you're Muslim?
Pretty much not.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
One experience I can think of.
My manager, Češka, once told me about the French football team and she said something in a sense: They are not French, but Africans.
That's pretty much what I'm thinking.
But that someone would have a problem with the fact that I'm Muslim, that's not what happened to me.
Even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, they're gonna report to me.
In part, anti-Muslim demonstrations are related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can also happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, at this point, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I may not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it doesn't just concern Muslims.
Besides, Islam doesn't recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he's not God.
How do you feel when terrorists get caught by your faith?
It's hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I'm trying not to follow the news of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří's Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Did you register?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Are you meeting other Muslims in Prague?
My co-workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite a wild discussion about Islam, because we're all seeing him a little different.
I came from France, so I went through another education, and maybe they were learning Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes associate with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
I don't look under any circumstances.
Rather the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also involves that you have no headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And it's all signed up for the way I've been raised.
For example, my mother is really a basic Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but the scarf just doesn't wear.
She always taught me faith was a purely personal thing.
Depends on everyone who interprets it.
When you read the Qur'an, you should make your own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an, which says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the sight of others, I thought, "I'm not a prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarf is required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for me.
The Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The yacht of the Kozelska Fenclium wind in Riu is about to blow on the step rails.
Friday rides at sea in Brazil’s Riu de Janio went out to Czech yachters Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, it moved before the final two rides to the tenth place.
That would ensure the Czech Republic participate in the final ride.
You collect packages like pompions.
They want to compete for carriers.
The TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger is behind the idea of using the scheduled trip to transport packages.
With the idea, they breathed the life of the three applications with a different geographical range.
We launched the National Transfer app in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities recorded and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first before we focus more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz 11-year-old manager.
How can I take the app work, and who can benefit from it?
You download it and you register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how much you can transport and how much you want.
Someone needs a transfer on that day.
When the route and time of delivery meets, it binds, and both of them come to notice.
That's when the cabin opens, where the couples will set up a transfer.
How many people do you think it would be necessary to register for each package to always find its courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many journeys it takes to cover perfectly optimal conditions and each offer has paired with demand.
It's already working on the main tracks and it's logically easier than on the way between the village.
The more people, the more potential of speed and accuracy.
People are also building their trust and making sure no one runs away with the package.
So you haven't had to solve this case yet?
How many users have a service two months after the launch?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 people who create roads.
That's what we consider to be a success, and we believe that others will be packed up.
Doesn't it have to be safe for the sender to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates for just because we can deliver the thing one more day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay a few thousand for the big delivery company within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, it feeds around transnational carriers, as well as business chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found out that quality is not responsible for what they're paying for.
No one wants to find a note note in the mailbox that he's supposed to pick up the package at the branch office, and that first day after 19 o'clock.
I've needed a six-hour package this time, and I've been waiting home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't upset anyone and sends a signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Not one of them has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the application of the Shippansee LTD, which used to transport packages already planned between world metropolises, especially aircraft.
In 2015, they launched a project to process the company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took place in three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The application of the Transfer began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
It is a local version of the Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The project was developed from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The idea was from the start to make all these applications that will one day join in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adapt the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has recently been a topic and this is AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about the area where no one can say where the sharing limit is and where the gray economy is?
It's the same, just another product.
We know that if it's successful and we go up there, we're going to be more grass in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it's not an intention to circumvent financial offices and tax checks.
Any user, either on one or another, will be encouraged to make his income if he makes his income.
What do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender will save and make the transporter pay, and it will reduce the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In the time of the social networks that people divide, we would like to bring this contrast closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
The people in my opinion have been missing a personal approach for a long time, and we say this app is a service for people.
How, then, do you guarantee that a courier with a package won't run?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, shall scan the identity card and provide a bank connection, payment card or credit card.
These are the channels that serve as well as people of credibility.
The couriers also collect stars based on the evaluation of the senders.
We offer insurance, we still have the details.
In case of loss or damage, the courier is not liable under criminal law for its content if there is something illegal inside it and he doesn't know it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his trunk with a gun shot or ten kilos of hash, he'll be overrun by a criminal liability to the sender.
Doesn't the abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, an supervisory administrative authority which will be the only one to be able to look into it, even we cannot see them ourselves, the data are against abuse protected.
How much money does he get after a successful delivery of the consignment into the courier's hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's going to ask for.
In addition, the senders are charged several percent for making contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can blame the courier for not delivering the package when he actually delivered it, taking the delivery as well as verifying with QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
In relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, a small as a butter cube, medium as a plate of eggs and a big as a bass beer.
Then there is no further restriction and if someone has room in the car, he'll take over a fridge.
Plus has the ability to take pictures of the package, so the courier sees what it wants.
You don't even have to pack the matter unless you want to hide the contents.
You put the couriers in your hand forgetful, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, I wasn't paying much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach, which mainly aims at flying aircraft.
At that moment, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I wanted to become one and put my own savings into it.
Another year of development has lasted before we set up the entire product in London for greater creativity in the company Shippansee LTD.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing has been focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application because it has all had birth pains and is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market right now.
We know it's a long track running, but we're not letting go, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
I will take over when we said that the national segment can be far more interesting and that we will at least learn in the Czech Republic.
The third application by Mesem is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address even to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as much as I drive, but the difference is that you see as a courier in it as a destination in the form of points on a map that are closest to you, thanks to a geolocation in your phone.
The app for couriers who want to do this is called the Profi Mess.
So somebody can actually make a little extra money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be collected in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
Now, like everybody's fucking with those pompions, they can collect this all the same.
One sees where there are contracts around town, comes to that, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transported.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At this moment we are doing an web interface which will be difficult for companies to send shipments, to collect data about them, or to create points on the map.
We, then, are able to use their services every month.
Now you're looking at the full-time project?
It's bothering us, but we've got it normally at work so that we can make a living and develop the project.
There's no strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other came up with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to manage to finish off the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Story Part Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
That'll fix the second part and the solo game in it will be safer, according to the first information, than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of the main fastening in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which includes also the possibility of using the fighting Titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels that are focused on the circumstantial movement.
They will remind you of the platform and include rébuses.
Therefore, double jumps are essential to overcoming them, running through the walls and rope slides.
In addition, some of the enemies will have to be destroyed.
There will be no maps that resemble mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to raise the platform and close the massive doors.
You will modify the form of a battlefield.
Due to this, the speed of the game should encircling between angry events and quieter moments to explore the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's pawn with a dream about the pilot's career.
Cooper, in the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, will fail on the alien planet Typhon, which is occupied by enemy soldiers.
And he won't be a wildling to him.
In addition, in the crash, the Lastimos will suffer fatal wounds, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with establishing Captain's Titan.
His dream of pilot career will be fulfilled before he expected it.
The first step will be to steal the batteries necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls with the Titan will also be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the military past, but, at the same time, robot isolated communications will create humorous moments.
For example, if titanium is going to name all the injuries that come at Cooper's planned outage.
The first campaign information in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to evaluate in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the network game.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will live, however, the original publishing company remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of the publisher THQ in 2013, she received a number of her brands and the right to use the company's logo and name.
Nordic, for example, released the Darksiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, there are 23 more games for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been exposed.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first obviously, she tried for him for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date me like that.
She's completely mad at him.
On the first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl's, in love with a voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He went from work on a regular basis at half-quarter, and so she always went out at three to buy.
She tried every day to at least see him.
Later, I figured out they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I provided the keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, at the end of the day, I always stayed home.
I could never go in there, make that decision-making move.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe my wife has been handling me mentally.
Soon I think she found out I'm self-controllable that I'm gonna do what she wants.
And I did it.
Maybe I'm just a mess.
At the time, the neighbors told me that they knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only a daughter had any idea.
So I've always put it aside, gone on and on.
I went to his apartment once, so I could use some help at the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him I got an anonymous letter that he was meeting my wife and that he was pointing it out.
I asked him what he'd say.
He's standing there, he's shoving his shoulders, staring at the ground, and he didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife once on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been going anywhere, who's got a hard time meeting someone else, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with all this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife's housekeeper.
She's always done everything at home-- cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
I think she's always been trying to keep me from complaining.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to bury her, hug her, and she won't let herself.
At the same time, we go for walks and shopping, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
When it started, and I carried it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and calling on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims themselves don't help the state against those who distort public freedom, it will still be harder for France to guarantee the freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing the Mosque from abroad, when money and money often come to the preachers of the jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005, by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already intended to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the Mosques and the countries which finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was hit by internal failures, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
In the head of the new foundation, the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the advocate of the secular state.
In France, about 2500 Mosques and prayer, about 120 of them serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have fired about 80 Islamic clergy and consider this step in several decades.
German police also hit the Jihadist clergy this week.
Imam reportedly recruiting warriors for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikharian temple in Essen.
Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on the new institution was set up in France, which will replace the functional foundation.
All of them speeded up other terrorist attacks that radical Islamists carried out in the name of the Islamic State.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure funding of the Mosque from home resources and also to oversee the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it receives finance, although it is considering several proposals.
One of them is a special food hall fee, namely, meat derived from slaughter in accordance with Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the shopkeepers for the provision of a permit.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who are going to Mecca.
Every year, on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, about 30,000 of them come out of France.
Moreover, in French Mosques, only preachers who went through educational programs at the universities there should act.
This is why their preaching should be consistent with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December, and others will follow," said Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly hurt by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in the north Spanish Zaragoza, writes the journal Independent.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage space in their car.
A man waited in a car outside of the shopping center, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, a man then turned the gun against himself, writes an Independent.
A woman took an unharmed daughter to the hospital, an ambulance must have come for a man in critical condition.
There was about 11.00 in the central part of the metropole autonomous area of Aragonie, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency, Europa Press writes down the Independent that the motive was probably an unsolved recent divorce between the two partners.
Baptism bulbs, walnuts, ginger and chilli sauce.
This summer survives light, well fed food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our taste and our head.
And so from the summer garden smells of grilled necks, bulls, pork chops.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, even so sometimes except salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is saving time and dishes, and it's a social thing, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to do well with the delicacy of the special tablery, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is nothing long to cook, to care, to fry or to suffocate.
And they're going to help us get healthy.
Whether it's domestic Sushi or sashimi, where high-quality raw materials and a few well-greed grifts can be enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself is a real exotic delicacy.
Just like any easier roll in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time-consuming cooking and the cooling of rice falls off.
The paper can only be softed in water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with fillings and supplements.
It's not like an eyelash.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine dishes today is that raw materials are generally available.
Including loaded sweet ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying Sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the true pink suit has a unique sleek sharpness and also a delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it mixes with several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag matching size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, promoting digestion and resistance to cough or flu is finished.
Banna leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures for serving and decorating dishes in various solemn opportunities and rituals.
Long-grained banana leaves are very widespread in a number of Asian countries or South America as well as a "help" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes that are packed in like alobal.
The banana leaf then conveys the food with a specific flavor.
In our shops, they can be purchased with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of a wheel.
But choose only leaves of green seed, and thus healthy - unraveled and spotless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from eyelashes, sesame and sesame oils.
He can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will especially know the algae of the Norwegians.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying so-called list of Norwegians, i.e. those designed specifically for the production of sushi.
Wakame is a dark green algae growing in waters around the island of Hokkaidó - it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae of the Norwegians.
By the way, if anyone didn't know the miso soup with the wakame, the Asian women are probably using it for recovery after delivery.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Clean blood, strengthens the circulation, even allegedly prevents gray hair and is literally charged with mineral substances.
Dried and broken wakame also serves as spices, for example to taste rice.
Fresh algae first let the water be washed, then washed, put into boiling water and cooks for half a minute.
Then they cool down in ice water, cut off the middle ribs and adjust, like a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it already done, freezing it is the easiest solution.
So it is only to soak a roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-lasting bomb.
If you resist, and you don't throw in the grilled cane.
Eating healthy, lightly and lightly.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of skillfulness, and you have interesting fresh food that conveniently combines flavors.
And it's done once two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radishes, 100 g green bread, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g algae wakame and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
The back of the meat root, a spoon of black sesame, a spoon of the serracha chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g of the loaded gari of ginger, a bit of pini nuts.
Let's get our threads ready first.
We'll put rice paper in the cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we'll cook baptismal shoots shortly, about three minutes after we'll get them cooled into ice water so they won't lose color.
Let's put vegetables in the allowed paper and pack.
We will prepare the filling from the white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put them into rice paper.
On the banana note, we put the baptizers in, add the threads, and at the end of the whole dish we'll get the eyelash, loaded with ginger, mango slice, slice the black sesame, and add a few pin nuts.
The British must be satisfied with silver in a seven-point rugby, a choice of Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7th Rugby ended with a destructive lead on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night Britta at Deodoro Stadium here at Rio high 43:7.
The Fijis have demonstrated a master's lesson in processing, dumps, attacks, support games, running on the counter and brutal forces - and they have gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unscrupulous price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympics tournament of the 7th Rugby, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The win over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinal of the same day, may have died in the final.
However, Fiji would in its form defeat a 15 - team in full health.
You don't write it for the British will not be comforted, but they may rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fiji is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has hurt a little bit of the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began with greatness, the British passages reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and champions of the World Cup led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau appeared from behind the corner.
Timemaker showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing of the conversation.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the great Leon Nakarav and prevent him score the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua threw touchdown into the right corner and the British were losing 17:0.
He added the nakarava after another return, and at the clock there were still more than 1 minute left... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvoum then penetrated the small British, and fell on the lajna where he was scored.
After the conversion to 29:0 a break followed.
It was like Fiji for ragby 7s was born while the British were still learning how to transfer.
That's what it's like.
After half-time, the British made mass changes and Fijani's power stopped... for a long four-minute period, which compared to the first half-time was good until after the brilliant inter-heating of Fiji Josua Tuisova was no further penetrated.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner on increased an at 36:7. But the match had already won the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans in the ochos sang, had flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the totally joyous approach of the Fijis.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame has yet another attempt to win the Fijis.
The whistle was called, the Fijis were hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely capable.
Even before that, the same day Fiji beat Japan 20:5 in the semifinal, and Britain was able to make South Africa in a tight semifinal - by the difference of one conversation.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dain Norton's dazzling foot work, broke the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the 15th team of England, has won and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning for victory in the rowing race inspired the fight against the cancer coach
You can't find any more emotional gold on these castles, and that's what you're gonna say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing breaths to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While two were sitting in the village, there were three voices in the boat, and when the boat was blasted at the level of the second Olympic gold behind them in the female couple race, there was still a voice of the still present coach Robin Williams with them, and they are the first women in the history of British sport, which achieved such a result.
Their surplus was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained uninterrupted.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how they fly after the water level with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
For every gold medal of rowing is a batalion of helpful hands, which means a little by bit the difference, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he would live this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered a cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I've undergone this operation.
Without an operation, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Then it changes your view of things.
Cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
Lucky for the entire trio was that he could have received treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and cut down the drop at the minimum - if so we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked in the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps would do.
That's how it started.
It's the way of rowing itself, but this was a little more demanding.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual, trying to overcome his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the regiment of King Gunnery, who had a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions on the bottom, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it highlights how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked too.
Up until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be nobody, so he owns a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
The two put on a stunning rhythm whose rivals couldn't equal themselves.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark started getting closer, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the moment, we were focused.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and, at the same time, we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to have a good time, go out and win the race, which we did.
Two will take a year to decide what happens next.
Glover is getting married next week, her present is the television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
London took about six months to find out I'm an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes to get here.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
More like a free rider, says a taximafie Rubesh hunter to a ground-breaking prosecution.
Six taxi drivers and a former Magistrate official in Prague are, as she said, defendants.
You have filmed a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices and those who are to be in the group that will happen in court.
You've faced a few unpleasant struggles with exposed actors.
How much is the report on the prosecution of members of the organized group translated?
I was expecting some court to happen.
I'm especially curious about the judgment.
I don't think they should be in prison.
That's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all the people free of charge.
That's a somewhat arbitrary solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider any punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's sufficient that some of them are so afraid that they don't work anymore.
For example, one of them makes a poodle, another one takes a pizza, and one of them blew it all out.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Is that an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the company they took.
For the quarter of the century, they committed the destruction of our country's name and theft of people.
So let them do a good card right now, and they're considering people for free.
I can't imagine it any different.
It would work like a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they get a car and free drive people around Prague.
No, I really think they'll get parole at the end of the day, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Písek and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with virtual videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as a editor for the internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, he is now preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is primarily designed for foreign viewers.
In the form of brief reports, Rubesh advises what services I prefer to avoid in Prague and what vice versa it recommends without fear.
Previously, he recorded a series with names How to, City of scams?, Life in luxury, and enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
In the prosecution, they are referred to as an organised group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fake taxis be referred to as mob?
They're so cute mobmen, not what we know from Godfather.
It's more of a mob -- juniors, but it's organized for sure.
It's just that they're guarding each other's drawers.
Prague is all distracted.
I observed that, for example, the main station does not like to go with Paris, Paris is not happy with taxis waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone just keeps their seat, and each group is kind of organized.
It's probably a full net.
But the defendants are only seven people together, six taxi drivers, and one former Magistrate officer who warned the driver before the controls.
As you say yourself, the side effects didn't disappear from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague frauds in a taxi service according to your estimate is?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryyak.
This is a man who is truly dangerous - in his car he carries a telescopic shoe, and every Friday, and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and the cart people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted seven hundred for three kilometers.
His police didn't stop for a reason.
Only a few people picked out of the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also in other places in Prague.
So it is difficult for seven people to expel the famous Prague neškar, which apparently has much bigger dimensions.
It's not a big deal, of course.
It will help, but all evil will not get away with it, that's true.
There are taximakers who rob foreign tourists, still in the same places that you showed in the reports, namely Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and they violate the decrees every day.
It's ignoring both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's an indifference.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even though they're just part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's already broken.
I therefore have to ask: do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong because my goal was, is, and always will be, to improve the centre of Prague.
And even though I feel like I need to be a little bit better, I'm gonna keep doing this.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not like that, of course there's more.
Are you trying to confront them all the time in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test driving, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught one cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although then claimed that it was CZK 56 (he used a ten-line trick).
He had a receipt, the cops arrived, and this cab driver was so cute that he was still going to see those cops, asking them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The cab driver over at a taxameter pasted the decimal line and robbed tourists about 357 crowns.
Is it possible to say that the mutilation of fake taxi drivers did not proceed even after you showed the faces of those who charged pointless amounts for short driving?
Their anger is still incredible.
How did the 56 crowns with the cab driver?
The cops sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss it on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And that will be, I think, the problem with this court (a few taxi drivers and one exorcist).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate must not use the secret vehicle records of taxi service as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their fraud, the cabbies pointed me out to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for the news.
Are you concerned that this fact might even protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns a kilometer because he wouldn't be alive.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal line, which, in particular, in front of foreign clients, is an underwater taxi.
Is it still up to date, or are they concerned about this line after the publication of your reports to continue using?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending the show.
I used to ride with one cab driver, bragging about me being the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that a little black boarded from the side of a taxameter.
When I asked him what it had, he said, "You know what it is."
If there's too much fine on the taxi driver, can a court with their colleagues be wary of them?
Is there anything that can keep them from cheating?
You've talked about how you think you're gonna cheat, they'll always find.
I don't think there's anything left to betray.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there.
I must say from my experience that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are in a position to prevail.
But do they want to go against those who preach the reputation of their services?
They've got a taste, but they're missing an um.
He can't do it much, and he can't say exactly what they want to say.
When they set up this demonstration (because of a proposal for full-scale restrictions coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they wouldn't test against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as that of his service, then they claimed they wanted more than Uber.
It was just that they blocked Prague and it resulted in only the best possible commercial for Uber.
How do you overall assess the approach of the Prague Magistrate to solve the problem of pre-trading the ticket?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to enter into this to resolve something.
Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that had information, which means the taxi department had done its job for several years completely.
I hope they charge this official into the last check of all the frozen checks to realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can think of.
I've even been with him on one check-up, which I found out later on from their schedule.
It's been several months since the last series of series was published.
What's the response?
I'm thinking mostly of foreign viewers, but they're the most focused series than they actually are.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I give them the videos.
And then when we're going after the Old Town Square, there's a surprise that the same people there that see them are really standing.
Unfavorable Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I would have built a mole around them so that people would look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need to?
Sure.
I ride with services I don't have to pay cash but a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no possibility of fraud.
But there are a lot of dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a cab in the street once since then.
After I got in the car, the driver said, "Well, now, you've got the courage."
Bém in the changeover for the Italian tourist.
It's been written about fake taxi practices in 2005.
In the same year, some former Mayor Pavel Bém went on a check-up trip to the Italian tourist, and immediately at the first attempt, the driver engulfed it by two hundred.
Editor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for a trip from the Old Town Square to the Václavské náměstí náměstí 820 crowns, which is about CZK 195 per kilometer, as the authors of the reports calculated.
The Prague magistrate set a maximum price to 28 kron for a kilometer.
In the recorded reports there are also other surprising sums: for example, a two-mile walk from the streets of Paris to Truhlářová cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Dear rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
Six hundred crowns are required to be charged for the Angel, which is 2.5 km away.
The marble washes mostly pure water, the most without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurity comes well, even if sometimes the dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it needs to be eroded out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not fast, it's closer to the restaurant Vanes Trost from Oldřichov in Hájích.
A hat down before it: the gravestone is built by lying, after which it is necessary to climb out and to climb again.
"The Restaurant should be careful, patient and non-lethal on the work environment," concluded.
It's not nearly her first restaurant job in Frydlantsk.
Thanks to it, the restoration of stone elements of the façade in the back of the frýdlantian town hall was restored, and the statues of the holy Mará Magdalene in Zátíš, St. Jan Nepomucký in Frýdlanta, Pieta in a frýdlantian street, Mariánské column in Frýdlant or atlanta in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
With the restoration of Melchior's tomb, Kryštof and Kateřina of Rederno, it began in 2011 in Frýdlant.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the fertilisation of dirt and cartilage, the free stone parts shall be assured against the fall and the shift; either they are anchored in the wall or to each other.
There's the same treatment and preservation of the surface.
Texts on the tomb will be re-sealed.
"After this, the reference to the State Memorial Care of the Municipal Office in Frydlant Věra Sobot begins with the recordings on the marble boards.
From the past, there's no record of a tomb going through some repairs.
At a closer glance, it takes holes, drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's the remains of the tombstone.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the raid of the Swedes in the Thirty Years War, everything disappeared.
Literally, the gravestone was crammed, noted Saturday.
In the church, finding the Holy Cross are restaurants with a mild superstructure at home.
After the 2010 flood, it was necessary to put in order the tombs, which were under water, were restored to the baptismal, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to move into the future," Sobot betrayed.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restaurant work on the restoration of the redernovist tomb comes to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid out of subsidies, the city will not put any money into this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will be just from a prize in a regional round of the historic city of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, explained the Mayor of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the winnings to restore the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indexes and comparisons to the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half of the year.
The markets control low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The S&P500 index, which in February went through 12% corrections today is at a new historical maximum and has already added 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
Thus, the iron rule reaffirms that long-term traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which they have always achieved so far.
In a situation where American shares on the historical maximum are again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets were satisfied and fearlessly grew due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stablely below the 12 percent.
And don't.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full current and last week the Bank of England also added its hand to the work, which will purchase bonds in the next six months in volume of £70 billion.
The new wave of quantitative release therefore pushes such low yields below and contributes to almost complete removal of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this state last?
Of course, that's a millionth question.
However, there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through nearly constant growth without greater fluctuations, commodity market situation, and China is stabilising and brixit is essentially no longer a topic, so we probably shouldn't be surprised if American shares were to survive in the same peaceful regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and demanding task.
I wanted for this difficult work of an experienced policy, said the Head of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (really experienced, because the so-called "European elite" example of the "European elites" was difficult to look for) to appoint the European Commission the conditions for the departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection blew up the signs that it is in serious interest of the EU to seek with Britain the form of future friendly co-existence.
But most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
The barnier is a rock European federalist.
She hates Great Britain.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he could only take it: a crammed enemy of the English concept of the free market and a model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and is interested in everything that comes from the London financial center of City, established legislation that was frozen by tough regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unfamiliar, and perhaps even a carefree bargainer.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how to remember the quiet and friendly distribution of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of Prime Minister Václav Klaus has contributed.
Therefore today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It's a shame Juncker learned from Václav Klaus - at least in this - he didn't learn.
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
Lord Kremlin has released his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the office of the President's office on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media about it and appealed to Kremla’s press release.
Putin, however, indicated Ivanov's release at his own request.
At the meeting that Rossija 24 transmitted to television station, the president said it was based on Ivan's wish to be the chief of the President's office for at least four years.
At the same time, Ivanov announced that he would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The exchange report at the head of the President's administration, which will now lead Ivanov's present representative, is considered to be quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest co-workers.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the function of Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
Now the chair of a member of the President's Security Council will leave.
Ivanov, meeting with Putin, however, said that he was the length of his stay at the head of government of the State's chief recordkeeper.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had been trained in this function for 25 years since it was set up.
Even Uncle's doubles don't play Safář's finals.
So far, neither one of the Friday tennis matches managed to turn into a final.
As the first to lose Petra Kvitová, who according to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after set 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová followed Czech debutists Šafřevíva with Strýcová for a while.
In the first hundred years, Sister Williams’ slayers had lost two hundred, and the Russians finally made a set in a short game.
The second set then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Riu recorded Czech rowing: Ondrej Synek with an overview won his semifinals when the other Damir Martin from Croatia defeated over the freedom at the end of almost a second.
Today's good, conditions were great, the wind's calmed down.
I was trying to save as much as possible, said Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So it took them some power, that would be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing cards for me, the row of the Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková didn't walk in Snyky's shoes.
The five-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semifinal, and on Saturday she will start at the B finale and fight 7 to 12th place.
That's not how the London gold works.
I didn't go to the finals for the first time at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a high-quality race, and I put everything that went on.
Soupers were just better. Topinková Knapková leaned in front of them.
She fought till the end, and she believed she was going to make it to her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight has given up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced that anyone could move out of this field.
I was surprised by Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get Rakushaku to the finale.
Unfortunately, today the race of life was on its way, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates of Riu remained the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who, for the second time, could not get away with the qualification, this time the leprosy in lie.
In it Nepejal occupied 33th place.
It's the best thing to do with the Russians.
From the first turn, Sergey Kamenskij followed 629 points, of the second Kiril Grigorjan (628.9).
The non-Security shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes, including Czech seven-year-olds Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klutinová spoke to the program in Rio.
Cachové belongs after the second event of the Olympic competition 11th place, the Czech recordkeeper Eliška Klužinová is twenty-two-nine.
He led Britka Katarina Johnson-Thampson, who jumped to the height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissato Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best height performance within seven.
They tried to jump at 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the questions raised as follows: The German society has gone through deep disflexions, while Russia does not.
In both the great Eurosian nations there were dictators in the 20th century, and they became powerful of the regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 have contributed a great deal to 94 million victims of communism, as stated by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war management or inhuman experiments.
In a non-human way, the Nazis destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II, estimated to be 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets carried out at the detainees or deserted territories.
There were not only a few individuals in Germany or the USSR, but a large part of the nation participated actively, passively or simply cowardly or in sand with a head.
This is not just a specificity of these nations, we Czechs are alike guilty.
In Germany the immediate end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Court.
The most important thing, however, came later.
When the kids grew up, they asked, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such superstitions?"
How could you do that?
This brought true reflexion and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites have been concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they have other (sometime nationalistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to connect it back to Alaska-Lotrinsko or someone - to revanš - military attack - perhaps everyone recognizes that.
After the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflexion.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when a former officer of the KGB (sic!) Vladimir Putin got into power.
Often a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of the Russians is the revanš, the conquering of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people is no value to the trust.
Fight yours, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it's just those decades of despoting that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - destined for Asian (sebe) tyranny.
Who's increasing tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-russian border in Crimea has worsened.
Who's growing tension benefiting?
After a longer period of relative peace, there has been a further deterioration in the relationship between Ukraine and Russia.
The municipality of the Ukrainian party became the peninsula Crimea, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports of both disobedient parties are against each other, and it is difficult to verify independently, and so we have the opportunity to think only of the old-known question to whom does this benefit?
According to the Moscow reports, there was a terrorist attack on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, rejects Ukraine, and on the contrary, accuses Kreml of provocation.
Information on arrests of Ukrainian Special Forces in Russia came from the case of pilot Savchenková's known answer that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would help Russia to make the situation worse around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further confirmation of sanctions and strengthening the anti-russian campaign.
In the last year, the background of the immigration crisis to Europe has resulted in a withdrawal of attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s leadership has already lost its total credit when President Porošenka’s current support is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would long ago be bankrupt if it were not a generous financial injection by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention again to its country in order to justify its other requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before the voters in their country.
President Porosenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show up again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
There is no hope that all those who attempt to bring about an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realise their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but of all ordinary people on both sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria has shown inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate reached 1 % in July.
This is the highest in several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, CPI measured over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, thus monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the travels of these consumer goods groups was recorded: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), culture and recreation (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Price decreases occurred in garments and footwear (2,2 %), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0,0 %), health (0,1 %).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training remained.
The U.S. secret services were watching Russian hacking attacks a year ago.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the party's democratic headquarters.
But no official report mentions the Russian share of the attack.
Moscow denied the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, because it would reveal that the American secret services of the hacker attack would also be how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack event.
New Cyber Safety Advisory Board
The footage of the Russian trace was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight chief members of Congress, called gang eight, have been informed of public officials.
It is created by the heads of both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the President of the Democrats in both the chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress's office and security committees.
The President-in-Office of the Democratic Party Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that she was creating an Advisory Board for Cyber Safety, which is to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for the Democrats' servers".
He was a dangerous parasite in a man named salmon from Albert.
The director apologized.
On the basis of the consumer’s initiative for health problems after food consumption Losos wild smoked - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016, Prague hygiene was carried out in shops Albert in Wenceslas Square and On Bridge.
The audit found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer has notified, is no longer available and therefore the product was removed from the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm digesting the tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a man - larvae in the body cavity or muscle fish are a strong allergen and a man with a eaten live larva can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Štich.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately downloaded this batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
There was a doubt on the supplier's side, and at the same time we allowed this product to be tested, said the New York spokesman Alberto Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chains and get the money back.
Larvae will destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton, the Vržena.
The presence of a dangerous product has been informed by the Prague and the Mediterranean veterinary administration.
According to the server, carefree food.cz people can get sick with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, or illness can occur without a sign, said the CTK.
The symptoms will reach an hour up to two weeks after consumption of unheated fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larva disease, most spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adults worms and larvas are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or in freezing.
The vets have now checked salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples tested had parasites in them.
The shipment took 1700 products to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expeditioned, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, it was 919 packages today.
There is currently a withdrawal of the unsold stock of the product from the sales, said SVS spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples have prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Britta wanted to flee Cancer, apparently killed her Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and rapid marriage to the jihadist, who was killed, there was a sobering up.
The expected paradise of a chalephate was turned into hell for the British girls in the land from which there was no escape.
A girl was in contact with her sister Halima according to her relatives.
She repeatedly phoned her in Britain and said she wanted to go home.
Leave the Islamic state is like trying to escape from the Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, quote The Telegraph lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnima Akunje.
The last clues led to Rakka, the last call from there was a girl.
Then only news of her death has come, which can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in East London.
Together, they discussed how she could get out of Cancer and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to meet a former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could flee, because the house in which she was staying was compared in May with the countries of air raiding was introduced by the British ITV News.
Television reported that the bomb apparently dropped off a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You'd lift the blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area, said Tasni Akunje, family lawyer.
In the week of (Qizza) thinking about the escape from the Islamic State, one Rakushanka was tried to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she had it out as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to the BBC of Akunje.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas spent their trip on 17 February last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they aimed at Gatwick Airport and from it via Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
A family of girls according to a lawyer did everything she could to get Kadiz back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could to drink all the power to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking being caught on their own, he added a lawyer.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadiza's fate can be used as a repugnant case for other girls or even boys who let go of Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how they had things there, understood how far this was different from those of the Islamic state propaganda, and wanted to come back," he continued to Akuje.
The fate of the Kadiz's classmates is not known.
However, as their families were also silent, they must be reconciled to the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
Many centuries, the village of Inveray was a regional center and seat of Duke of Argyl.
From the middle of the 18th century, courtes and basements were served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were pathetic and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move to a new location in the prison.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcome to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it has not been in operation for long, its closure took place for economic reasons already in the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair equipment was expensive for operation and it had not been paid too much.
The stories of criminals and ghosts hunts.
For the public, the prison opened for centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with a new building to see how different conditions prevail in them.
Guides in daily costumes make an authentic experience even more powerful.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment they used on criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
In the framework of the tour, tourists may be allowed to close into one of the cells, usually due to photographs of the monument, or to cause a feeling behind bars of prisoners.
In addition, Inveray's prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it seems to be haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone there, and this museum allows people to come hunting.
Such a night will come to £300, which is about CZK 9900 in the conversion.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction it also attracts great food, surrounding panoramics and history.
“Anime” effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an animation, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and to face the identity of ways that cross absurdity.
You can make an pineapple, a dog or a character that looks like she's coming out of Roy Lichtenstein's picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
The Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticisms about the fact that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white shades of skin as the ideal of beauty.
So if this week, when the users offered a filter that made them have clean eyes, curved teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it racist Asian caricature - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious questions would point to the greater problem of society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and bitterness spread quickly and Snapchat immediately said that the function had been cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: Filterr was intended to express accounts to the characters of the animated characters, not as the caricature of Asians.
But the observers who witnessed racism reminded the filter of painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without packaging, refused comparison with the animated ones.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photos was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian caricature and the effects of the filter.
It appears that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is attached to the despised extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeded these cultural limits.
America's culture seems to have an endless struggle on diversity and inclusion, from the meeting halls in the corporations to Holywood and the equipment that we all wear in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on the Snapchat - who are more racially divisive than their older partners - could mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive for some user,” said Pope Katie Zhuová on Thursday in an interview, “it’s very difficult to handle these things today without notice, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer who works for the Media, decided to delete his Snapchat account on Thursday and invite the others to do the same.
In the article for Media and in the interview on the phone, she said that she is convinced that racial motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the predominant white, completely male leadership, and the article ended with hash tag: #DownteSnapchat.
“It’s either that employees have no diversity and colourful people when they decide these things,” said Zhuová, who has a Chinese-American origin, “or color people work there, but not on positions to feel secure or pleasant to speak.”
Other observers share its view - the complaint Snappchat left to a large extent without an answer.
The company does not publish the figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to speak about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, she recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on a insufficiently represented population and on internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other such users who can say it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Military officers have distorted the intelligence information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee in the report on Thursday stated that the officers of the United States Central Command changed the news reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they provided the events in the country.
According to the preliminary report by the Republican Chairman of the Military Forces Committee, the Committee on Information Services and the Defence Sub-optimal Committee, a ‘extensionful dissatisfaction’ between the Central Intelligence Analyses, according to which their superiors have changed their assessment of their efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The reports of secret services approved by Centcom’s superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by the facts on earth, and they were more consistently positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when a false analysis has been submitted to the superior politicians," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
Failures in Centpo leadership go to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes the continuing problems of central staff in describing and analysing US efforts in the training of Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the leaders of Obama administration ordered the reports to be amended, it is noted in the report that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present an optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State or the IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many central staff press releases, statements and statements from the congress were significantly more positive than what events actually were,” says the report.
For example, the Centcom representative publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosulu could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic state.
"This is completely clear after the months of the investigation," said Mr. Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican party from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, they manipulated the highest position of the US Central Staff intelligence services with the outputs of Staff intelligence services with the aim of bagatizing the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans compiled a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts about the handling of intelligence services relating to the Islamic State.
After the report published on Thursday, it must follow further investigation.
In Centcom's intelligence services, further investigations are being carried out by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democrat members of the Information Services Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“Mezi years 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very close process to produce an assessment of IS and Iranian security files,” said the member Adam B. Schiff, president of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “has led to a twisting of news service output,” he damaged morals between analysts and “did not take into account disapprovely. ”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence of the White House’s attempts to push the analysts of the Centcom to adjust their conclusions according to the “first or political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published on Tuesday at the Daily Beast.
Last August, New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation into the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was launched after complaints of the Centre’s analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, spokesperson of the Pentagon, stated that the Ministry of Defence will not comment because the investigation of the General Inspector continues.
However, he stated that “the experts sometimes disagree with interpreting complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue regarding these fundamental issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications over the question of whether Americans being bombarded in Iraq and Syria are successful (a proposal that now declares a growing number of defence leaders).
However, last year's accusations have called on the questionors about how much President Obama can rely on the fact that central staff are sincerely valued by military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The crisis of intelligence about the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than ten years, when the intelligence analyst of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper showing that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - was defending a small unit in Iraq and giving little time to think about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in opposition to the Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that, despite the public statement of the opposite air strike against the Islamic State's refineries, no significant financial resources of this terrorist group had been weakened because the group has built temporary refineries and oil sells on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not handed over to the central staff.
Commander of Centcom, Gen Lloyd J. Austin III, was subjected to criticism last year after many legislators met the testimony of the Senate too positive by the evaluation of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The US has won the fourth row of ground hockey, so today it will play a decisive game in the team of Great Britain.
Katie Bam in the fight against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, scored three goals and only one day later, for the American team of ground hockey, she scored the first two goals of the match in which India beat 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success of a good memory, but Bamová (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever managed something like this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong among those who write their goals.
But this is what Americans know: at the Olympics tournament lead to 4:0 and divide by the first place in the group with the Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified until the quarter finals, and the match decides who of the six teams will end up in the first place and who will be in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid a little longer the strong Danes, who are headed for the second group.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, Americans have triggered their surprising ride here, four years after they ended up with 12 teams in London.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time on the ground hockey game she took to her hand when she was 3 years old (its older twins played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
She escaped from the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get into the final magazine.
Then came the year 2012, when she didn't succeed, nor the members of her team.
The next year, he was appointed Englishman Craig Parnham, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of working as we have today.
We made a full turnover.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of her shooting goal with bekende from nearby.
India entered the match without victory in the tournament, but the team appeared surprisingly hard and maintained score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamová took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then she slipped into the middle and shot the ball in the goal to get the American to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in half a quarter.
The elimination of the American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one goalie, was the first to have a tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
“Now we are in a good place,” Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic woe
No matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - the Olympics.
The event in Riu de Janeiro is to feel persistent, indescribable and captured by changing competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot pin that's passed away from the archer, the gymnastics and the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbor's interview in a coffee shop without hearing about Simon Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the involuntaryness between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley's, too.
Dooley, the coming lover of women with milk in their faces, is for the first time in the Olympics, and could also be among those whose names will sound in households in the main broadcasting time between advertising and spots of sponsors, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps on trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't light on all competitions the same.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in a classic swim style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may appoint my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous spell of trampoline.
Although jumps are on the trampoline by Olympic sports since 2000, when they were first shown in Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention this sport is almost without notice - many people I asked, did not know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US never won a medal in the trampoline jumps, and up until 2012 none of the athletes reached the finals.
The prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year's gold medals from London will be to present Dong Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The trampoline jumps still have further bad luck, partly because the unacquainted ear would seem more likely to fit in the clown university than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but I'm just an exhilarator watching the country.
It has a comic potential - a comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” meaning “skacan record.”
The aspiring champion jumps on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters, and they present compositions with several elements (salta, swings and combinations) before they finally land again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty and air-income days.
Twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual Olympic Track trajectory is ahead.
Fighters for gold medals must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes until the end, some other time back and forth, up and down.
He tries not only to catch up with the target tape or the starting wall, but as television news says, but also with a different idealine: the world record or Olympic record.
This unanimity effort is noblesy, admirable, a little fantastic - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting, too, when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps on trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
It's not like moving forward.
He or she bounces, like they're in a state without burden, like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again, effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, neither difficulty can it, but for the duration of the assembly there is no raging struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only the perfect, smooth running of time and gravity.
This is just the closest time the Olympics and the Zen get closer.
The qualifications and finals of women are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, the male contest then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC station will be broadcast in the afternoon block, which starts for both days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a calm, pleasant moment, which, despite the rest of the fight, you will probably oversee.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the male athletes being the subject of a loved view and ambitation - as the Wall Street Journal magazine recently suggested the gymnasts of the United States - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans to swim in the air.
“Protest generations” in Ethiopia, the United States’ long-term allies
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requesting political change in Ethiopia have struck a violent opposition to the government.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during a meeting with the police.
Is war threatening in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has maintained anti-governmental unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
Just in the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets and demand major political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was insolent.
Witnesses say that the cops have been shot and killed by a bunch of disarmed demonstrators.
On collapsing videotapes from protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, the members of the security forces are captured, as they beat young people with sticks after they were forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa research project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most popular nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services work closely with the Etiopans to remove the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, obtain such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - in the capital of Addis Abeba, even a new suburban train runs.
And the streets of the city are typically calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - a human rights-fighting organization without stopping talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been oppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been declared, imprisoned, killed, or banished far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“If you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break,” Seyoum Teshome, who teaches the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's testing all the youths.
He's been testing generations.
Complaints are many, and they all relate to disputes about land after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last chair of the snuffed opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. A conflict along this improbably marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anyitists fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less oppressed over the past years, such as the Oromian Liberation Front or the Ogagen National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have become worse after years of touch under the surface.
The first one is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Etiopans can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and have improved the provision of internet services.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, such as normally happening during protests, many people can still communicate through an Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Etiopans spoke of how they gathered at protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long age of Amhar, mostly of the Christian highs of Ethiopia, they were evicted in politics and trade and used by Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and living in the lowlands.
But that changes as well.
“We are on our way to the united leadership,” said Mulata Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is not correctly dominated by the members of the Tigraj ethnicist, which account for around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister of the Government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he fell to an undisciplined disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterly able to reveal the initial signals of dissatisfaction and use the emissaries to process and get on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, analytics of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrayan region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no trust in security services controlled by the Tiggers.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
The last thing Ethiopia experienced was such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts referred to as the election that the government took and then stole.
He followed a hard intervention during which many protesters were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of unrest has passed over relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesting in Gondar, Gondar, was attacked by business owned by Tigres and the fear against the Tiggers on social networks is becoming more common.
Analysts say that protests put U.S. and other Western allies into an unpleasant situation.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently stated that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an unsustainable area.
"This," said Addi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as a “sacassm”
Donald J. Trump tried to baborate on Friday the latest controversy that floods his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of a terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the capacity of the Republican candidate for President to speak clearly with the American public.
They also put his advocates in an awkward situation, who fought to defend him in a turbulent time, and must explain that he might not have been serious about his comments.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, and in talks he insisted that he really had no intention of saying that the president and H. Clinton IS created.
However, in a Twitter contribution on Friday morning Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the claim of an old one day when Trump said in several interviews that he meant seriously.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to ease the note by reminding Obama was seeking to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate for the president did not react.
The most recent storm comes when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in the electoral surveys are falling.
Trump and Clinton were involved in a duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this topic.
On Twitter, he once again warned that the Clinton proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and said that according to which it was boring.
Trump used sarcastic defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he was cleaning up the critic wave, when he came up with a suggestion that the Russians should get into clinton's e-mails later to explain: "I'm obviously sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and ease them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some of his supporters’ response reports have to find out how they react, and according to the reaction one or the other way “go further explain” said Ruth Sherman, a specialist in communication that followed the language that both candidates used.
However, I also think that he's a knack in his statements and he knows that they're sufficiently vague to be able to explain differently.
Since the results of the electoral surveys continue to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen a more lenient tone in recent days, instead of making things gentle for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump was with a great distance behind Clinton, North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid excuses for provocative statements he says, but he often blames his criticism for misinterpretation of his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But, as Trump, in the final months of the presidential campaign, he was faced with increased attention, he put Trump's jokes into the uncomfortable situation of his dedicated supporters, who must publicly state behind him, whatever his comments are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York, who is one of the most prominent Trump's supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true, in the sense that, in front of Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization which was completely misrepresented by a novice, and that was because he pulled his troops from Iraq.
Most common Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as Foreign Affairs Minister, allowed the IS to rebel and fail to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to put fire on the media around him for pushing his word and being taken up against him.
He laughed at “the poor, pathetic” television scholars who tried to understand him, and said, “It will not prove!”
Several Democrats have gone wrong with Trump's apology with the fact that it's just another proof that it's not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop was pushed out of the price market. Now it's back in Greenpoint
Cafe Verb Cafe was a deceptive place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it occurred that she was pushed from the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that replaced Verb in summer 2014 - sells cake soap.
The locals were the last to lose a growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the hotel Chelsea is left out, and from Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscoverion.
The resurrect Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay to move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things behind.
Verb still has the same supplier of pastries and bought the same model for espresso.
He even re-used the lights from old Verbu.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
In the menu are sandwiches with ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find brown rice bowls here.
The coffee shop is no longer serving beer, but offering you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant inflow of the original shamgasts.
“A number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move out for prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of these customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and moved to Verb Cafe often.
Even then, when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when the Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I love is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she put another new one of her usual ice coffees in her usual ice cream.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been going to Verbu since 2003.
It goes before work, and it always orders the same thing.
"Four and eight here every day, like a watch, I come and they're ready for me with all and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets all the bacon, eggs and ham on his swing.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that Soap Cherie's owners offered him a special soap for Verb and as an ingredient, they use filtered coffee from the coffee shop.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint of the cafe also accepted well.
One of the new customers translated into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to build it soon to make his new neighbors feel like home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juice wants to stand in a bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the coffee shop to spread to a neighbouring building.
A lot of customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop reopens, enter and have coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
A depressing meal from the times of the crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The boulder of President Roosevelt enjoyed some of the selected dishes of the 5th Avenue, such as a bag made of goose livers and a Moravian turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs in a devil's way in a tomato sauce, potato pyré and as dessert of plum pudding.
"It was an act of chefial solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message to the Americans how to eat. ”
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is dedicated to the gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in his book “97 Orchard, ” tells the life story of a residential house on Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which was published on Tuesday by Harper, is history of American cuisine during a major economic crisis.
They showed themselves a chef's solidarity and the reporter gathered for dinner in Eisenberg's store with sandwiches, a small sharp buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with culprits of olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbatette, which, according to a few, was excellent for an interview about food during the crisis.
"Miss Ziegelman was very popular," she said.
He was selling peanuts, liver and beans.
They were made from this suburb and other cheap foods that the ingredients have set up.
Stop the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe got hurt.
"They would be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet breakfast, as you dream.
Teams of women cooked for workers from the farm and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served freshly cooked pie.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "And Square Meal" watching the way the nation was dealing with the fact that suddenly it was not a land of abundance.
“It was the time when the food became a central, concerned point for the American people,” said Coe on an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
In the same way, the new budgetary diet was expanded: mysterious foods, such as carbats and food from castres, castres as a “a great way to use the rest,” noted Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide non-esthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - after years of the central point of the American food - has become a economically allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures that were intended to serve as calorie and nutrition supplements were preferred to taste or even sound reason when cooking.
During the surveys for the book that contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared daily food from baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a favorite addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman pointed out: “It was surreal.
The peanut butter with a roasted onion can't be combined.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the serial of the Federal Bureau for the Economy between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the food habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, calling on women to take over the weights of the budget, and slenders, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots, to switch to tasteful meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Above all, the desserts were created in response to the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'll have pie".
While he publicly praised the simple Irish farmers' kitchen of his childhood, he was a chosen millionaire who had become.
“Rád ate continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate a tux in a almost lavish room.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him walk through his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the fact that the White House “not only served the most articulated meal in all of Washington, but also the most unhappily prepared way.”
Many dietary habits from the times of the crisis were heard as soon as the country re-emergenced.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple say that during writing the book, they better understand Miss Ziegelman's mother's diet habits - maybe why she couldn't throw out the food.
“She had real fear of waste of food,” Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people were wrong about her. ”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg, she and Mr Coe pulled the dessert that they prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a bit of flour, sugar, water, and nuts.
Everyone was eager to put a spoon in dense brown matter.
Surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe did, and then again.
And as a proper housekeeper, he said to his wife: "It would be a bit of a skank-ass."
Europeans: Migrants go for doses.
Most refugees who are fighting for Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to pay legal representation expenses in the case of a patent against a type C lute against a Merck company
The Court of First Instance held that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to pay the fees for lawyers which it has incurred in a process concerning the type C lute patent against the manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc medicines.
In June, the judgment in which Gilead was to pay 200 million for damage due to the violation of two Merck patents in connection with very successful Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni’s drug, after the federal judge found repeatedly illegal negotiations on Merck’s side, apart from other oaths and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the charges incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the new generation drug market against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merce sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active drug component from Gilead.
Americans supported by military forces claim to have obtained full control over the city of Manbaj
Military units supported by the United States have received full control over the northern town of Manbídž near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic state fighters fled the city, said on Friday the spokesperson of the group.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) now pave the city after leaving the rest of the radical group that hid in the city.
The troops freed over 2,000 civilians that the radicals held, said to Reuters Sharpan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbez military council.
"The city is under our control now, but we are still searching for it," said Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which stated that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had revenue of $10.75 million in that year and had a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, they spent $1 million on charity, mainly in the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation). The ex-President Bill Clinton contributed almost $3.3 million to the joint money by the honorary amount of CZK 5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign minister admitted a income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster’s publisher for her book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's roommate, American Senator Tim Caine, Virginia, and their wife, Anne Holton, have published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20,3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax return will be made public.
It is customary for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman in New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. tax department's Department of Finance as a reason for refusing his tax return to be published.
"Your move," said the branch member of Hillary Clinton's Twitter campaign and set up a tax confession for a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Special Trump's counselor, told CNN Thursday that Trump wouldn't let his tax return be published until the audits were over.
According to Trump's critics, among whom the Republican candidate for President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republic agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, commercial transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton, on the issue, has been very successful, and has published a video on Friday, which reminds us how high the Republican position on Trumpa is ordered to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, the question will be mentioned in its speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates have done to the presidential office for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said to the people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the journalist New York Times quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim to be, it can be the case at present.
The rates of federal taxes have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the millionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all who earn more than $1 million per year pay a tax of at least 30 per year.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet invited Trumpa to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffy said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump was "or" by the Financial Office, but by the voters.
Clinton's campaign published a return tax return until 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average between 2007 and 2014, paid a 32 percent federal tax on average and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, pay only $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which they gave Clinton income to dividends and amounts of $109 000.

Condoms filled with chilli or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings - throws condoms filled with chilli powder.
This procedure has been proven and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organisation The Nature Conservance, promotes and train volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzan, how by means of this nonviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many used copies earlier in their defense.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they have developed this... set of tools, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in a statement.
The first and second step is on the passing elephant to shine the battery and start the horn.
If it doesn't turn him away, the so-called "chilli flash" will be fired.
The chilli powder mixed with salt and the pellet will wrap into a condom, its end binds in such a way that only a knot is seen.
After the fire, the condom will explode and a fine chilly powder will be scattered into the air.
Most of the time, one slender is enough, and the elephant is going to go in a different direction.
The final option is to set off a fireworks that causes a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish director leaned to Berlin's hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to the “cash” of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin has triggered a riot in the media after he found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the words of the employee on the basis of an Arab clients' request.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary film on the Shoah Holocaust, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German FAZ daily.
During his recent stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call list.
However, the state has not been indicated between countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel, was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers a call to Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation, and with the problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer Lanzmann received, according to his word, was "crypt."
The hotel’s employee replied that the measures were “decided after considering Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this step was even more aroused.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the call code of Israel be erased,” quoted Lanzmann’s employees in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung Ambassador to Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as a “great shame”.
We were scared and shocked.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this occurred in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the correct conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong reaction online, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply “deprived” in the requirements of Arab customers.
“Hanba you,” states in a different contribution, which points to the fact that the hotel, located in Kurfurstendam’s noble street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel himself, the hotel quickly dropped any charges by calling the event “respecting” and Lanzman“ apologized.
“It has never been issued a direct command” not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the code for calling has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projects against protesting Brazilian students
There was a conflict between students and the police in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against protesters used tear gas and rubber designs.
The problem occurred when government order service tried to unravel students, which ended with police using rubber designs and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmina in order to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the transfer of 300 000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were able to see their writings sprayed on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators went to the streets to support President Dilmy Rousseff's seat when the Senate in the country decided to sue for it.
The trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan increased by 70.9% after the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $ 856 million.
In particular, Russia’s export to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The jumper increase in trade ensured the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travels.
In addition, Iran first reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I personally recommend visiting Isphahan, Shiraz and Yazz, where there are in good condition preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner is rushing home after the British got gold in the cycle
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the male team sprint on the Velodrom in Riu when the trio team VB defended the title from London 2012.
The three-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend pleased when he came to the goal and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth on the world championship in the track cycle in March, even though Hoy finished his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized opening racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes just showed up in time.
The place that tried to fill Kian Emma and Matt Crampton was also released after Hoye's departure.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was together with Hoy champion four years ago - and Skinner reached an Olympic record in qualifying, but he took over the T-shirt in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team's sprint.
Hindes was a little behind his bike, but Kenny's team pushed forward, and Skinner kept the lead.
The strategy change was a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to maintain the pace.
Hoy's race followed the BBC commentator's position and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes got up on stage, he didn't let his eyes out of them.
A three - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he fell on the track on a low start.
The note later downloaded back and the rivals in Britain had no way to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “I felt like London with all those British flags on the stands. ”
In the last three months, we've all been like a team.
We lost in many world races, so once again winning the Olympics is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a success of five days awaits us.
In the form that Kenny demonstrated, it is not inconceivable that Hoy's success would be repeated and three gold medals at the same time won at the Olympics.
That would be for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy for the day, also has a birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be for British sacred sport, also for Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Just as much as Hoy got.
As next, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts for the next three days.
The eight - year - old parent in Bolton said: “I am now enjoying this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight title. ”
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest to run a team on four kilometers.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held on the second day of the race, which will be focused on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualification contest, he debated with the Commissioner when the referee called on him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women continuing and ending tomorrow, Laura Trottová, Joanna Rowsell Shandová, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia reached a world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team has fallen on its powerful team of cycling and controlled the middle period of Olympic Games and has won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving the absolute predominance in Beijing and London, the preparations for Rio’s expectations decreased.
There were dramatic events in the background, last but not least, the withdrawal of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations against sexism and discrimination, and the end of careers of the greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the races on the welodrom shows, it seems legendary reputations that the team of Great Britain is able to submit a top performance with perfect timing, it could be confirmed again.
Uncertainty future of the truck in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium tank in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power supply plant that has been supplied by the company and which has informed of the intention of one of the owners of the power supply contract.
This step takes place after the Government of Victoria had decided earlier this year that it would not extend the provision of subsidies maintained by the undertaking.
The validity of a fixed 20-year-old subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at the Alcoa Portland company.
Up to 2000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, may be at risk when closing.
And since the factory consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's factory in 2014, which led to the closure of Anglesea's power plant last year.
Alcoa's factory in Portland is prolific and threatens to close.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the production prices of the plant.
AGL, which has been supplied by the power plant from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, declared that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
Alcoa and Alumina, the majority owner of the plant, are small business interests held by the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portuguese plant to continue operating, in other words, that the challenge of electricity demand from the rolling stock will continue," she said.
AGL stated that contracts are the so-called ‘insure contracts’ which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL still assumes that contracts will participate in profit for fiscal year 2017’, declared the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to a strong outlook on the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of contracts in accordance with its accounting books of $ 187 million “in case of completion.”
Alcoa stated that the contract decision to end ‘is not an impact on its ... ability to operate a trailer or to secure the supply of electricity to a trailer’.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years to start paying from November of this year, although it still had to explain why it had resigned.
Analysts are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the Portland rolling stock in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
Head of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawattts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawattts each year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real estate TV show Kardashian - is now the cover of the light Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of mother-manier clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner appeared on the front page of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador to Estee Lauder, who presented the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, ” Kendall wrote to me when I look at this front page.
The discovery of the title page followed by a bizarre (or simply continuation of humor in Kardashian's submission?) an inspired video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar breakers Rob and Caitly and along with them all of their favorite chasms uncles, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sister, they forgot only so that the scene could end with a classic turnover: they prepare a secret party.
It's an obese storyline of almost every "birthful" part of a baby TV show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we've forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a drawing rabbit on the show at 8:00am), but Kris needed to make sure that other girls in this audience could live.
Because if we look at Vogue's bright magazine number, we definitely entered the new era of Cardashian.
Sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the bright edition of the magazine is another league.
Vogue magazine's shining edition is the most sold number of the year.
The release, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, is attracted to a number of advertisers (Fashionist estimated that from 832 pages in last year's edition, 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so there is no wonder that in the past two years pictures of the magazine have escaped before his official publication.
Women who have appeared in the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly appeared more “creatures that make models” than “models that are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's holder and Dior ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, and a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is highly unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as her generation’s “folk model” - falls into the first category, will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, neither stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make well-stranged video (even if Jenner represents all this).
They're provenly talented women who exist in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of Lemonade albums.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymorová, the original Victoria's Secret model criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, and she called them "kits of the moment".
These feelings burned again with news about Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner is on Vogue's cover.
He's a supermodel in the right word.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their own chauffeurs.
She's selling photos to Cindy Crawford's daughter, who took pictures for the LOVE magazine.
And in leisure moments, he's acting on a reality show, maybe just like one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal assistance centres reject 160 000 people annually
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the Community legal assistance centres, and in the sector themselves they are preparing for the impact that will have further restrictions on the funding of an already over-increasing service.
In Queenslda, three of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, threats to workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair eviction and so on - are rejections at a time when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tightly linked to cracking, are prepared for further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal assistance centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
According to the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said the situation would get worse without canceling the federal government's decision.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronicly funded, which means that thousands of people are rejected by vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 percent, leading to the need for further thousands of vulnerable people from Queens to be aware of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the U.S. Attorney and Senator Queenslda George Brandise to prevent this shortfall of finances from getting the help they need when they get into legal problems.
Over the past year, the government has maintained its commitment to secure the financing of legal aid up to the level of the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the Community legal assistance centres and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Request for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the staff reportedly directed the weapon
New York: Donald Trumpa's campaign was filed for an alleged impropriety after being told that the head of operations in North Carolina in February directed a weapon to a staff member while driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in the court file, which, on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte, handed over Vincent Bordini, a former state software trainer in the campaign.
Bordini said he was expecting months to solve the situation internally before he concluded that "this would not happen".
Director Earl Phillip “marked his fingers with a gun, gave a true pointer on the trigger and directed the barrel to Vincent on his jaw”, said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini's complaints at the local and regional campaign management revealed that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“The weapons don’t have to fire to cause damage,” said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the President provoked an abstinence when the voters in North Carolina said that they could step up the owners and arms holders (which is modified in the US in the second amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and would be able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump didn't defend violence.
Bordins in the lawsuit ask for compensation to be paid for their careless oversights and from Phillip for jeopardy of personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not react immediately.
The attempts to get comments from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local intelligence branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip left the campaign a while ago.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not responded in a short period of time.
Republican candidate for President Donald Trump leads the controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be the source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just like London 2012, when we developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities we will create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs, and we will end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just as before the London Olympics in 2012 there will be those who will think that the Heathrow extension is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in Heathrow it turns out they weren't right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question concerning it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure in which many people and companies are involved, not only a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of £ 211 billion, to leave a legacy in the form of skills and jobs both in the vicinity of the airport and in the whole of Great Britain.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which in the term and budget introduced the infrastructure investment programme for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected the best terminal in the world five years behind, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most busy early in the world.
Now they're ready to deliver a third of the ranch, worth £16 billion of private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic Games and to extend Heathrow, to secure trade in the future and to leave the heritage of skills and employment on which Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Director for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From the attempts to bypass advertising blocking programs, it became a game on cat and mouse on online marketing for companies. At least this is claimed by one of the companies that programme such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it will block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a post in which users can update the filters in their program and again block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that his desktop website will change encoding around advertising to make it more complex for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already gone over.
The spokesperson of the Addlock Ben Williams in the blog wrote that “this sort of war between the open source of advertising blocking community and those trying to bypass them lasts since the blocking of advertising was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another own repair.
The fact that the company possessing the greatest social network in the world has been involved in the war just shows how much the problem of blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe performed the tker last year, worldwide advertising filters of around 200 million people - almost four times than it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits of advertising on Facebook, Facebook from mobile devices every day will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The spokesperson said that the company was going against advertising filters on desktops, because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social networks and Instagram are not working.
Companies on desktops still represent profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preference setting" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how advertising is shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters concern them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising on the site.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” said the spokesperson Facebook in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Prreferences, which will control people.
A woman hit a Swiss highway car
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnessing an event in which a woman who was probably tried to commit suicide on the highway on Thursday morning.
There was an accident on the A1 motorway near Morges at the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police in the statement said that the actor “fare action” was lying in the dark on the road and ran it over several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the scene.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, they have still not been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all the others who have witnessed accidents to make themselves known.
Criminal investigation, a "logistic" step in a situation like this, has been launched, said to Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether one of the drivers involved will face any accusations.
Was it possible to stop the impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a walker who was crossing the highway in the middle of the night as the newspapers said.
Last year, the police officer was deprived of the charge for murder from negligence after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne at night in August 2014.
In court, the victim at the age of 22 had a drink of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court found that police officers - who responded to an emergency call - were driving in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the quarterly incident that occurred at Morges should log in to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
It's a total city.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The association of Czech travel agencies and agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague in Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková communicated it.
The sixth year Prague Pride started on August 8th, the festival brings closer the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended the event last year.
"Praha belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises", said Petříčková.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend on average 3100 crowns per person per day on average.
Gay tourists are in support of their travel available special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientela is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price lines with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held in the festival program this year.
It presents experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also address several thematic areas that are family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
On Saturday the festival will be the traditional tour with allegorical cars that will go from Václavské náměstí to Letná.
The guide, which thousands of people attended in recent years, this year honors a minute's silence of the memory of the victims of June's attack in the Night Club in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate forty years.
The invulnerable cockroach Pat and Matt, whose efforts have usually ended in disaster, have been enjoying small and large viewers forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomír Benes was premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known by viewers in more than hundreds of countries, was the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Benes, which he was thinking for a magazine with two cocks of masters Ouholič and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturgist Jiří Kubíčka and the artist Vladimir Jiránek and jointly produced a film by Kuťác.
Today's form with yellow and red trick and ball and radio got characters in 1979, when a TV series for Slovakia began in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat then got the ponies in 1985, this time they were filming already for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Benecko founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where more parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works were continued with other creators, many of whom was involved by the son of Benes.
Currently, there are over 90 episodes with stories of these things, which all come down under their hands, but they never get mad at each other, and they are always filled with optimism, ideas and Kutilian enthusiasm, and eventually they are satisfied with their work, which will prove to be a known gesture "and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, to DVD and figures or other toys with Pat and Mat's imagery are the hit of every toy shop.
A story for Fiji and for the two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is in a sign of fairy tales, we picked for you one sport and one of our lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved an historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what kind of things do people spend most on airports?
That's a Friday tour of the world's websites.
First medal from Olympic Games.
The historic success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's choice of this island beat the team of Great Britain in the finals of the Olympics tournament of the seven-legged ragby.
It's the first medal that Fiji won at the Olympics for herself.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted 60 years since sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji brings great credit for success.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been running from 2013 onwards, and after the finale as a British citizen, he could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," said the coach in front of the finals.
The Fiji finally had it sovereignly, and a small state with 900 000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Ros Ivy Allen, who has been living without her hands and feet for 11 months, has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," she rejoiced with a two-year-old girl who betrayed her mother for ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to take her arms and legs off, and then she sat together without a denture.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of life, and doctors gave her only ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she's never giving up.
He's got a perspective.
I saw her representing the other kids with words Hi, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have my hands, I delivered my mother.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend most on at the airport?
CNN brings in a finding that people at the airports spend most on packed water.
The Hudson's Travel essential store has published the data in the last year, which summarizes 10 products that customers buy at its airport shops most often.
The water was sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who's closing down the first ten?
You can't eat as one of the above things.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Week, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereign.
We're just going to win, laughing at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have successfully reigned the category of doubles without a steering wheel for seven years and have confirmed their dominance in the Olympics in Riu de Janeiro.
At first sight, the unnatural couples have gone to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics, and competition has been shrunk since 2009.
Rodriga de Freitas in the fourth finals added 69th prizes in a row.
What are we different from others?
We are just nicer, funny Murray already during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than others.
We're just training hard, you know, hard.
And we are constantly trying to improve our technique, that is our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their control is remarkable even because they are physically different.
Murray's almost two-foot and a sidekick, a academicly looking at Bond is five inches smaller and 15 pounds lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and dedicated to finance; Murray has, for example, a charity boxer game.
Even though he doesn't spend too much time hanging out with him.
Eric's entering the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, demonstrated in his opinion that Murray's dominant in the crew.
He's always answered first, and Bond's been waiting for his opportunity.
However, it destroys rivals with a calm force on the water.
They're going at their pace, and although often they're not in the middle of the line, the opponents haven't found a prescription on their gradual acceleration.
We're going on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to drive the first mile up.
We're just trying to move on to a pace that no one else can.
We know what we need to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four years younger, he won seven gold medals at World Cup.
They even triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a control room.
Just after an unexpected failure of a larger crew at Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move into a pair without a steering wheel.
At the London Olympics, apparently, the biggest defeat of their careers was taken away and the dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was gonna be fucking hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, said Murray.
We all know they want us off the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once resident
According to the projection of the new climate model NASA, Venus was once present.
In Goddard's NASA Institute, scientists developed a model for the study of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate research scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and throughsaturated CO2, could have conditions similar to that on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus seems to have once been proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the earth, while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was likely to have been dryer than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and to provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had also used the Sun, which was 30 percent more interpreting.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, the daily side of the sun is almost two months at a time,” explained the scientist from the GISS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
Thus, the surface heat and rain are heated, which creates the density of the layer of clouds that are treated as umbrellas and the surface is evaporated from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model has compiled the story of Venus, similar to the evolution that the previously hypothetically compiled planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans were evaporated and water pairs were burned in ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped and there is only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- this is Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his position as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team as a reason why he was unable to participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
The Executive Vice President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years I served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
I've been thinking long and intensively over the years how I can improve the team, give him the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who was accepted by Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team’s benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013.
He made a team profit of 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. But Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and in the last two years, he never had a match after the season.
Avalanche team reached score 39:39:4 in 2015/2016 and lacked five points to get the second wild card at the Western conference.
The owner of Roy, who signed into the Hall of Glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Plant workers in the North Sea restore conversations and interrupt strike
The leaders of the parties acting said that the strikes for the Northern Sea oil platform workers were interrupted while all parties of the dispute were gathered for a new round of negotiations.
At the strike against the company of services for the Wood Group sporadically arrived on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Unite Trade Organisations and RMTs may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for the resolution of current non-conformities,’ is set out in the statement.
Starting next week, we will have a number of full-day meetings during the coming few weeks where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which was the first one in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced the rates this year and paid 9 percent less to its suppliers in the North Sea due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with a solution to the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell cut thousands of people's billing notes and announced plans to leave operations in the field of oil and natural gas in 10 countries for the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, the Member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders to discuss one of the greatest work failures of the generation, which led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need a economy that works for everyone, not only for some," he said.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly 1.4 billion dollars of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average over the past five years was about 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Plejada
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get almost a complete list of speeding stars from the Plejáda starship.
New data help astronomers understand why stars in the starshop are turning at various speeds, as well as how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope to learn more about the relationship between starships, its old age and even history in its solar system,” said Luis Rebullová, a researcher in the centre of Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Plejada Starship is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching a state of adulthood and have been created for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning fast.
In the eyes of the maximum speed of rotation, these teen stars release an enormous amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the way the star gets older, her speed of turning slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star so that it measures time between discovering distinctive points on the stars -- similar to sunlight.
According to latest data on rotation speeds, bigger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebully compares the stars to dancers, the bigger they make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the “packet” We see that the slower rolling stars are more massive, while those that spin fast are usually very light stars,” Rebulla said.
Because the Starshop is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of stars and speed of rotation.
“The polls provide us with anchor for the theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars,” Rebully said.
There's still a lot of things we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their speed of turning and so saying, "she'll hang her dance shoes to her nails."
Rebully and her colleagues have described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Plejad in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal magazine.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I hadn't applied, then the qualifier agreement wouldn't have been concluded, and after a few months I could have gone to another hospital?
Is it possible to work without enrolling in specialization education?
My point is that in the field where I want to work, there is now a job only in a somewhat distant hospital, but in about six months, a place in which I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about half a year, but it's going to be a question.
It's a match to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation lays down an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - by hospitals.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the staff member and the employer in order to ensure the return of the incurred costs related to the increase or deepening of the qualifications of the staff member.
In the field of health, the long-term pressure on the failure to conclude these agreements, with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll. on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional competence and specialised competence to carry out medical professions of a physician, a dentist and a pharmacist, which explicitly states that participation in specialisation training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not as an increase).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to apply to specialisation education.
The law only lays down the conditions for an application for specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out the appointment of a doctor by already attending the required university study, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a physician with specialised competence in the relevant field).
The law predicts the situation where a physician may be included in specialised education in another field of specialisation if its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know any closer circumstances of this case, it is possible to recommend consultation with the competent department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Occupations), since the Ministry of Health of the Law provides advisory and consulting services related to the inclusion and conduct of specialization education.
The advisory service also provides the Czech Medical Chamber free of charge, each member of which must be a doctor.
The Syrian Halab doctors are asking for an intervention from the United States.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (the insurgent part of the city by government forces), and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House of AFP.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a flightless zone over the eastern Havlab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that the Hague will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russia’s forces, supported by the army of faithful President Bashar Assad, have announced that it will stop every day for three hours from now in the area of Halab to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
All military activities, air attacks and artillery fires are to be stopped from 9:00 to 12:00.
While UN Chief of humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, he stressed that at least two days are needed.
According to AFP, 15 out of 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab have already been converted to the letter.
He says that during the five-year war, they witnessed violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and states how complex Syria is, but it does not do enough to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly focused threats, infected with peers, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said that over the past month 42 attacks have been recorded on medical devices in Syria, 15 of which have been working at hospitals.
Most sad of all is the fact that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Small children are coming to the E.R. with such serious injuries that we must choose between them who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, to describe the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four babies were strangled when the explosion interrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They lay in their breath, and then their lives ended -- before he could really start, they reminded.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, supported by Russian forces, surrounded the rebels in the eastern part of Halaba last week, inside it was found without food supply of more than 200,000 people.
The rebels, under constant blows of Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break through on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides were then added to the city and its surroundings by reinforcements.
