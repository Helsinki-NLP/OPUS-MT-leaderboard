Bosnia and Herzegovina protest against Croatia's plans for radioactive waste storage
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the north-west of Bosnia in the protest against the neighbouring plans of Croatia concerning the storage of part of waste from the only part of the nuclear plant region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known from natural beauty.
The demonstrators in Bośniacki town of Novi Grad demanded that Croatia reject its plans to build waste storage in the former military rites in Trgovska Gora and declared war against the project.
Waste from the Krško nuclear power plant would be stored in the facility.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (the river) Una needs us", said that the radioactive waste storage site could threaten the Union and the lives of some 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drlja, Mayor of the municipality of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Uny.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also located in Croatia.
The representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional waste disposals.
On Friday, Croatia’s public television TV provided that it was not yet decided whether to build the waste storage itself or to pay for the storage of parts of waste in a new facility designed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from each side of the country of ethnic division insisted that Croatia find a different location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why does Croatia in all its territory say that the Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?” he asked Drlja.
We can't let them down!

American Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 aircraft F-35
The U.S. Congress for 15 days after the Department of State’s approval of possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-tasting fighters F-35 has not objected to this transaction, which means that the last condition has been met before the negotiations began.
The decision of Congress, although not expected, is of great political importance.
"After the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Defence Councillor of the Washington Conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Law on the Export Control of Broni from 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of weapons abroad for 15 days before the signing of the agreement, if the value of such a transaction, in case of the sale of weapons to the NATO State, exceeds 50 million mines.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion bucks. This amount includes the cost of technical and logistics assistance, support equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of aircraft F-35 – if the transaction is finally completed – will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for the fighters of the F-35A company Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for purchasing the fifth generation F-35 US fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities submitted Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
Poland's offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Duda with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon in the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot Anti-Troak system.
The price of one fighter F-35 at the time of Poland's offer of purchase was – without weapons and technical assistance – approximately 89,2 million mines.
According to PAP, American military experts who wanted to remain anonymous were the price given in the preliminary negotiations "the maximum price was much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices fall rapidly, the current price of one F-35 is less than 80 million mines, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, which has no advantage of F-35", indicated Venable.
PAP speakers have expressed their hope that the final negotiations of the transaction on the purchase by Poland of American combat aircraft will be completed this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – or offset – will be discussed directly with the US fighters of F-35.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I think Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have the chance to win elections with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Simmoniak.
Deputy Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in his talks with Poland News spoke about the offer with the head of NIK.
‘This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He may become Minister of Culture for some entertainment, not the head of the NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious crisis of the country," he added.
Simmoniak also talked about Klauudi Jachira's candidate.
‘The letters of PiS are Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who wasn't just saying things, he was just doing them.
He judged the former SKW heads of espionage to Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal to Antoni Macirewicz not being on the letters?" he asked.
“The younger ones have other aesthetics from us.
I think Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, too, feels that she is sometimes exaggerating.
Let's not make this a campaign issue," he added.

"Occupious" masked rapist of the children of Central Coast forced to look at their victim in court
Dressed in a masked man's outfit, he grabbed a 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into a dense village in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Soon after arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers kept a number of important cases to investigate.

When she begged her to “stop, stop, stop, stop,” he grabbed her behind her neck and forced her to enter the girdle.
The man said: “Cicho, do not scream.
Don't yell because I'm gonna have to hurt you."

The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executives of technological companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievements poses a risk of increasing social inequalities if, in its context, ethics does not take into account the good in common.
Pope Francis wrote these words at a conference in Vatican, where governments and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics participated.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered the participants at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
There were technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work in which the machines will become more and more important, as well as a study of the case of a bombing research in Christcharch in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies owned by social media owners in connection with the spread of a recording massacre film.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noticeing that, thanks to the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers were saved from dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasingly dependent on robot devices in order to make profits is the risk of depriving people of dignity from work.
"If technological progress were the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, this progress would not be real and real," he warned.
If so-called technological progress of humanity would become an enemy of good in common, it would lead to an undesirable reversing of some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference organizers expressed their hopes to benefit from the expertise of participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church in high technology matters.
Martin Odegaard, a rental player from Real Madrid, is a fan in euphoria with his powerful asist.
Martin Odegaard noted an impressive asusta when he opened the goal of Mikela Oyarrabal.
Wins 2-0 with Osauna, Real Madrid climbed to the summit of La League and continues the pass of being disturbed on his own field this season.
However, despite the absence of one failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under great pressure as a result of a turbulent pre-seson period and a public argument with the Welsh star, Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the League of Masters by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talent at their disposal – some of them now have plans to do so, not to others.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the band.
However, this Norwegian young player, Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to the Real Sociedad, caused a great move, including the incredible assist in the La League game.
During the meeting, Real Sociedad of Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist at the opening goal of Mikela Oyarzabala and Real Sociedad ultimately won 3:0 before his own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right hand side, Martin Odegaard manipulated the player from the opposite team, setting him up with a grid, and then sent him an incredible pass to the centimeter between two other players and his teammate was left to add a leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third in the execution of the incredible Oyarrabal, this time with a penalty shot, provided a decisive Imanola care victory before Man Garcia was sent from the field five minutes before the end of the game.
Martin Odegaard joined the Reala Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet fan expectations.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel like he's on the field.

Anna Hazare said: “The name of Sharad Pawar was not seen on the list when I was sent to this matter. ”
Social worker, Anna Hazare, has not been surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar – President of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP – appeared in connection with multi-million fraud in the State Cooperative Bank Maharashtra.
The Agency of the Executive Director, in short ED, brought a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar – former Deputy Minister of State of Maharashtra, and others in connection with fraud.
The Executive Director's information report on the case, the equivalent of the FIR police report, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Law on Anti-laundering Money.
The case is based on the FIR report of the Mumbai police, which listed the names of the former bank president Ajita Pawara and 70 former staff of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar was nowhere to be seen.
“The way his name came out, who gave it, only they know these things” said Anna Hazare on Thursday, when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged connection of Sharad Pawar with fraud.
Anna Hazare, critically judging by Sharad Pawar, expressed his hope that the truth would come to light as a result of a detailed investigation into fraud by the ED.
"ED finds out where his name came from" said Anna Hazare, a multiple member of the manifesto against corruption.
Sharad Pawar denies the admission of a criminal act and claims that it was in no way linked to the bank, as well as raises the question that the matter was filed several weeks before the 21st October of the Maharast Assembly elections.
Former Minister of the Union has assured that he will not be able to refer clearly to the central government of the BJP.

Cataclysms, severe illness, the death of a child.

The crimes you committed speak for yourself.
The murder of two children.
Trying to kill four kids and a whole deal to take them out of their lives.
I am practically convinced that each one of you will be sentenced to several times punishment for life's imprisonment."
It's the judge to determine whether this will be a penalty for absolute imprisonment without parole.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisor in connection with the nearby business relationship with Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office on the Political Procedure of IOPC will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation before the prime minister whether fraud being criminal has been committed during the conduct of the public office as mayor of London.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated that its supervisory officer registered the "contribution-related question" of the Prime Minister in connection with the accusations on the preferential treatment of Arcuri, which were due to a link between their close friends.
"About the "action-related question" can be said when there are information showing the possibility of a crime," he said.
This does not mean that somehow they proved it.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this case.
The question is addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
It was referred to this police supervisor because Johnson was the equivalent of the police and criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied the fact that there were no irregularities related to his nearby relationship with Arcuri.
He had said that he would apply to the London City Council command and give details of his relations with Arcuri, but he insisted that the council "studys on the wrong problem".
The evidence follows the report "The Sunday Times" that Arcuri, an American, who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 from budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which was headed by Mayor Johnson at that time.
As a result, the government's report, until the case is examined, has frozen a subsidy of £ 100,000 in favour of Arcuri's Hacker House company.
The government expects troublesome questions about the verification procedure before granting the funds.
Mr Matt Warman said in the House of Gmin that the employees of his department “normally preserved due diligence” and that the company had a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the calls to the number were redirected to the office in California, where he is currently home to 34-year-old Arcuri.
The close relationship between the Prime Minister and the Businesswoman, "was a police officer's secret for the staff."
The GLA's decision to refer the Prime Minister's case to an independent IOPC police office was disgruntled at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source from the higher rank, the government representative is a ‘political attack’ and its deadline is ‘politically motivated’ on the eve of the Conference of the Conservative Party’.
"The Supervisory Inspector did not provide any evidence of any allegations and the Prime Minister did not get the opportunity to reply to him before the press release last night" said the source.
Neither citizens nor the media can get on such a conspicuous political bill.
In earlier hours, the newspaper "The Standard" said that the close relationship between Johnson and his businessmate from California, which was supported by the agency for tourism and promotion in London, was "a secret of the police".
London & Partners (L&P) employees were given the above mentioned that Arcuri had received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her companies were then not considered ‘wildible’.
Third person accused of drug crime in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In connection with the recent death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to the judicial records, Stephen Walter is suspected to sell fake oxycodone pills made by fentanyl, which Miller held before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, the strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which absorbed a few thousand lives in the United States.
Walter's accused of delivering the pills that another man Cameron Pettit sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed off on Tuesday reveal that Petit received drugs from Walter all over August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week at Lake Havas City, Arizona, suspected to play the role of Walter's "currier" who delivered Pettit pills.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor had any of them presented a line of defence in his case.
Walter, subject to parole on the 2005 drug case, is in custody, and in addition, he has already been sentenced to five months for infringement of the terms of release.
The complainants in charge of the case, which was the first to report on the TMZ Celebrate website on Thursday, demand Walter remain in custody pending the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape of the defendant.
The answer to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged with a federal court on September 4th, and his defender refused a comment.
The words of Miller’s reputable works are a genuine conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was really called Malcolm James Myers McCormick for two years, remained in connection with Ariana Grande's song finished earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next" in which she talks about him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been associated in recent years with the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the band 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone in his body was found.
This article introduces a change: Walter's correct writing is "Stephen", not "Sven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
9-year-old creates a game of type playing in a hidden game using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far Basil has generated more than 30 mobile games.
In today's game, there is a bat who hides according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a bat that comes out of the safe.
I learned how to make games on an accelerated course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote it down for a five-day accelerated course for children aged between 5 and 15.
The course, organized by the Codefest International, was intended to provide children such as Basel, access to new technologies such as robots and virtual reality.
Father of the boy, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“ When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always caught the phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run", CNN's father said.
But Basel’s interest in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and received a storm for spending all his time on the game.
"One day he played on the board as usual, and he was so excited that I was upset," said his father.
I said, "You're just playing hard, or can't you think about creating your own games so they can play other games?"
In saying these words, I was upset and I didn't think he'd take it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown interest in learning to create his own games, he has led his parents to buy a laptop and write it into a course where he has learned the basis for creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his huge degree of content-based titles.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available at the Google play table.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently two Nigerian 12-year-olds were praised for using codes to create robots sharing their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the female high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots to co-operate boxes.
And thanks to growing investments of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on the right path to the career of the coding stars.
Former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina will admit lies about corruption
On Friday, court documents show that former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of the main political donor.
Robin Hayes says he's guilty on the next Wednesday.
From a document based on a real basis prepared in the context of a lawyer's settlement and signed by Hayes' lawyer, it appears that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI investigating corruption in 2018.
The lawyer's settlement has been sealed and, on the basis of the facts, there is no evidence that Hayes's allegations will come true.
At first, he was charged with a contract, corruption and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in the plan of the insurance company's plan to direct the campaign to the principal country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates have been charged with trying to buy Mike Causey's state insurance officer.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, being one of the major political donors in recent years, who has submitted more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also provided data to Democrats.
His lawyer did not reply to a Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
The Defense Officer Hayes Kearns Davis did not reply to the Friday e-mail request for comment.
From the documents submitted on Friday, it appears that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he hadn't talked to Causey about the state staff of the insurance department.
According to a document containing the real basis of Hayes, he was in fact speaking to the Commissioner for Insurance of Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg set up a meeting with Causey and talk about the bribe directly to the regulator.
According to Lindberg's April act of accusation, he required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to Causeya in 2020.
The contested act shows that the statement also made a request to amend the department's official who controlled Lindberg.
As Republican Causey reported a alleged attempt of corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence of the case.
He wasn't charged.
According to Lindberg's indictment, he ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to Causey during the talks, where Lindberg and Causey were present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such money would attract attention, but, as a result of the accusation, he eventually resolved.
"Whatever you all want to do is do it" – says Hayes according to the act of accusation.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The spokesperson of the Federal Prosecutor did not reply to the e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.

Facebook with care about the feel of users hides to try the face counter
In the first time in the world of experiment, which aims to improve users' well-being, some people who use Facebook will soon not see a counter of likeness, reactions and video views.
Likes will only be hidden and visible to the post author, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a study on well-being and an opinion from a mental health specialist indicating that a numerator might be inclined to compare with others.
“A lot of groups working with us on the fight against crackdown, as well as organisations in mental health were really positive,” said Garlick.
The elimination of this numerator will make people focus on the quality of their interaction and on the quality of their content rather than on the number of likeness or reaction.
It is expected that sharing with others via the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be viewed as competitive, said it.
Garlick ensured that companies based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they had access.
She said it was too early to be able to tell if the test would be extended to other countries, as it happened with Instagram, when the test covered by Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
"The initial comments of users on the new rules applicable to Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions" - she said.
Speaking about the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically recognized Facebook and Instagram users.
We think that this is an amazing country that will provide us with charming opinions showing whether new experience is valuable for those who use our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councilmen want compensation for the pilgrims
So far, the Częstochowska resort does not comment on the appeal of councillors to the Metropolitan Abpa Wacława Depo to provide financial compensation for the management of the waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city requests a PLN 1 from the pilgrimage.
He spoke of a press conference on Friday, including the leader of the Spring Robert Biedron, organized on the leading side of the Jasna Čečnoschowa Mountains, the Virgin Mary, vice-president of the City Council and candidate for Sejm Łukasz Kot.
The cat informed that the day before the city councillors SLD voted the appeal to Wacława Depo for the transfer of the city of one gold from any visitor of the Congregation – to support the work of urban, municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to the archbishop of Depo to help the city, to help us clean after the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
“We ask for a symbolic zloty to be transferred to the city’s budget from every pilgrimage.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions for their stay in Częstochowa", said Vice-President of the City Council.
The spokesperson of the Częstochowa resort of the Metropolitan Court of Fr Mariusz Bakalar initially prepared a several-day response, then asked – as he said, to replace it with information on the content: "We do not refer to the matter until we receive the official position of the city council".
According to the project on the pages of the Czech Magistrate, the appeal to the Debo abpa refers to the transfer of financial compensation to the Częstochowa city for the handling of municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season.
"In view of the growing number of frequent pilgrims coming to Częstochowa, and the increasing costs of handling the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, in view of the image of the city among the dwellings and inhabitants, birds and loops, we want a piece of appeal within the generally accepted canon of care for our common good, the small home of Częstochowa, to propose a participation in the costs of handling the waste system.
"In order to maintain the purity of pedestrian-trading tractors moving along with small infrastructure, i.e. external trash baskets, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in municipal waste management in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim," he wrote.
"In addition to participation in annual costs, which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the purity and aesthetics of the urban space, and wanting to stress that such cooperation will bring benefits to all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be used to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available", declared the councils.
They pointed out that, apart from the financial issues, their proposal stems from numerous reservations raised by citizens about the purity of the routes that pilgrims are moving.
"In view of the cleanliness of our city and the positive results of our cooperation, the Częstochowa Council calls for the archbishop of Częstochowa Wacława Depo to provide financial compensation to the Częstochowa city for the handling of municipal waste management systems during the pilgrimage season", has been repeated in the appeal.
According to information from Jasna Góra’s press office in the whole year in 200 national pilgrims involved 834 thousand people.
About 124 thousand faithful people arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrimages.
More than 8,8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Not a total of 20 people reached the sanctuary of the horse, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on rolls.
TVP’s “Widoms” have passed the Confederate on the survey
According to the Pollster study, 45% of the votes would be given to Sejm PiS, 26% KO, 14% left, PSL 7%, and Confederate 5%.
Even on the "Super Express" portal, for which the probe was performed.
The main issue of the "Widom" describes the same survey shows the results of only four first parties, completely beyond the Confederacy.
Edyt Lewandowska explicitly stressed that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
TVP's views have also been shown to share semblance mandates without taking account of the votes cast in the Confederate.
It would give PiS the governments themselves.
Krzysztof Bosak commented on the whole situation as a matter of "public compromise on the issue of honesty towards society".
“They started with a message about the “moral revolution””, he recalled and said that this matter was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that “The news of the TVP” in the next action against the Confederacy is embarrassing Urban and Michnik.”
He also pointed out the lack of correct journalists' reactions.
“ But let us also look at those who are kindly silent.
These "rights", "independent," "invincible".
In a few years, they became more primitive in the version of all that they were fighting with," he added.

Brother sentenced to life sentence for killing honorable stars of the social media Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star, was strangled in July 2016.
Qandeel Baloch's brother of Pakistan's social media was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to lifelong imprisonment for the most prominent of this patriarchal country's "martial murder".
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies, polite according to Western standards, but in highly mysoginal Pakistan, was considered provocative, was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no conscience for his actions and he said that he "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unapplicable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the court in the western town of Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-term judgment.
"Inshallah (if God will allow) will be removed by the court of the higher instance" - he said.
Previously, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP that she hoped her son would be exonerated.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son" - she said.
Baloch's murder has been led by the world's news service and has resumed the call for action against an outbreak of honor killings in which victims – usually women – are killed for breaking the patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, strangled, shot or scuttled for such accusations as choosing their own husband or, like Baloch, for bringing their family to shame through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Killings are usually done by a close relative.
According to Pakistan’s law, Qisas (the bloody money) and Diyat (even) may ask the nearest victims to forgive.
Three months after Baloch was murdered, the Parliament adopted new legislation introducing punishment for life-long prisons for honor killings.
However, whether murder will be considered an honorable crime remains in the hands of a judge, which means that murderers can theoretically rely on other motives and be guilty.
In the case of Baloch, her parents pressured their son not to show grace at all.
However, the cowards think that they might also lose their minds, change their minds, and declare that they want to be held guilty.
The international violence caused by the murder caused the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce itself as heir to the parents, thus making matters move forward.
One of Baloch's more known performances is to offer a striptease before the Pakistani Cricket team and the establishment of a decaled purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticised and threatened, but many young people, including young people, saw it as a breaking limit in the country in which the kim Kardashian position can be seen as a bold and political movement to strengthen women's position.
The root of a "honor" murder lies in tribal social standards, which continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular, standards the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from the north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN organization stated that the increasing violence caused, within the last four months, a double of the number of people displaced from the north-west of Nigeria to some 40,000 people.
The UN Refugees Agency stated that the concerns created by the "new exceptional humanitarian situation" which requires inter-agency efforts to meet by the end of the year new funds amounting to $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been up for decades, has not been responsible for recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian state of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of the activities of organised armed groups.
"This is a horrifying painting of anarchy and uncertainty" said the journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders and sexual assaults from attackers who also destroy houses and stolen cattle.
Army and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is taken away from the fight against Boko Haram and the decommitment of the Islamic State in West Africa, which was separated from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groups" - he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Most refugees move to neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that more people are expected to run to Nigeria in the coming months together with a worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for a man accused of killing a woman and 2 children.
A new date of trial was planned for a Guatemalan man accused of killing Iowa's apartment and her two children.
According to the caselaw of the Rejon General Court in Polk, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of three murders of the first degree under, as the authorities claim, a false name which originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he shot a 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The case law shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. on 27 January, will give both parties more time to prepare.
Imigration and Customs officials of the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally resident in the United States and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010 he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson, in the face of the rebellion of the office to reduce the demands of Brussels and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
For just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the world, the Prime Minister is concerned that it is not enough to gain more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of rebellion from an office that wants to reduce demands in connection with Brussels and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was an impasse on a new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Brussels has identified proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "irregular".
They expect EU decision-makers to be head of Germany's Angela Merkel to offer the criticised leader a compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the backstop mechanism.
The Journalist "The Sun" spoke with three different ministers of the office, from which everyone is preparing to confront with the Prime Minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will ask the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy drawn up by his close advisor Dominik Cummings, based on attempts to use the bluff against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without a contract and then accept the offer made by the Union at the last moment.
One of the ministers of the office identified the suspensive verdict of the Supreme Court in the event of the end of Parliament’s suspension as a “warrant signal” on Tuesday and added: “The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of a contract.
We will never defeat the Arithmetics in the House of Gmin, which runs on our own.
The Prime Minister must now bend and accept what is capable of receiving.
Aggression doesn't pay: it is obvious that the Cummings plan burned on the nail.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second Minister of Office has committed himself to hand over Johnson to try to push over the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May, if everything else is not true.
The minister said: "If I must, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-submit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in House."
The chances of her vote are numerous, and everything is very dependent on the end of the subject.
If we are forced to extend the deadline, Boris Johnson's end and all of us are over.
John Major rejected Boris Johnson not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a convent speech, the first minister in the Tories' arm said: “The realm tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he is struggling with the bulls in Scotland, checking eggs in Wales and arguing with citizens on the main streets of the city – all in front of the world, as if the election campaign had already lasted for good."
The spokesperson admitted yesterday that the agreement was still distant and added: “No one should have illusions: a very long road to ensure agreement.”
However, the spokesperson also said that the Benna Act implementing the Brussels Act by three months in the absence of an agreement "is actively weakening our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Mr Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will hold more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the work of the whole Irish area for food and rye.
A dog with no nose and legs beats Instagram.
Perfectly non-perfectious
The pussy was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with her pet from first sight.
“ Initially, I had difficulty believing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs,” she said.
A woman decided to take care of a bitch until she was adopted.
But no one's ever reported.
“The fact that no one wanted it, made me want to take care of it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate told me.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly inperfectible.
We love her what she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, it's his problem, not ours," she said.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
Instagram, she's over 14,000 internauts watching her.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never make a career on TV with the glasg accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV guys said that because of the Glassew accent, "he's never going to make careers" as a presentr.
She admitted that before her first show on the screen, she felt a lot of upset before her first appearance.
"I was only 25 years old, and I was very upset," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a research specialist, the boss of the boss said that by my accent with Glasgow, I would never succeed on TV.
I went to London to meet the entire TV-am team and watch the program emissions before I took over my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with the Bette Davis star performed by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly was a Scottish correspondent for TV in 1984, she started her career as a local reporter in East Kibride in Scotland.
Then she started running programs like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start with her morning program "Lorraine", which she named from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be a celebration of a special program, during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long internship on television is “pasture and enthusiasm” and “circumcise,” adding: “It is hard to work.
Be honest and authentic.
Preparing for programmes and being both interested and interesting.
When he mentions the media reports that moved her emotions, Kelly reveals that "very difficult" for her was the relating of the murder in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children were watching our program live from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of 16 children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for many hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I attended.
She added that “almost difficult” was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that “it really admires their strength and courage.”
They have to deal with pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition to raising the most awful comments on Internet trolls.
I am with them all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will begin at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, 30 September at ITV Station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The superior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer to take over the President's office, consisting of President Robert Mugabe, at the peak point of return, because he was afraid of imprisonment in order to confirm the takeover of power by the troops in November 2017.
As reported last week, "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the army in the framework of the coup.
However, a senior government official announced in social media that Chiweng did not reject his offer of fear, but because he had examined Mugabe’s plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the return.
On Twitter, which confirmed that the 37-year-old rulers of Zimbabwe wanted to transfer the power to Vice-President Chiwenga rather than President Emmerson Mnangagwi, Jamwanda 2, which was confirmed to the State officials that he was a senior government official in the Bureau of Presidents and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that, at that point, there was an intense negotiation on the matter.
State officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys, when he realized that the authorities were getting away with him.
The resolutions between the military authorities and the deceased were three stages, according to the senior government official.
The official claimed that there was a spokesperson of President George Charamba among the participants, then the head of the Aaron Nheper and the priest representing the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been a second element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to give the President of Chiweng, who was the Head of the Zimbabwean Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was even more than considered an African icon in vain, tried to gain a condemnation of military action from the UA, trying to urge other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Head of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiweng, did not result from the choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political stumbling, through which the dead wanted to reverse the situation in a completely diplomatic manner.
It is enough to remember that the commanders have said that they have not covered up and covered the constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the AU's position on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SS (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, breaking the leadership's statements violently, that they did not refute the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that UA, which, on the other hand, continued to be highly disoriented with the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical tamponomy of revolutions, would then have had no other choice but to describe it as a reverse, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
This offer was made in such a spirit and with such extortion.
The officials said Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defence forces had no longer been prepared to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign the letter of resignation after warning the manager that she was risking the Kaddafi-style rope.
The chiefs of the army told him they wouldn't return the gun against the citizens if they went to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, which means to save his family and prove that the army had taken over power", added an official.
The early SSO and the commanders have properly read the assumptions.
The Emissary (Gono) was able to understand this desperate message – through a powerful metaphor – that the Isu ziri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to a section of the Chabbles, i.e. the Army), we are not politicians or are competing with each other at political level, claimed by a higher government official.
State officials say that the army has notified military commanders in the area through the attachés who have stayed in Zimbabwe that they are not going to destroy Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding "criminists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to resuscitate Mnangagwa to return from a short exile in South Africa, so that they could talk about overwhelming and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe was also looking for assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, which is a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc, denied intervention, but clearly pointed out that if the military came into Mugabe's house, as the troops of South Africa were to strike in the background many times, they would immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said "the Independent" an informant.
China needs strong leadership, or it will "lost" as stated by the policy document
China needs a strong, deniable leadership of the Communist Party, as otherwise the country 's fall' – stated the government in a policy document issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office reported in the White Paper that the successes of the country since the Communists had taken over 70 years ago are in the leadership of the party.
China has a large area, with complex national conditions, and it is rarely difficult for administration.
The document mentions that, without the single and strong leadership of China, they will move towards division and decay, which will be catastrophic to the world.
When solving problems, the Chinese authorities have long been applying a tough hand policy as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, President Xi Jinping, who will be in charge of the celebrations of the second largest world economy on Tuesday, from the moment of taking office at the end of 2012, has further strengthened the parties' governments and made sanctions against those who may question power.
Xi also supervises the military modernisation programme, which has cut off this region's balance.
The document states that China is not trying to export its model of development or does not want to import any foreign models, simply to peace and not to "hegemonia".
Chinese don't have world domination in the genes of substantiation or dominance.
In the modern days of China, they were destroyed by great powers, and wars and anxiety cut off upon them a deep mark as a result of the sufferings they suffered; China will never give others the suffering they suffered themselves.
China is concerned with this anniversary in uncertain times for the bitter trade war with the United States and facing the challenges of the slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in China Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "god" its most important interests or allow them to harm their sovereignty.
As regards the trade dispute between the country and Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade war and the further increase in tariffs do not lead to problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a broad place on the market and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "the trade will never weaken it".
China is sure that they are able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a reasonable look at China's development because China does not intend to question the position of the United States or want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and yet less likely it is to stop China's development.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transmission of national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
The world of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the true face
Dubai's people still looking for their own identity, torn between the Bedouin tradition, the religious radicalism of Islamicism and the extremism of progressiveity.
This setting of new trends leading world tourism builds on imagination and desire, laundering the vacuum of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting the search for fortunes of investors and traders with the status of tax havens.
The web pages impress the enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of architecture of the 21st century in one.
The rich in the rich in the oil of the sands became Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools of hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are delighted with the vastness, appreciation for creative hyperactiveism and hissterical pursuit of vanguardism.
Here is the city of which motto says all: “Traise, deceive and enchant.”
And almost every step of it.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, “the entire extremes and contradictions of the metropolis have taken the dimension of the cheap grotesque.”
She turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the "Guinness Record Book", an unofficial Winter Constitution.
Because here everything has to be bigger and nicer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something in the old Europe that is perhaps not transparent, but vital to the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like they're in their home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure not.
Running from the wonder world, I broke his gold mask, revealing the other face of an artificial paradise.
A calculation that doesn't speak of or write about.
I am showing poor Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine ethnic castes of Dubai, the grandsons of the illustrious Bedouins.
I'm going to go to a place of extreme poverty, such as ghettos on the outskirts of the city, where there is an army of Asian workers under cruel conditions.
This is what they built in one generation in slave conditions that reach the sky of desert Manhattan.
They came here with good wages and the opportunity to give decent life to their families, and they became a nightmare.
This tourist will never see, because it could blow up the air created by mit Dubai for years.
More and more criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour highly difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned their home calls on diets after her struggles with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm from the Spice Girls team admitted that there was no food ban in her home after she struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sporty Spice hasn't been in possession for years and has “obsessively practiced” as a result of the pressures associated with being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
Currently, she reveals that her experience affects the way Scarlet's daughter is raising, so "it does not allow her home to talk about diets".
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I begin to see that he is more aware of his appearance" - said Mel.
“I think one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for the Women's Health Mel magazine, who won the fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before social media was formed mixed in the press, the comments on its subject caused complexes.
"I began to look at myself in the wrong way, giving up on certain groups of food products, practicing increasingly obsessively, until I started having an inconsistencies" - he says.
"I was sick and it was probably a few years old."
The picture that has shaken the world
The Polish girl and the American documentary filed a witness to the world about the cruelty of war.
The legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen in the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
“ Listen to my story.
I'm speaking from the sieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", he began his radio documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On September 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, and he saw the drama of a bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was a wide echo in the West.
President Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a letter saying goodbye to his family in the U.S., putting him in the safe of the embassy, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be anywhere he was worth.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan was captivating death, suffering, a struggle to survive in the city's petals.
Just before the surrender, along with the embassies, he took the negatives to the ocean.
He didn't set up Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles were watching President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the US began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films of glorifying their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, the son of Julien.
A jury hearing against a former athlete of rape
There's a process of rape against the jury, and you've been hit by a team of Delaware colleges who's facing numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of submitting testimony and listening to arguments, the jury members proceeded to settle Clay Conaway's fate.
A woman who was 21 years old claims Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two of them met on the side of the Bumble meeting and sent a female by the man who was naked.
The woman is one of six accusers of Conaway's sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
According to the plaintiffs, the hugging that the woman agreed to has fallen into violence as opposed to it.
The defenders rely on the conflicting relationships between women and gaps in memory and claim that a woman was likely to have regretted that an intimate relationship had occurred.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for millions of zloty
The gold-covered bike was worth a million zloty that was seen on the jubilee, the 10th edition of the International Tower Market Fair BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz has just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Cup of Customivs in Las Vegas.
The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, beneath which is the highest silver test.
It's an unusual coating made by my friend at the Zor.
“There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could normally drive it.
He could expand his speed 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," explains his constructor.
“The bike car was printed on a 3D printer.
It's made of a kind of faith.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on my card and hid it deep into my drawer.
The sketch was waiting five years to be realized.
The bike itself was built for three years", added Adam Zdanowicz.
“It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
There's batteries inside, wires, elements that make up construction.
It is hidden under the bodywork laid in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
The engine is hidden there, too.
The bike was built for a week before I left to the United States at the World Exhibition of Rowers.
I couldn't quite decide what the steering wheel was like.
She's part of the transport.
The bike weighs 90 pounds", summarizes.
Covered with gold, the bike was appreciated in Las Vegas's most important competition category "Best Amazing Single Customer".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by an opera building, the Circular Quay port, Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge brings a substantial contribution to the amount of 22.9 billion dollars, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But it's ugly under the bridge, though.
Sydney’s well-known bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country to which the volume of contaminants affects the capacity of approximately 15 Olympic swimming pools each year.
These horrifying statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions one of our most gross akwens.
According to the new film material entitled "The Gulf of Sydney – on the mountain and below", the waters in the vicinity of the most popular city of Australia are full of non-violent, plastic meshes and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this flows into the bay along with rainwater.
But the biggest part of our shipping channels is plastic.
"I'd call it a paradox" – Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Research Director Sydney Harbour Research Programme, says in a published 27th September, and the publication of this film is taking place on World Tourism Day.
This akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated rivers along our coast.
The CSIRO estimate that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is going into our waterways, and most of it affects the bay through the storm drain.
"After such heavy precipitation... it seems quite tragic" - said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of pollution comes from the rainwaters.
However, as for the iceberg, Sydney’s flood problem is much more important than the surface of the water, as 70% of the pre-sea plastic goes to the bottom of the sea.
"As long as there is no time under water, you cannot really realize what is in the depths of the water," said Richard Nicholls, the owner of the Dine Centre Manly, stating that he and his team are drawing about 500 kg of plastic out of the water a year.
I think if more people knew (which is underwater), they would just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom is plastic grids.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all the other garbage we're getting right out of the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and management director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist – could help reduce the amount of plastic and residues that come to our waterways.
"This has to start at the source" - he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, drive back the materials, and be more aware of what we drop in the sewers that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
However, we can adjust this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company under its broader efforts to train Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that often come into the environment will occur during the study on the relationship between plastic and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey conducted among 546 children aged 12 to 18 years established that 82% of respondents felt helpless against plastic waste, and 25% of adults are guilty of problem with waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that they were growing concerns about the amount of plastic waste coming to the oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to ecological anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after a game of volleyball in semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenians had a natural audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish volleyball.
There was also a lot of controversy among judges who did not count on the host side in one of the actions.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when Vitala Heynen's captors had a chance to surprise the rivals and win the first party.
However, this was not the case, and the Poles eventually had to recognise the height of the rival, which after winning 3:1 will play in the tournament finals.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support the psychiatric hospital in Akra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association offered food yesterday with a worth of 30,000 GH? a psychiatric hospital in Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
This is part of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshi Market complex.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner PKO BP
Operator of National Church, PKO BP and PFF, concluded a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Products Google Cloud Platform will be included in the offer of Operator Church, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – the weight of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global public cloud installation in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions behind the project set up by the National Church, initiated and developed by PKO Bank of Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The partnership of the National Church and Google is another important step on the road that we set out less than a year ago, declaring the appointment of the National Church Operator.
The target remains unchanged – the digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamic of its growth.
“Now, Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of a promotion to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today significantly strengthens our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiel, President of PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFF strategy, as an important element of national digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions to entrepreneurs based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also lead to the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it", added Paweł Boris, President of the PFF.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all Google Cloud Platform products such as Compact Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
Including Google Cloud’s services in the Church of Nationals will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that benefit from their global competitors.
However, thanks to us, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", noted Michael Potokek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megagrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power needed to process huge data sets.

The first representative of University III Age and Senior+ Club and the second one named SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animators.
In the area of the university campus, organizers prepared gastronomics and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering senior services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion booths.
For example, on the stand of Stylish Seniors of the Senior Voice from Hanna Piekarska professionals and designer Agnieszka Wyrał, you could get tips and information on current trends in the 60+ fashion.
The stand also offered a workshop of learning how to move through the stage and a location for photos.
The finale was the fashion show of the Stylish Seniors.
At the stand of the Polish Seniora Voice there was the latest edition of the writings and the materials concerning the campaign “Stop manipulation – Don’t buy at the presentation”.
The next booths offered beauty, movement, plastic and artistic workshops.
Several could have been examined and consulted with professionals on health and nutrition issues.
The discussion panels were also organised, among others: Helena Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojářy-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykov or Robert Janowski.
There was no vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
There was a legend of Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was a intergenerational dancing that led DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils can have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Doctors in medicine have discovered how to mask some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process is happening in the Tasmanian Devils and in humans
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do Tasmanic devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include the key to the treatment of facial fatal tumours that threaten the future of the threat of the Tasmanian devil.
The study determined how to mask some cancer cells both in humans and in baggers, using a group of PRC2, which shuts down the marker, which otherwise would give the immune system to attack cancer.
This may pose the biggest challenge to the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblomy and skin cancer, called Merkel cell cancer.
"The great significance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immunity to immune therapy, we can be able to reverse this process", said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to reinitiate markers, a protein called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"It has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," Professor Dawson said.
“ This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that one day the discovery will be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian Devil, where cancer cells tend to avoid detection in a similar way.
"It is unusual that the process is exactly the same (in the case of cancers in humans and in the Tasmanic devils)", said Professor Dawson.
“It has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devils so far.
But if human medicines can also be used in the Tasmanic Devils, it is possible that this will help control the disease".
Scientists will be amazed at the fact that there is a very large planet around a really small star
Scientists express surprise after discovering a solar system of 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of creation of planets, as in this large planet similar to Jupiter around a small star called the red dwarf.
An artistic illustration of the planet's type of gas giant GJ 3512b circling a central star, which is a red dwarf, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much bigger than even the greatest planets circling them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and planet are slightly different.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 represents about 12% of the size of the sun, while the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the greatest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise" – said the astronaut Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, which was at the top of the research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low weight generally become stem stars for smaller planets similar to the earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a gas-type giant similar to Jupiter circling a very small star" - Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, is discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It covers its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only around 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately less than 3800 degrees Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color" - said Morales.
“There are evidence of the existence of a second planet running around this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter” said Morales.
Planets are created from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to a star around which planets are circling.
According to a leading model of planet formation called acrection model, the site is originally formed from solid particles in the disk and the gravity force of the planet at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere to be formed from surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravitational instability model.
“In this case, a protoplanetary disc around a young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold” said Morales.
This leads to problems in the stability of the disk, and so some denser areas may arise.
These masses can grow until the planet is fallen and formed.
Delicate employee accused of administering dipu bean co-workers containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion was arrested by Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old for the administration of methumphetamine-containing beans dip colleagues.
On Thursday, from Albany 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of delivering methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of second degree.
The charge was dropped on the basis of the September 9th event at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In the statement made by OregonLive.com on the oath showing the likelihood of a 27-year suspect's fault, she told the Deputy Sheriff of Marion County that she saw, during her lunch break, how Medina-Hernandez made the dip beans, which she subsequently attended.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, which according to what the investigator said, never took the metamphetamine, said that “she thought that one of the victims tasted strangely but did not raise any suspicions. ”
When she came back to work, she felt she had a stomach dissipation and she couldn't stay on her feet.
As the newspaper Albany Democrat-Herald reports, she went to a local hospital, where it was determined that the beans dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of reports from The Smoking Gun, according to the police, another three-way employee said that Medina-Hernandez "telled her that she would add drugs to food", while others admitted that the suspect sent her message, claiming that metamphetamine had entered the beans dip by accident.
The OregonLive website tells us about the recording from the delicacy monitors, which allegedly shows how the back of the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, becomes a microwave and bends.
Then it's settled, it wipes its nose, goes up to the table and into the composition of the bean dip in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
Orego's Statesman-Journal newspaper says the Sheriff's staff are saying there's no suspicion that customers are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez resides in Marion County Prison, a deposit of 520 000 dollars.
According to The Smoking Gun's extensive police record, the woman was already sentenced to assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamines, theft, possession of metamphetamines and possession of illicit weapons.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": castings for Jamie New to West End
Another big star in West End is waiting to be discovered, though he doesn't know it yet.
Music Manufacturers "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" are looking for another Jamie New, and they're holding an open hearing.
The current star Layton Williams is going out with a musical on tour in the UK, so producers in his place are looking for "a uniquely talented young performer".
The London hearings will take place on October 10 in Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 bars of the opening work "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CV and portrait photo.
The hearing will also take place on October 8th in Sheffield, and in the next week before the producers will present people again invited to the presentation.
The producer Nico Burns said: “We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic audience the musical will be played for another, third year in Apollo.”
We found some fantastic young performers joining Layton Williams and Shane Richie during the tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we are opening opportunities for unknown talents to join current young professionals.
Williams, who was involved in Jamie New in February and thus replaced John McCrea’s original role on Twitter, encouraged “All boys to send their tapes”:
The tour of this musical will begin in February and the performances at West End were extended until 29 August 2020.
Musical presents the fate of the 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the ball at the end of school in the dress.
He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure to be a star.
With the help of the mother and local legend, the drag community of Loco Chanelle begins to discover its identity, to oppose prejudice and career in the light of the curse.
Music in this presentation was inspired by the BBC documentary film entitled “Jame. Drag Queen at 16” wrote by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and words of songs – Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval is commissioned in the natural gas industry with a value of 110 million SEK
Alfa Laval, a world leader in heating, thermal separation and liquid transport, has been commissioned to supply air cooling facilities to the US gas treatment plant. This Recommendation is worth approximately 110 million crowns and has been registered in the Spa hot exchangers department in the energy piano, and supplies are planned for 2020.
The recommendation includes Alpha Laval Niagara air coolant systems, which will be used in cooling systems for the distribution of natural gas into individual streams of its clean components – ethanol, propane and butane.
Security is crucial in all industrial processes and is extremely important in demanding applications for natural gas treatment.
"Our reliable air cooling installations are pleased to be recognised because of their safe work, which provides peace for customers in the natural gas industry", says Susanne Pahlen Aklundh, President of the Energy Pion.
Did you know... ethanol, propane and butane can be removed from natural gas and then used for example as a input for petrochemical installations, house heating or as a fuel for vehicles?
Information about Alfa Laval

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about the head of the NIC?
Real estate rental for the amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
We asked about what the vault is doing in the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in a report for the “Superwizjera” TVN raised doubts about the claims made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banas.
The Central Anticorruption Office has been investigating for several months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was supposed to rent a building with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,7 thousand zlotys per year.
The Superwizjera report revealed that the hotel was located in the building house for hours.
The head of the NIC then translated on state television, why he received only a little more than 5,000 zlotys per month for renting the property.
“Vyborcza”, referring to experts from the valuation of real estate, estimated that this should be 15,000 zloty for the building itself.
“ The amount was lower for a simple reason: I made a pre-emptive agreement and the fact that the tenant was supposed to buy this building was that I agreed to the lower rent that the remaining claims would be settled in the sale of the building,” Banas said.
However, there was doubts as to whether such proceedings constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a press spokesman of the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow, announced in the discussion of TVN24 that “the matter is directly addressed by the Ministry of Finance.”
"All such questions, please refer to the Minister of Finance," he added.
The error explained that in such cases, "actions are carried out by the National Treasury Administration".
The press spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself monitors many cases that can raise any objections.
“The Treasury administration works in such a way that it has its own information and is based in some way on the information available to the public.
On this basis, he decides whether or not to conduct any specific case," explained the MF spokesperson.
"The fact that we are all in force in the whole department of finance is a treasure mystery, which is why we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," stressed the question of Marian Banasia.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "the Treasury authorities will not provide such information to the public."
"It is clear that the whole treasure camera is dealing with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Royal family secret: Surprising guests often flying by king's plane have been revealed
Within their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of trips around the world during their lives.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world for important events and speeches.
It's no surprise to have your own plane with privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to afford long lines for repairs, their limits on the number of luggage and, as it turns out, may be invited on board any guests – including truly unusual.
According to a recent Prime Minister on Channel 5, not only queen and prince Philip often travel on a royal plane.
During the program entitled “Secrets of Royal Flights” the queen’s flight navigator revealed that, along with the royal family, there were often furry guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes with our very important royal guests, the royal dogs could go very important.”
It is not surprising that the queen could wish to be accompanied by her beloved favorites on her journeys, because she is known for her deep attachment to Corgi dogs.
Since she was young, Queen Elizabeth has been a fan of these four-legged creatures and hears that she has been the owner of more than 30 Corgi since she was crowned.
It is said that in 2007 she had five Corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
Five cokers slept with them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Spani, as well as four dogs that are a cross-crosser of Corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal plane crew certainly had their hands full.
A staff member of the royal home was seen bringing dogs and asking them to do their needs before taking them aboard the plane – says Shields further.
I'm glad to say there's never been any incident.
The programme also reveals a shocking number of luggage that the Queen takes with him on board during his journey in the performance of his duties.
The film Narrator said: “In 1953, the queen in her journey of 70,000 kilometres took the luggage weighing 12 tonnes. ”
To be able to see it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants as possible.
But the queen isn't the only person with the weakness for fashion.
It is said that Princess Cambridge also has its own pleasure in transporting her wardrobe – it is said that a separate seat is intended for each of her dresses.
The new law enters into force.
In cases of accidents, benefits will be paid.
On Friday, the Financial Ombudsman informs the Court of Auditors.
This is the Law of 9 July 2019 on the special powers of persons injured in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee sum fixed on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
In some cases, insurers have already ceased their pension payments.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been seeking to create a mechanism for many years, which will ensure that financial support from the insurance sector and the OC farmer, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee, has been guaranteed by Alexander Daszewski, a legal counsellor at the Financial Ombudsman's office.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because it is often very tragic situations for people in a very bad health condition which, due to the accident, cannot work, for example, and at the same time have significant costs for post-rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer have received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sum on the OC policies.
Some of this has been threatening in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurers were significantly lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of the exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years most often touched people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee sums were very low, and economic circumstances led to price increases.
"We also noted that this problem also had a number of mostly young people who had suffered damage during the period when the sum was EUR 350 000 for each affected in the accident.
Today it is €5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference with earlier periods, which required legislative intervention", recalls Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee sum has been increased at some point in time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the sum of the guarantee in force at the time when the claim for payment of the pension is addressed to the Fund.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court ruling setting out a different guarantee amount than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This is the case in the case of an increase in the guaranteed sum on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing obligation.
“ In the last few days, we have sent letters to people who have been asking for intervention in the past.
We will inform them of new powers and, of course, provide for further support if any problems arise", says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini sentenced to cut off the boy's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
As Buenos Aires Times says, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a friend sex tape that was built in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who was an architect, explained to the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her as a “tropheum” that could be praised before friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
She destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's apartment decided to measure justice itself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed, and told him she prepared a special surprise.
With the axamite ape, she blinded his eyes, then grabbed his secator and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull up my pants, and grab my cell phone to call 911," he testified.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by revealing sex tape, she didn't try to escape her responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said to the jury.
She was finally convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Congressman of Alabama, Jack Edwards, died at the age of 91.
On Friday, a retired Congressman of the state of Alabama died on behalf of the Republican Party Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The Ombudsman said that Edwards died in his house in Fairhope after a fight with the pancreas cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans in the state of Alabama on the Deep South, thanks to the fact that the party gained supporters here.
Congress has served 10 mandates.
According to a statement made by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return his courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where there will be joint debates and efforts to solve the country's problems," said Edwards, according to family statements.
The governor of the state of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his status and national with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that in his honor the flags on the Alabama State Capital would be abandoned to half the estate.
“He was the person of a true civil servant and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most prominent politicians" - said Ivey in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiring" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Princess Sussex “a triple leader who breaks the diagrams and makes our world better.”
The prince and Prince Harry, currently in royal travel to South Africa with their son Arch Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with young people at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @ssexroyal, “a caring leader who breaks the diagrams and thanks to which our world becomes better,” wrote the first lady in her enthusiasmist post.
“While this meeting with the leaders of Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation, whether helping girls around the world to access education they deserve is an inspiration for many people,” Obama added, putting a picture of the smiling Meghan with the leaders of the Foundation.
Meghan had an interview with Obama for the September edition of Vogue, a guest editor of the former "Suits" series.
In fact, there was the first lady to talk about motherhood and how he changed it.
"To be a mother is to lead to the mastership of the art "" said Obama in an interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that for most of the time my task is to give children space to be able to learn about the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who I wanted to be in the heart of my heart.
Obama, who knows from experience, the pressure of being on the candlestick, shared with the princess during an interview with the magazine Good Housekeeping.
“The stress that you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – can overwhelm you sometimes” – she said.
“ My advice is, therefore, not to slow down and rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughter, making sure they're doing well in school and making new connections before I've devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner's personality
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Washington Commission for the control of alcoholic beverages gave up a request to check whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its licence for the sale of alcohol due to the owner's personality.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges, and two rabbis is unfounded, because most of them do not live in the district nor have any real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" states that, for the second time, these reasons are already seeking to withdraw the alcohol-saled hotel by referring to the provision in force in the district, which says that the applicants for an alcohol-saled licence must be "good personality".
Last summer's original complaint claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and there were accusations of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The second complaint was based on the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": The fascinating report acknowledges the most popular police scandal in Cleveland for the worst in the UK
Inspectors recognised the SEMPORITY SKANDALAMI to the police as the worst in the UK.
In the passing report, the Cleveland police evaluated as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty's Royal Police Department claims that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland Police Services.
There have been new calls for solutions to police services, where five chiefs have been headed in six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty's Royal Police Department said: "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards."
Commandant Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation on "warranty", but unwarranted, allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts has been suspended after arrest under a charge of gross deficiencies.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood became in front of the Board of Crimes for contributing his co-workers to sexual activity.
He's gone from duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of Torys said: “This is an official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office to intervene."
Police chief Richard Lewis said: “After improvement, I take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces by change.”
We've got a visual on the skatepark!
Are young people finally waiting?
The older people are intimidating the young passion to ride on the hulaids and deskoirs, and they are also complaining that there is no place for them in Oława.
For years young people have been reminded of the place to ride rollers, deskorollers, loujnogs, bikes.
The theme is still coming back to our lies.
For 10 years, we have been paying attention to this problem.
It's been loud again lately about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to it and we're asking in the office, what's next?
We remind you that a woman has spoken a few days ago, which is disturbing young people, driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block at Płsudski, so that you can be interested in the situation of the Oławna youth", writes the editor of Małgorzata.
“The blockrs called the City Guard on numerous occasions.
I'm sending pictures to proof of such everyday situations."
We asked the others about the case.
Most clearly states that young people simply have nowhere to ride in the city and for years call for a place for themselves to be.
There was even an avalanche of comments under the Facebook post.
We already wrote in July that there is a chance that the skatepark be built on the Olawske town.
The Mayor has informed us that the city has applied for funding for the construction of a skatepark.
‘The young project and the licences are ready to be consulted.
On 28 March, an application was issued to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding the tasks of the «Building Skatepark in Oława» under the Sports Programme of Poland", we were told at the office.
Total value of the project: PLN 798 306,00
Requested amount of funding: 263 440,00 PLN.
Now we've asked again what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have any information on the distinctions made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism on the application for funding," says Elizabeth Bednarczyk, Chief of the Department of European Funds, Oława.
"The information obtained from the Ministry's staff shows that the choice of all tasks under the Sports Programme should be made in October".
We also asked for the visualisation of the Olawian Skatepark.
We present it below.
Young people reported that they would collect signatures under the petition on the construction of a skatepark in Olava on Saturday (28 September).
“The youngsters who are young saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a fundraiser,” writes Santa.
The certificates under the petition will be collected from 12.00 in Lidl's area.
Cup of Poland 2019/20: draw 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit from years ago.
It was one of the brightest rivalries in the extraclass.
The biggest legend in the year 1996/1997.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took over an old stadium in Łazenkowski, a team in the previous line.
Both teams divided the point.
The hosts had to win, the Vizzew second in the order of the Polish Championship gave a point.
By the 87th minute, Legia ran 2-0, but for five more minutes there was an earthquake – Wiżew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club, over the years, fell into an ever growing trouble until he stopped counting on himself in the battle for championships and fell from the highest football game.
For the last time, the two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – on the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 with him and 1:0 on the exit.
Back to elite
The boats are now fighting for their return to national elites.
These plans were delayed for at least a year, as in previous games, one of the favorites could not get promoted to the extraclasses.
As a result, a failure in the summer occurred at the club to the village revolution.
The authorities had changed, finally placed on Coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy they were supposed to assist in the league struggles of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możżń.
For now, Vizdew is the fourth in table II of leagues, but in the Polish Cup beat on Tuesday, the vice-president extraclass Silesia Wrocław 2:0.
The legion in the same sizes was played on the desert Niepołomice.
Extractive startup
The only pair of representatives of the highest class in 1/16 of the finals are made up of its baeniamek ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
This phase shall take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, the 1/8 final play was planned for the year (3-5 December).
The finale is due to take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “slow down” and an impeachment investigation must take his course.
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we're trying to hide the facts, and the investigation in this case may take a while", said Pelosi in an interview for CNN in the Capital Hill.
“They are doing the job they started, keeping to the facts and the time needed to find them,” she added.
From the protocol issued this week by the White House, it appears that Trump asked the president of Ukraine Vołodymyr Zelenski to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Zełenski to take this issue to work with Barre and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as shown by the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department notified by a complainant concerning the Trumpa proceedings involving Ukraine more than one week before the formal notification.
After receipt of a complaint as officials from Intelligence Community, the Justice Department concluded that Trump’s telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation on campaign financing.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday, Intelligence Committee will decide who to call the witness.
She added, however, that Barr thought he had "slowed down".
It's been a long time.
“For this (Barra) is mentioned in all things,” Pelosi added, referring to the mention of Trumpa of her prosecutor general during July with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi said that “he is very afraid” about the information subjects that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that there were other spies in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond their responsibilities, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – detection of crimes in our government, said Pelosi, adding “The President’s word for the people who can provide information seriously undermine the integrity of the government”.
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step in the announcement of a formal investigation to commit an act illegal on the basis of the allegations of an attempt to put pressure on a foreign leader in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone discussion included a complaint published on Thursday, where the signaler claimed that Trump had exercised his authority to "prove Ukraine to interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signator also claimed that the White House lawyers had told the officials to remove the recording of conversations from the computer system, where they were kept for officials of the Council of Ministers, and to put it in a system dedicated to sensitive information.

Possible prohibition to drive a car for excessive speed for the attacker of the Crystal Palace Christian Bentke
The Premier League of Christian Benteke, which has doubled over speed in the last two months, threatens to ban vehicles.
Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to driving a Bentley car at 80 miles an hour on the ground with a limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond, South West London on 20 January.
Then in March of Putney, in the south-west of London, the photographers registered Belga driving at a speed of 89 miles an hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Benteke from Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to stand in the Peace Court next to Lavender Hill this morning.
He admitted to both offences at the beginning of July in a simplified procedure on the basis of which crimes are more judgmental at a meeting held by a single judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned with the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Secondi Hasaacas Club, raised doubts regarding the composition of the Verification Commission for the forthcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the involvement of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts whether the President of the Commission would show honesty because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons from outside who do not show links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
Davies, for example, employed the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwak Palmer as regards the payment of 10 percent.
He is also a known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, it is not necessary to allow him to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in it", he said.
Manu declared that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games had a conflict of interest before the Commission, because of its link with the club, while suggesting that, if Mr Palmer, he would be prejudiced and partiality before the Commission.
As expected, the Commission members were expected to start their work from yesterday, following the oath of the GFA Secretary ceremony in Akra on Tuesday, September 19th, and to end them on October 4th.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are consultants for corporate governance and lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and Legal Officer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the Government of Unity
Two main parties of Israel, the Blue-Bialy and Likud alliance, continued the negotiations on the appointment of the government of unity on Friday.
The meeting, which took place after the delegation of the President's mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanjah, did not result.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating the leadership of both parties in the government and leaving Netanjah as Prime Minister, but, as Israeli newspaper “Haarec” writes, there was no closeness of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Blue-Bialyst Central Alliance informed in its Communication that it presented the preliminary demands.
Likud's right-wing accusation for "defying in his positions", demanding that his leader and current prime minister, Netanyah, remain in charge of government, and in the composition of the office, which was before its composition of ultra-orthodox politicians.
"From the very beginning it was important to know that the Blue-Biali will not agree on these conditions", the announcement published by them.
The letter, acting solely in the interest of Netanyah, wants to “go to the second round of elections in Israel”.
The leader of the Blue-Bialals Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyahu would direct until they are accused of taking part in three corrupt areas, on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally charge him after the Wednesday meeting.
“Licide and Blue-Bialy gained enough in elections on September 17, which would allow them to act as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which one of the parties did not want,” wrote the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Riwlin has tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the establishment of a ‘rotation board’, suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the accusation against Netanjahu were sustained and formalised.
No lack of Israeli analysts who think things got stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of the poll published by the public on Friday, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under the rotating leadership of the change of Netanyah and Gantz.
50.6% of Israelis, 32.1% of the polls object to this solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should first stand at the office, 41.8% of the respondents advocates Netanjah and 40% behind Gantz.
In another survey published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the government of unity increases to 63%, 60% is opposed to new choices that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on September 17, Gantza won 33 mandates in the 120-town Prince, Likud Netanjahu won 32 mandates.
Netanyah and his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz is 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against the Australians in the end
Justin Tipuric says that “this is the time to check out” when Wales stands in the face of the final match with Australia in the World Cup that can shape their fate in the tournament.
Valia's victory over the "cangurists" would set this team on the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and ensure participation in a possible quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to the take-off with England in one eighth final.
"Let's make it clear, both teams want to try to get through this and find themselves at the head of the group", said the Welsh Raccoon Tipuric.
There were some difficult results in the past, but last autumn was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be eager to take that victory away from us, and we really want to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew this was gonna be a big getaway.
And now we're here, and this is really the time to check out.
Wales has only won one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in a game of third place when they defeated the "kanguras".
And their total record led by Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three teams of heavy weight from the southern hemisphere.
Valia has caught up with a number of 13 losers in Australia's hands in November last year, and Tipuric has prepared to be among the few survivors of that 9-6 win who will run to Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked if the team had experienced mental blocking before this victory, added: “It’s hard to say.
These matches are so balanced that maybe... people expect to have a mental lock, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks a lot smaller than it really was.
If Wales triumphs, then Tipurica's fight with a lovely Australian duo from the third mill line Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial in stopping and beating.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colors of representation and met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he is waiting for.
"He is a player who plays at the position of the seventh absolutely world class" - he said.
When you're playing against the world's world-class mill line players, it's always known that there's gonna be a difficult game to play.
These two are constantly occurring with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is the more attacking seven and he probably feels better rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and face each other rather than face the third mill line, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best and fighting with these two, I'm sure you'll have to be in top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday it's almost the final of the Cup, but it's an important match for us in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element of it.
When we build strength and keep making our efforts, we're going to go on our wings, and we're going to be hard to beat us.

The Prime Minister of the Book.
"Waffen-SS" by Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of "sirens."
They accepted in their ranks those they despised.
Is crime more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we don't give another book about war or military affairs.
We give a deep international study on the participation of non-Germany in Waffen-SS.
The historians from different countries of Europe are analysing the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, reminding them of their activities and looking at the recruitment processes at each stage of the war.
Was the Danish branches different from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't it have been possible to set up a Polish squad?
What is the official historic narrative about collaborating in different European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book “Waffen-SS” answers these questions on the basis of solid research material.
We wanted to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer truth to the image of collaborating in Europe during the Second World War, trying to break the methodological limits of history and history through the presentation of a report by researchers from different countries. (...) As many of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavian population - are sometimes presented in comparative terms and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are examined essentially from a national perspective (as far as this is done).
“A total panic” when the White House is struggling to find arguments on impeachment
The White House officials are going to get soaked up by finding out how to resist the emphasis on impeachment resumed on Thursday, and one of those who are familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan for responding to the new reality.
It seems that this calls for a "unrest, uncertainty and concern" – one of the White House people describe the mood in the western wing – that the charges of an informant can seriously harm the President and the people in his surroundings.
The person said: “There is no great certainty that there is nothing there.”
The White House officials were still unsure about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious action plan in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "This does not seem to be something that does not change when the next cycle of the news headlines" – the person made a complaint.
The other person who knew the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of shock" accompanied by an increasing distrust that, along with an ongoing investigation on impeachment, the president is likely to respond in an irresponsible manner and become "hard to control".
This fear is divided by another spokesperson claiming that people from the President's environment provide that he will display a more "resistive" behavior and the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase from every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unforeseeable behaviour and in an unexpected way to explode – this is a concern both from the point of view of the presidency and the elections in the context of the electoral year.
As he faced the greatest threat in the presidency, Trump has tried to defend himself again, following the strategy that he has assessed as effective in the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to consult his own request to the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals in order to draw attention and direct it to the activities of the Democrats and the candidate for Democrats Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a leading party motive.
But while many people in the White House are engaged in the fight after Mueller's investigation, something changed this time – they found advisers and consultants.
The President, who is a sign of strength, demonstrated the International Press Conference as a defeater, said one of those who are familiar with the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about the Russian investigation, he seemed not willing to answer the Ukraine questions – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that it is possible to avoid harm, and some of them are held by the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of this controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Vołodymem Zelenski – which, according to them, undermines his credibility.
And as often as the president is the object of the attacks, this fact is being raised alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies linked to the White House indicates that the results of a poll of support for the President are unbotially high, and the impeachment will not cause too much to gain new sympathies.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if it makes it difficult for its legislative programme and predominate in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another caller claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president didn't fully understand how unpredictable his response would be.
The officials of the White House were looking for help from counsellors, setting up an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of plans, taking into account that these efforts are in the early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the management centre style will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that there is a conviction that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader in the capacity to carry out an attack in the field of PR, which is designed to publish a remarkable signal report, with a view to halting the spread of democratic activities on the impeachment provided by the disclosure of this report.
The spokesperson of the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of the Treasury of Steve Mnuchin announced that they were not going to disclose notes describing the talks with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no exit and that the document had to be published.
The pressure is now expected to be greater than in the course of the investigation of Robert Mueller, who largely maintained silence and spoke solely through accusations. One of those who could be involved in the development of an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and the former head of the electoral staff, said the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski said in his conversation with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will run this action.
"For the last five years, I've done everything I could to support the president and his program," he said, "but I didn't take part in any talks with the president or his team to join the team in order to reverse the false narrative on impeachment."
The private lawyer Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the impeachment activities.
"We are responding to what is due" – Sekulow replied when he was asked by NBC News for a comment.
The White House currently feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the area of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked with the impeachment of Clinton and advised the White House at the end of the Mueller investigation, went away, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
A speaker familiar with the White House’s strategy stated that, at any time, officials were not planning to engage in people or create a command centre, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding “the naked pictures of Trumpa”
Congressman Devin Nunes of California, apparently, cannot bear the naked truth about the investigation of President Donald Trump.
In his fourth defense, the president accused the Democrats that they wanted to get a naked President's photograph.
Nunes, a high-level Republican in the Board of Representatives's Intelligence Commission, put the above charge in the course of the preliminary hearing following a complaint by a signaler, as if Trump had asked Ukraine for assistance in the initiation of an investigation against President Joe Biden and his son against the Democrat candidate.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotesque performance" of the left and their "medial asem" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see the photos of the President in the Negligent.
"The democracy in this committee was negotiated with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to receive a naked picture of Trumpa" said Nunes.
“People may rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the President in charge when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, a political reporter on HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... find out.
Until now, only the representatives of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we suspect that his response is the naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspected that Nunes' comments on nakedness refer to "the more secure and unconfirmed information", which are likely to appear in the controversial acts of Steele,
It's a blessing, collected by a former British spy named Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that says it shows him who's watching the power of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one question seems to be washing out renewable energy – aircraft.
However, the professor at Albert University has developed technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the Albert University of Agriculture, Life Science and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
His laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fat and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from lower quality oils during production, thus estimated to reach 85% of lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels and also from waste from other industries.
This technology has the task of imitating hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," Bressler said – [in total creation] of hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules as in diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new opportunity to use biofuels, the previously developed biofuels tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which was a serious risk for high-level aircraft.
"The air fuel problem is a bit of a wrong wheel" - said Bressler.
It's actually less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a small risk approach which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to work on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure stable fuel, even at low temperatures.
“We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit” – said Bressler commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on the commercialization of the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American army increase investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which a reverse situation can occur and the carbon tax will be imposed on them" - he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and has recently received a total of 4 million dollars from Lockheed Martin in an investment aimed at supporting the cost of $25 million of the production plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the planned carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will prevent further carbon reductions.
“As a technology specialist,” said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that enable conscious decisions and many options to choose."
NATURAL: Further fraud to the granddaughter
PLN 8 thousand and EUR 750 lost the apartment of Zamość, thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police informed the incident on Thursday, the son of a confounded mascara.
“ A man who was following her grandson called a woman on Wednesday.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help the grandson, the senior officer gave PLN 8 thousand and EUR 750 to the false police officer who came to her house", reports the asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubbiti from the overseas police.
The cops are looking for the perpetrators, and they're calling for caution again:
‘Every phone requesting financial assistance needs to be verified.
It is not necessary to act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Let's just remember that the cops don't ask for money and they don't take the money.
If we get a phone call for financial support, which will boost our suspicions, please respond immediately and inform the police by calling the emergency number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's tell them how frauds work.
Let us be careful and not trusting people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that if Britain's brix is withdrawn, they are threatening to come to Los Angeles, and he calls for peace.
One of the main ministers in the office said last night that the national threat of "social violence" if the primary result was challenged by the result of the second referendum.
The allies of the UK Prime Minister from his immediate surroundings warned that national concerns are at risk of "yellow" protests in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "feeling calm" during a turbulent argument on politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "dating."
Despite his calling for peace, the Minister of the Office said: "The Times": "In this country there were never such protests as demonstrations of "gillets jaunes" (the yellow vests) or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – they use encrypted phones to coordinate picnics and to push people into protest just a few useless populist leaders.
The riots in Los Angeles erupted after the jury exonerated four white police officers who beat Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
In this year, anti-government demonstrators in France carrying yellow reflective vests – gillet jaunes – for more than six weeks, they have been de-studying the streets of Paris.
The Minister referred to the warning of Johnson in the House of Gmin and said that if the UK fails to come out of the EU, there will be a "catastrophantal loss of trust in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people will vote and 66% of them will speak for leaving the UK in the European Union, the ten million citizens will remain unhappy" said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
There's not much need to be seen on the street soon, tens of thousands of people.
One of the main ministers in the office added that national threats to "community violence" if the result of the first referendum was questioned by the results of the second.
Johnson called for a universal election to be organised, where voters should decide the fate of a Braxity.
According to the report, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of developing an office that wants to reduce demands for Brussels and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
Hołnia, Chubkin and Krosna were delighted in Krakow.
Behind us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants were heard on Thursday (26 September) 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Simon Hołównia, Krystyna Cubówna and Ireneusz Krosna.
This is all in the framework of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expansion of horizons, conversations about the ideas of publicity and joint discussions that can become an impulse to further development.
Such an objective was set before them by the organizers of the conference Talk'N'Roll, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among others people known from the media - Simon Hołównia, Krystyna Chubkina and Ireneus Krosny.
This year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NEW" and it was around the future creation of guests invited to participate.
The first session opened by Managing Director Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who spoke about how the brand, which is building around, could affect our future.
Richard Lucas went on the stage to change the perception of the audience on the issue of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if you want to create a future, in turn Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the day of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a series of talks with Krystyna Čubówna, which, among other things, told about how the teacher’s profession in Poland changed from its perspective over the years.
One of the most popular voices in the country has admitted that, thanks to technology development, everyone can make it difficult for this profession today.
However, he does not consider that in the coming years, man’s position as a tutor is completely replaced by technology.
Peter Nabelec, right after him, took the problem of life at the time of the information, emotional overload, or the strain on the choice, giving the audience valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętoch in his speech spoke about what the next industrial revolution, known as "The Industry 4.0".
Playin', learnin' to play
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic expression by inviting an illusionist, Daniel One-Accommodator.
The third part of the conference opened Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the audience with pantonima, and then, on the example of his own career, told how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on the stage and his private life.
The participants also kidnapped Simon Holovnia, stressing in particular the role of time in our lives.
The Publicist noted that even two minutes may change the situation diametrically and must be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared his thoughts on the reality surrounding us, bringing together anecdote, which could give rise to smiles on the faces of the viewers.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on the stage, which reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, on the example of Rubik's cube, he told us about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new in the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch performances, and the natural reactions and many questions to the guests show a great commitment from the audience.
The organizers provided a transmission for all who could not participate personally in the event and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Governments instead of the rule of law.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority introduced a number of changes to the state system, causing threats to the rule of law and the principle of the three-participation of power," writes the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights on Thursday.
The report "The rule of law instead of rule of law" documents, inter alia, changes in justice and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published on Thursday a report entitled ‘The Governments of Laws instead of the rule of law.
Risks to protect human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019."
The Foundation assesses in the report that between 2015 and 2019 the biggest regression in the protection of human rights in Poland after 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of tri-division.
By adapting the right to political purposes, the rule of law was replaced by the rule of law", wrote experts from HFPC.
What's the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media and civil rights Ombudsman) and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair process).
The report also summarizes the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"For the first time in the past four years, we have observed the use of the right to carry out collective interests.
This translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as the weakening of the whole system of human rights protection in Poland", stressed Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been the "systemic revision period in both the country" and "human rights protection".
Over the last four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts which are crucial for the protection of human rights.
“They were often adopted at a speedily pace, without public consultation and despite objections to the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations,” explained the lawyer Małgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: ‘the weakness of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the failure to respect binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of human rights protection guarantees’.
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Human Affairs Foundation considered "the situations where state authorities did not react or simply underestimated the occurrence of aggression".
Foundation experts have noted that some changes have been made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the state's activities in the field of reducing the rule of law are the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a series of recommendations from international law players.
"The implementation of these recommendations does not only weaken Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also threatens the Polish state to be responsible for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights", we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistan's social media star with life for honor killing
Women's rights experts argue that justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspicious killers for bail and the loss of public awareness.
“It takes so long that people forget” – says Farzan Bari, a defense attorney of women’s rights and founder in Pakistan’s gender studies department at the university, and adds that even Baloch’s high-profile murder has been resolved over three years.
Although reliable data are difficult to establish by groups fighting for women's rights, the 2018 Pakistani Human Rights Commission stated at least 300 cases of honor killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of crimes from honorary motives estimates that in Pakistan there is about one fifth of the 5000 honor killings committed every year around the world.
Record Polish earnings abroad
However, transfers to the country are small because many migrants are sitting outside Poland on a permanent basis – says the Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other countries of Europe amounted to more than PLN 8,6 thousand in 2018, which means that they have grown by nearly a thousand zlotys, i.e. nearly 12%.
Euro-Tax ‘supposes that the total revenue of Polish economic migrants in the EU countries reached PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, by more than one seven years earlier,’ we read.
Director of the Warsaw University Migration Research Centre, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better on the international labour market where they use different options.
"The number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country from search for more and better conditions, as well as employees of international corporations," reports the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
“It’s the most in the RFN in 2018 because by 11% the total earnings of Polish emigrants (up to almost PLN 27 billion).
However, the biggest people in the islands have made almost PLN 35 billion", we continue to read.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement of working conditions in the Polish market, the number of economic migrants do not decline.
For still the sax in the West and the north of Europe (on the head of Norway) are often a chance to pay several times more earnings than in Poland.
“Even at minimum rates in the country in question, which, for example, is EUR 9.5-11.7 per hour in Germany, reports the logbook.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles remain not only due to higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave roots abroad, which is also seen after the smaller remittances to the country.
These last years have been the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Kościtecki recalls, with the extension of his stay abroad, a group of people passing money to the country decreases and their height decreases.
“The emigrants are getting close to each other,” we read on Friday’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
Prolonging monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and the unusual rainfall causes death as a result of the extermination of many crops.
Usually, in northern India, the monsoon disappears at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian weather department, if this situation continues for a few days, this will be the end of a decade at the latest.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unusual – recently in the west of India, the town of Pune Wednesday and Thursday rains led to the death of a dozen people and the desolation of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people took the streets in the water on their knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon apogeum.
Large rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Kalkuta, Lucnow and Hajdarabad.
Many houses have been destroyed due to long-term rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand.
The Monsun also started with a delay.
In many areas, there was no water, so farmers were preparing for the likely drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
Such a amount of rain isn't normal at this time of year.
"For him my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and the late ending monsoon is an increase in the price of onion, i.e. an irresistible Indian food ingredient.
Onions, which usually had to be paid for 20 rupees (0.23 UK pound), now cost 80 rupii (approx. 1 UK pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is the celebration of Dasara on October 8, during which the Indians rise up huge volumes like the comic book showing Ravena, a character with a moustache and a bad smile from the "Ramana" epos.
Rainan's smoking symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that the likes of Raven were made out of paper, if the monsoon persists, then Ravana will laugh at the last.

Dodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we are looking for answers to all of our tormenting questions.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?" "How?" and "How many?" are the favourite categories of Poles.
The giant data suggest that last year we were happy to ask, among others, "Where is the storm?", "How to make a spargie?" and "How many fingers have a horse?", "How to get rid of fruit flies?", "How to eat cocoa?"
Today, the search engine celebrates its 20th birthday.
Its users – and in Poland, up to 96% of people use “ Google uncle” – welcomes Google Doodle today.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard, and in the lower right, digital date was printed – as in the image from the 1990s.
Directory of information
The search was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalog all possible information and share it with the internet.
Her name is a game of word.
It comes from a mathematical term googol indicating the number of ten up to the centimetre.
This name was also intended to reflect the intention of the company to indicate as many pages from the world’s resources.
Google Search was founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which acted better than the method of normal alignment of results on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin started a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later they launched the famous google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, the “PC Magazine” appears information on the extremely high relevance of Google’s search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like it's a fairy tale - brilliant development with every month, subsidising the next markets and increasing the value of the company.
Already in June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion positions, which makes Page and Brina the world's largest search engine.
Currently the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.
Is there any other field to develop?
"The mission of Google is to organise global information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made great progress in this field, it is still a very long way ahead of us to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland said.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products at a high level may translate into a high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This has happened for a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who have been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more exposed to heart disease or stroke.
"This study highlights the need for personal protection equipment to be used for time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of registering in the medical records of contact with them at work, as well as control of standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease", said Dr Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa District.
The results were based on data on more than 6000 men on the island of Oahu, who took part in the cardiological programme Kuakini Honolulu.
As the researchers indicated, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations as it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have long half-life, so their health impact can be known for many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were seen within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
The press release Rodriguez stated: “After 34 years of observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.”
This was probably due to the fact that the ageing factors that masked possible causal relationships between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later years were more important.
Researchers have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Telephone conversation Zełinski-Trupp: Porošenko throws her three pennies
Waszyngton's policy has been taking a rough week to initiate the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump.
The political scandal is for the political debut of Vołodymyr Zelenski, which he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełinski-Trump offer, and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost for the preliminary phone call, Trump said that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, in detail they describe Trumpa's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders, along with other leaders of European countries, are engaged in negotiations rather than making concrete proposals.
The controversy raised the Zełenski response, which said that it was agreed with Trump not 100%, but in 1,000 percent.
Zielinski added that both French President Macron and Merkel were insufficiently seeking to help Ukraine.
This speech made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to speak through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was without a precedent".
In other tweets Porošenko said that he was grateful for the EU's support during the “Russian aggression” which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we now speak to Germany and France?”
After that, Trump mentioned military assistance and asked Zełenski for an investigation not in one and two cases: the first on the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the other related to the DNC hacking into the server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in an e-mail attack on the Democrats during the elections in 2016.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations, or that relations with the leader of France and Germany will be broken down.
I don't want to talk about anyone...
Thank you to all those who help us" - said after publication of the letter of telephone call from Zełinski in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelinski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of "the norm" to be held in October.
Former voivodship inspector of the law of the Union
The court has cleansed Jerzy Wiśniewski from the actions cast upon him.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court of Przemyśl was cleansed by Jerzy Wiśniewski, former Chief of the Military Inspector of the Trade Quality of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of over-the-countership.
Lubelska's prosecutor claimed that he was supposed to betray the Marshal of the voivodship's term of control at the food oil production plant.
He's recently fallen into the case with the law enforcement judgment.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
"The court held the judgment of the defendant under appeal," confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, Advocate of the District Court in Przemyśl.
It is the judgment of 14 February of the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on Facebook at that time: “It has been six years since I had been presented by the Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin about the alleged violation of the law in a telephone call with the Marshal of Podkarpackia on 30 April 2012.
The court unequivocally stated that I was innocent and did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone call then with Marshal Podkarpackie was in line with the applicable law.
The version of the events published by the media in 2013 by the Appealary Prosecutor in Lublin was true and caused irreversible damage to both the food producer and the loss of image of my person with my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The act of accusation against me in the opinion of the Court contained a number of errors, incorrect facts, illegitimate determinations of the legal basis, unconfirmed in the reality of events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszow, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately released from work and without financial resources.
I stayed long enough to keep my husband."
Let's remind.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as a voivodship inspector of the commercial quality of agri-food products in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed after the D.A. in Lublin presented the charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was supposed to betray the former Marshal of the voivodship (Mirosław Karapata was sentenced to four years of imprisonment) the time-limit of control in the food oil production facility belonging to the wife of the Deputy Marshal of Subcarpathian.
This warning – as the prosecutors of Lublin claimed – meant that the owner of the company knew about the controls and corrected the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of over-the-counter power, and threatened to jail for three years.
“I feel relieved that this case has finally ended and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the start, I was convinced that I didn't do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the rightful judgment that exonerates me from the charges," says Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House was trying to hide a record of conversations with the Greens
In a report made available on Thursday, the spokesman wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the president of Ukraine, Volodymym Zełenski, sought to interfere with a foreign state in the US elections, and White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the signaler, who is probably an interview worker, wrote: “In my service duties, I was informed by many members of the US government that the president used his function to demand interference from a foreign country in the election in the United States in 2020.”
“Trump used part of the conversation (from Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
He tried to put pressure on the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in the re-election in 2020," says the report, quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader, "recognizable" that the contacts with Trump are dependent on whether "disclosure the will to play" in cases which he should have told him more specifically of the lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
The author acknowledges that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was in detail informed of its contents by the “great number of White House officials who had direct information on this matter” and their relations were covered.
“In the next few days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that high rank representatives of the White House had intervened to “veget” all the archive records of this conversation, and in particular the literal writing that was drawn up, as usual, in the White House’s crisis room, we read further.
“High officials of the White House have told me that the lawyers of the White House have “avoided them” to remove the electronic records from the IT system where such records are stored.
The file was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," wrote the author of the report.
“In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the talks,” said the signalist.
As the AP commented, this document will probably accelerate the investigation into a possible impeachment of the President, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
He wrote an interview with the White House, following the pressures of Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship between those who witnessed it.
The contents of the report, as amended, revealed the day after which the Board of Representatives interview committee.
Also on Thursday, the director of the American interview, Joseph Maguire, testified to the Board of Representatives' intelligence committee and explained the way in which he treated the interviewer's report.
Maguire said that the soundman made the right choice and acted as he commanded the law.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the issue of talks with the Zełenski is an event "without precedent".
The protests in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the signal report to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, the confidential character of which guarantees the so-called privilege of executive authority.
Some of Maguire's interrogations by the committee were behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that, in view of the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the Chamber of Representatives will launch an investigation that might lead to the impeachment of Trumpa.
The day later, she appreciated the record of Trumpa’s talks with Zełenski confirms that the President of the United States has broken the standards for elections and security.
The US electoral law prohibits the use of foreign countries.
On Thursday the spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a set of relations with the third hand and a glassed press cutting together".
“The White Dom will continue to criticise this media hysteria and false narrative promoted by the main media nurtu”, she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO prizes
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize was awarded in the recognition that Ghana had received the highest in Africa the number of safety oversight points, i.e. 89.89 per cent in terms of the temporary effective implementation rate (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its control of the ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The security prize was evidence of the high country involvement in the implementation recommended by ICAO of standards and security protocols at airports and the Ghana airspace.
The award programme was designed to support the ICAO initiative called No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other security and 17 security certificates were awarded to ICAO Member States that improved their security and security standards.
During the award for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Civil Aviation Office Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain security in the air space by the Member States.
He said: "It is important that we keep in mind that even in the innovation era, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our core priorities."
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the efforts of the state because they complement the hard work and sustainability of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry had a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying that "aircraft has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything is based on security and security that we have achieved."

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as Managing Director of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifies at the Senate Budgetary Subcommittee on the FEMA Budgetary Proposal for the 2020 Financial Year at the Capital Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZENGTON (Reuters) – White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, acting as Deputy Administrator of FEMA, is a Head of the Agency who oversees government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency acted without the administrator approved by the American Senate from March when Brock long fired this position.
Long after the U.S. National Security Department, which is subject to FEMA, he said that Long used government vehicles to cross between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when a thorough examination of his past revealed the allegation that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination was expected to take this position.
Most of the Senate will be required to approve his nomination for this role.
The White House has informed that before Gaynor was appointed as alternate manager of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the maritime walk.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering the amputation of the finger
The 28-year-old runner specialized in a distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Vice-President of Europe at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not new and that he had already undergone one operation after the 2016 Games, but the pain was back, and they became very strong in this season.
The pain makes me place a foot, which, in turn, changes the system of my body, causes other unnatural burdens and starts to feel pain in other places, such as weather.
For this reason, I could not prepare myself enough for the world championships, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I have difficulty wearing earrings – said the runner on the air channel NRK.
The father and coach Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, they concluded that the only solution was not to end his career and participate in the future Olympic Games in Tokyo, amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although it's a drastic solution, and the decision has already fallen.
“If part of the body hurts, you should get rid of it, and in total, Henrik does not need that finger so much and in this situation you should forget about cosmetic aspect,” he explained.
Police shut down an illegal e-papiero factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal e-papiero factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
On the office building located on the street 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 a raid was made, during which the police sought illegals intended for the sale of e-papieros containing marijuana and during which a large straw containing butane hashish oil was found – concentrate from Indian hemps.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano, El Monte's officers also found a device that was used to supplement the calcium supplements.
"This process is very dangerous" says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
"The usual electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the flames of these fumes, causing not only the fire, but because of concentration, even the explosion" - he says.
“If there are many jars in the room and these similar things, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could erase the entire complex from the surface.
A team of special tasks was called on to the office to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, so they detected illegal activities.
The investigators are still trying to get information on who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on calcium damage.
“People don’t really know what products they buy” – says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This could be a threat to our community and our children, which is why we always keep them from going after things like this.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided to take the pill
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector informed us that the medicine was withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used for the treatment of fission and yeast infections of the mouth membranes, Gram-positive infections.
It can also be used in the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn due to non-conformity of the quality specification the smell of the product and the decrease of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month, the GIF spends on average several decisions on the withdrawal of each series of products from the market.
The series of medicine held in Poland can be reintroduced after presenting evidence of safety of its use.
If the medicine is withdrawn, it's not possible.
Banknot 19 zł – where to buy a collector's note about this denomination?
He wears a nominee of 19 gold and sees the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collector's banknote will be introduced into circulation – informed the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "Independence" note.
It is intended to remember the 100th anniversary of the Polish Stock Exchange.
As described in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the bill.
The date entered on the bank on 25 January 2019 is the date on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW.
Nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the Year of Creation of the Company" - reads NBP.
The watermark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
Now the holographic belt is located on a window in the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the title of "unsold" was presented a stylized image of the order of the White Eagle.
This text, drawn from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logo of the 100th anniversary of Poland's recovery of independence.
In the branch of the vanerine, symbolizing fraternism and victory, the security developed by PWPW-Umbra4Note was included, which is a special form of an angle effect.
On the reverse side of the note there is a image of the House of Construction on the background of the panorama of contemporary Warsaw.
Next to it is built in the logo PWPW protection SPARK Live and opalescent belt, also visible in the UV light of the repeated number "19" and the term "NBP" - describes NBP.
The bill is to enter circulation on 2 October into 55,000 units.
One note will cost 80 zloty.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from a special series, are a legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value significantly exceeds the one that can be achieved on the collectors market.
The new owner bought it for $500, which is over 2 million zloty, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported to a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded into a bar.
From there he sailed through a river of 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczynski will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
The President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński in the upcoming elections will give his voice to the Małgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczynski and Małgorzata Gosiewska invited the photo of the baner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw, the "three" boasted in social media that it will gain the voice of Kaczyński in parliamentary elections.
"Preses of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska", we read on her Facebook profile.
The boss of the party noted that he was a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to help.
"I will return my voice to Margaret Gosiewska, and I ask for the same thing," he appeals.
Gosiewska is running to Sejm from District 19th (Warsaw) and from third place in the list.
The only one there is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kamiński.
The Book Fair is coming.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
“We are here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podkarpacia are said not to read books.
We'll show it's different," said Martha halftorek at the press conference.
And who will support the readerry in Rzeszów this year?
As we have heard, there will be a sister Anastasia, the first cook of the Republic of Poland, as well as Luke Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bond, Karolina Korwin-Piotrovska and Jakub Kwiek.
This autumn in Millenium Hall will be held a great cultural event – 22 and 23 November the 3rd edition of the Book Fair – one of the most important news events in the region.
The fair will be the most interesting publishing and accounting officer from all over Poland.
There will be as many as 30, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their posts, they will present their wide publishing offers and hundreds of book news that market participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
What's more, there's a very special meeting with writers during two days of the fair.
This time, authors were invited to write about important issues and not afraid of making difficult topics, and they are also laureates of prestigious awards and... great cooking.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, the fairs were confirmed by Łukasz Orbitowski, the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-seller "Samost in the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime itself: Katarzyna Bond.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of a dozen books (including cooks) that sold over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of Elizabeth's missing dress And in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread of the dress made of the most outstanding silk stone has been decorated with hafts of vegetation, animals and butterflyes.
For Eleri Lynn, curators of the History Royal Palace exhibition, it meant only one thing.
The fabric that has been hanging for 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church, which she was looking at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's dressing room.
Three years after Lynn came across an exhibition of altar fabric in Bacton, Herefordshire, the missing Elizabeth dress, is due next month to go to an exhibition in the Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms where the Queen of the Tudor dynasty could wear it over 450 years ago.
The measure of this discovery is that only one more element of the 16th-century dress survived from the entire collection of royal dresses.
Although there is no evidence that Elizabeth ever wears that dress, three years of research will strengthen experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal dressing room.
"Sebrogols", incredibly expensive fabric, were legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and virtual lake quality of hatched plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflyes, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress belonged to the most prominent of people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
In addition, in the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt a threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals carrying such fine fabrics,” said Lynn.
"As a very important statement, I have asked a lot of people from the environment to look at the dress.
I really enjoyed the fact that when I saw the dress, they also enjoyed it and were practically convinced that we had a part of the royal wardrobe ahead of us.
Long, the life of the dress, cut to serve as altar fabric in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry was born, the closest Elizabeth the queen of the court, who served the queen for her long life and with which in local legends it was identified as the cloth.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to Parry's family or parish to Blanche's memory before she died in 1603.
After over a thousand hours of conservation work, four hundred of which were spent on the softest hand neck using specially painted silks and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go to the exhibition next to the loaned exhibition time by the Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous pictures of Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabric, it really begins to respect the craftsmanship of people who made it," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation works, most of which took place in a glass shop over at the place of Hampton Court, the only big enough place to accommodate some of the worthless gobelin palaces.
“ Looking at the front and behind, I began to feel a great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch confirmed the Polish rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday the Polish long-term rating in the foreign currency at "A-" level – in the Communication.
The perspective of the rating remained stable.
"Fitch Agency points to the strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-versified economy that is supported by a sound economic policy and a strong banking sector," reports the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the summit of the cyclical cycle and that between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of the national product Brutto in Poland would be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency expects that the general government deficit to remain below the limit of 3.3% and 1.9 percent respectively in the period 2020-2021.
“The ratio of general government debt to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, and in subsequent years will be less (mean of 48.3 percent over the period 2020-2021)”, we read.
Saving Poland
On 11 October, S&P and Moody's will be completed.
Poland’s rescue in its assessment of Fitch remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed the Polish rating at "A-" level with a stable perspective.
Of the three biggest credit rating agencies, Poland's credit credibility is the highest assessment of Moody's – at "A2" level.
Rating Poland according to Fitch and S&P is “A-”, one level lower than Moody's.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to assist investors in assessing the scale of their risk of investment activities.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Saving is nothing but a credit credibility assessment.
On her basis, he's making up his mind about who and how much money he can borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests who best to not give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
A lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
On the other hand, a higher risk is high interest on credit.
Any assessment must be justified and authorised.
Rating can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the world rating services market control three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
Confederate Five: First 1000 plus
"The fifth Confederate Friday" was the main foundation of the electoral programme, presented on Friday in Koszalina a candidate for a 40-year mandate from the KW Confederation of Freedom and independence.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, the Koszalin leader, presented the password "Fifeder's Fridays".
"First of all, a programme of 1000 plus for Poland, secondly fast and fair courts, third cultural vouchers and educational bones, fourth national security, after fifth is a healthy life", said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Polices must finally start making money," which is why the Confederacy wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the amount of tax free will solve itself".
"The Poles must be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and a voluntary ZUS for all", said the leader of the list about the assumptions of "the 1000 plus programme for Poland".
Aleksandra Zadenck, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the program password "healthy life" said that "living is increasingly poorer" and that should be changed, "supporting Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to act for free crops from GMOs.
As she said, the Confederacy also advocates the cessation of “stygmatisation of true hemps”.
Zadenko declared her support for the "development of construction using natural resources".
She also stated on behalf of her grouping for "free vaccinations".
"The right to informed consent must not be broken," she added.
Further candidates to the Sejm from the Koszalian district stressed that the Confederacy was a “indeed of a deep reform of the judiciary” which would be part of the handling of the case by the judge “day after day”.
They also claimed that the educational subsidy would go to schools without local authorities, i.e., without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederacy is also behind the "powerful Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates to Sejm stressed the need to increase the numbers of the army.
According to them, there is also a need for easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy deposits, we also need to consider going back to the idea of a nuclear power plant", said Piotr Karpiński.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind one-third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after the sunrise at the West Side in Chicago, CBS News reported an morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight from the drug-fighting office (DEA) showed in full light what was going on.
Last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantez, known simply as El Mencho.
“It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly to the US Federal executives,” said Matthew Donahue, head of the DEA agent in Mexico.
El Mencho's prize is worth $10 million.
He helped discover the dozens of drug labs of El Mencho in the jungle.
It belongs to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genacion, i.e. CJNG, who is responsible for at least one third of drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin contaminated fentanyl.
El Mencho's head has a reward of $10 million.
Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug-related charges, and eventually transferred to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, gun caliber 50.
In principle, he has his own SWAT teams", added Donahue.
El Mencho is punishing his empire by using measures such as the shooting of the Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or taking part in public hanging this summer.
Over the past few years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine bag lab, it's called a smuggler's brand.
For over one third of them, traces lead to El Mencho's cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "great chance" that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, says the French prosecutor.
The defendant assures that he has documents that compromise the Presidential couple.
He asked the Head of State, among others, EUR 300 000 in the Gothic state.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police says he received from a person employed in the Elisez Palace of the “explosion” documents.
During the hearing, he explained that these documents were not only compromised by the presidential couple, but that their disclosure could even threaten Macron's security and France's first lady.
In exchange for their return, he asked for EUR 300 000 – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from his previous marriage.
According to the D.A., the defendant refused to submit to the police the documents he was talking about.
He announced that he would pass it to the media – but it is not yet known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the review at the 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric examination, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders in him.
PS4 game will be oldsculova – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debuting soon game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony in the recent State of Play presentation announced that the Prime Minister of the Last of Us will be held in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breath-taking play with the upcoming action game.
More specifics were revealed in days after the loud premiere of the play fragment The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog go after old-school climates in many ways.
The last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Dradmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown to one of the widest games in history.
"The fabula is ambitious and has been involved in aspects where the only one was not" - he said.
She must have been so big that she could come forward with this kind of story with so many characters.
We didn't intend to create the most extensive game, that's just how it happened.
“We are elevated by how many possibilities there are in this story. There will be moments when you think you’re going to the end, but you will realize that this is only the beginning and that a whole new chapter begins” – says Drastrmann.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
It was otherwise revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two ageser eggi about adult content (information provided by Gamespot).
We will not spoil the surprises, but emerging in the game age eggi refers to Naughty Dog's old-school works.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on February 21, 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequel, reaching for the Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered from October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above-mentioned Naughty Dog production.
The PS Plus subscribers will also have access from October to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a pre-predominant order for sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-centimeter figure of this icon.
Run, scratch and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take the Podbeskid and want to win.
Stomila ballers from three queues are invincible.
Peter Z zajączkowski's followers won seven points at that time, because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnicka Chojnice, and in the last match there was a disarmament draw in Suwałki.
Now the Olsztyn band will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to Extraklasa.
The nearest Stomila rivals are fourth in the table and have a predominant point over the Olsztyn team.
The Podbeskid on trips this season played six times and won two victories, a draw and failure. Stomil is very well in his home – at the stadium at the Al. Piłsudska 69nd team Peter Z zająjkowski won three times and lost once.
In total, in ten lines, they gathered 17 points and were in the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the gameplay, nothing had said so.
"Every change needs time for results," explains Piotr Skiba.
“And finally something went wrong with us, and we believed in each other, except that we can work under normal conditions.
We were just focusing on the ball game.
They're clean heads, they're good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a powerful training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila was eliminated from the Polish Chorzów Movement Cup, but they needed to play games and a series of penalty shoots.
In the south of Poland, Peter Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to Poland, because coach Zajączkowski had rested to these key players before Saturday with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, the Chorzów played a return after the injury of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I’ve got it at such a time that we can continue to play in the cups (Mosakowski compared to 3:3 in 119 minutes - red.).
Dad used to bite me a lot, and he laughed I couldn't get a goal, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wasn't expecting it."
Now Mosakowski counts to return to the basic composition, especially because he can't play Ołuh Tarasenko because of his yellow cards.
"I'm working hard on training so I can play in the first composition," says Mosakowski.
“ In Chorzów, I did everything I could to present myself as best I could.
But whether I play or sit on the reserve bench, I'll be just as hard to support the band.
Because the team's most important and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
I'm sure there's a hard meeting where the victory is going to be running, snoring and fighting."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz, who has recently also suffered trauma, we will find out only on Saturday, even more so that the coach Zącezkowski traditionally tried to keep the personnel a secret until the end of the case.
A man raped and murdered a niece
“You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
A 5-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Its search lasted five days until Whipple showed the place to hide the body.
"How could someone have done this to his own niece?" said Dejay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give everything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of a murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same," added a devastated woman.
As Fox News informs, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the hearing.
Last month he admitted he kidnapped, sexually used it and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client was raised in a "unreal family."
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to suffer punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without a chance to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will hand over nearly $100 million additional resources to the communities affected by the drought.
The programme to provide money to affected farmers will be extended and the allocation criteria for farm additives will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million in support for affected communities, so that eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in emergency situations.
Each of the 13 local state-owned areas under the programme of assistance to affected communities will receive up to 1 million grants for infrastructure and assistance in coping with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than 7 billion dollars from the government to the drought fund.
Frostpunk - a strategic game combining the features of emotional-builder production with the unique simulator of the 19th-century society and the frozen survival – is approaching the planned 11th October premiere on the consoles.

An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Silesian Bakers
A personal test was carried out prior to the electoral meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Silesian Bakers.
"Dear ladies and gentlemen, louder, we will not welcome your prime minister here!
The Ma-te-us!", advising the leaders hard.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiasm officer did not deliver the expected result.
The election campaign in progress.
Politicians ride all over the country, persuading voters together.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is the leader of the Silesian list of PiS, is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is well planned, including appropriate repairs.
It was also, rather, supposed to be, in the Silesian Bakers.
The special guest should be especially greeted.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the current executives decided to carry out a general test.
Like an elusive leader, he tried to encourage a crowd to run the name of the government's boss.
"This will not be a greeting to me, only for your Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
And louder, louder my dear ones!" he encouraged the dissipated.
Unfortunately, the crowd has not been fully kidnapped by the hot - hearted and reluctantly responded to the “Ma-the-us” but recording of the enthusiastic waterer makes the furry on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of the murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay's house on 9 July 2014, requesting his wife's whereabouts to be disclosed, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened fire, as Sheriff Harris said.
Only one family member survived, then Cassidy Stay, 15 years old.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of misreadability.
The jury's gonna meet again on Monday to give judgment.
Quantum Internet getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army research results are moving the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of time retention not available at traditional network creation approaches.
A centre for the Spoiled Quantum Processing of Information of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Capacity The U.S. Army was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, which was able to achieve a record transfer of the status of the converged between the matter and the light – at a distance of 50 kilometres with the use of light cables.
The confusion is the correlation that can arise between quantums such as cobits.
When two units are sealed and measured one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the measurements made on the other, even if the other bitbit is physically remote.
"This [50 km] is two rows further than it was previously possible and this is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks", said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, which was published in the Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intermittent quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of physical kubit networks, which are bound together despite high physical distances.
Researchers have found that this dispersion of the state of confusion is necessary for the creation of a quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a huge step forward to achieve a large-scale scattered state", said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-organizing military support programme.
The quality of the second condition, after passing the light, is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
With the help of laser beams, researchers have entered a quantum state in ion, simultaneously stimulating it to emit photons in which quantum information was saved.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fibre cable.
"The phototon emitted by ion calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the light" said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team initially sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser radiation.
The photon wavelength has been converted to an optimal value from a long distance point of view – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon over a 50-km fibre cable.
Their measurements show that atoms and particles of light were still confused even after the wavelength was changed and the distance passed.
‘A calcium choice decision means that this result is a direct way for the creation of a complex network of nuclear clocks at large physical distances, as calcium can be associated with a high-quality set of ‘the clock’.
The army is very interested in large-scale complex clock networks, due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military investigator who also co-organizes the program.
