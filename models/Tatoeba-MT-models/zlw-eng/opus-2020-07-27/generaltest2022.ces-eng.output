A great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel the Frenchman was called to NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a tough period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
The 13-year-old pedagogue will be on the pedagogue, and soon he could get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper Litvínova, Plzně or Russian Čeljabinsk injured in the preparations for the NHL in October this year.
In exactly half the game with Vegas was sobered and since then he has not presented himself at NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
“Pavel The Frenchman will be out of three to four weeks with a lower body injury,” announced the Denver whole at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time was called from a farm where he took four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL he added 94.5% of the advances.
The adulterer of the Plzen Hockey wants to finally settle and confirm that it belongs to the world's best leagues.
In his last year he had problems with hips, and in a reduced pandemic year, he did not get away with a single game.
In the NHL "France" took 36 hits, and its success rate is 92.3%.
Charles on Christmas wish put Camille's robes, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas wish selected family photography taken during the journey to Jordan.
He also published his wish to be a prince of Charles, who used a photograph on which his husband Camille helps to wear a cover.
On her website she informed the British news station BBC.
They send requests to friends, co-workers, and to the superstitions they cooperate with.
Photographs were created somewhere in the desert landscape.
Duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dress in khaki color and dress has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same as Prince George and Louis shorts and T-shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photo, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when it was created.
Last year, the royal family for photography used to pose as a Christmas wish as a pack of straw in front of a pile of wood in her country mansion in Norfolk County.
The dream, which serves as a Christmas wish, also published the successor to Prince Charles's throne with her wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June on racing in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and on his face's cap, helps Camille put on her cap in colour with light clothes.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million for the title, the tough guy denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption kauze allegedly worked with the fact that the defendant of the former Vice-President of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was supposed to have one million crowns of the league title in the 2018/19 season from Prague.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about it getting to some of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Jaroslav Hardík, said that the red and white were not allowed any corruption negotiations.
The server published a transcript of police listenings from Slavie, mainly her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship last summer.
According to the file, a more powerful red-white officer was frequently contacted both with Berbra and the former sports director of the then secondary school of Roman Rogoz Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra promised her financial reward when she received the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) is to be held for winning in the league from SK Slavia Praha's officers promised a million-dollar bribe, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbra met not only with Nezmar, but also with Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slavie Hardík.
According to the server file, it is no longer true whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claim of any corruption has been rejected.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively tried to change the ratios in Czech football and offered a opponentic alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal negotiations, we have not sought to influence referees contrary to fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context," said the applicant for the List of Reports.
In listening, among other things, Nemmar does not embracing some former players of Slavie's dark skin and also speaks to his old boss, the tough guy.
The rubber reported influence of the matches through referees began police intervention in several places last mid-October, including the FACR headquarters.
The highest built in the afrea is Berbr, which is no longer configured in any of the football functions.
In the middle of January he was as much as the former sports director of the Vyšehrad Rogoz released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are lling cold wars.
They will be new, but essentially worse type (the gunmen must be out of the armored cabin and carry the bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, they managed to get rid of Pragy V3S even in specialised units.
Flights: fighting- decent, but at the end of rental, transport - too small with short flight, but modern.
Drony - few and only small types without fighting potential
Missiles - we have none (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short reach - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story.
I'm right next to town.
There was a nutria coming out of the river and doing the damage on the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the side of the river.
I didn't want to do a mess, so I sat down quietly, and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before anything came out, but, of course, she went for a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, waved his head all over, so I called him and said it was on the fox.
By the time I got off the bus, he was gone.
I mean, even a man's meadow was a puser.
On the other hand, it's not war, it'd have to be a match of a lot of coincidences to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermos that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, the precious things take dates to your feet to sleep and you should be fine.
Soldiers versus Hamáček.
Vnitro got the respondents much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for purchasing and distribution of peacocks, masks and resergators for the profession closest to coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks to their acquisition.
The server and the Communication compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts to the respirator were different by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have been acting in the economy?
And why else were they buying irritating?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to the server editor and the Radio Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I am not affected by memories of the ČSLA, which have passed the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can take care of training, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, plus modern technology is always more complex, so the ability of the crews will rapidly waste time.
Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, will take place very quickly, will not be able to train someone again.
And in the end, players/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where they are going to lead a mass Geril, and it is also a worded necessity to dissuade the enemy.
The Czech Republic will only fight in the conflict of such scope and intensity, where Gerila will be irrelevant, and we have no appropriate geography to do so.
Mostly, we don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them play like they have it.
Then you come up with a situation like you're looking like a loser who hasn't hit the empty gate in two minutes, and he's in attacking himself between two or even three splinters and saying, "Wow, what do you think is gonna happen now?"
Well, of course, they're gonna pick him up like an average tax payer.
The situation with this shilling "circumct the defender" is so terrible that I'm surprised to be honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to rob one player of the opponents.
First Flags
The Covid pandemic slows down, however, experts for the following weeks do not expect a major revolution.
The advantage in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and the pandemic equation has arrived as known, new unknown: the variant of omikron, which is very likely to spread faster than the current ruling Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, as much as it helps vaccination or post-stinction immunity obtained by the previous treatment of the disease.
However, this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered a weekly equation: treatment option.
New drug, antivirotic molarupiravir has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be added to the drug paxlide from Pfizer, which reports from previous results even 85 percent success.
The first delivery of molarupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against coronavir pandemic, has highlighted also the question of how the local administration’s medicines are prepared for incoming.
As it was said, the first person to get molarupiravir to domestic patients is Merck.
The company ended up on tape as the first and only because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic broke out in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease horses on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often forgotten that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less openly and openly do not share their views.
In turn, Eastern Europeans, and in particular, we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew".
See if you can do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and vote the sides as the AfD.
They're afraid of the cancel culture, saying this in public is a loss of work and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the recon, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that objects are in Czech three and completely identical.
It's identical for the reason the troops spin units so that they don't have to learn where they are again, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, sssr didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory, either because of the safety or speed of deployment due to the wester position.
In these underground covers (in each map there are two) only warheads, not all of the rockets as they say.
If it was necessary to load this weapon, there was a special unit that picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Besides, museum maple, they're all desolated.
At the second level of primary school, we had a classmate, Cigán, four years we were with him.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was our mascot.
He used to have fun with him all the time, he went out and wanted to explain something, he didn't have enough, he walked on a regular basis, he spent sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he went straight away.
He drove school in nature, made various monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, civilians entered the same year, another class.
Shortly on that, they beat up a teacher, and they often addressed something to the police, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell something to the ad (old things, something I don't need, etc) and I sell often to the Cigians, the money has always had, have not tried to drag me into price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, and a guy called in a month, and he's already transferred it to himself.
I'm saying about myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, until they act as they belong in a decent society (work, work, work, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, he raises his hand, puts out the apartments and houses, has just a mess around him, makes trouble, so it's the same thing as his color, but it's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn language (not necessarily English, at least), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
Young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticka
“A young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation, unfortunately, she had been able to do so,” said Zuzana Fajtl’s spokesperson to the law.
Hawaii probably caused a driver to drive a girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from Žíchovec to Bavaria, and from the undetected causes he left in the corner to the counterroad.
After the collision with Škou Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof outside of the truck, described an accident by the spokesperson of the South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarz.
The young driver of Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a multiple injury, and it was stuck in the car.
After the release he had to have been provided with acute pre-departure care and in stable condition he was transported to the Czech State Hospital, a rescue officer called Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a mild chest injury and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data on them
Luke Neuheisl is ordering from abroad several times a month.
He's mainly buying collection cards.
"It usually could be tens of dollars, say, ten dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free," says the collector.
Since October, he has been treated slightly for small consignments, and the new VAT must be added and the post office must transmit data to the customs procedure.
He comes in with an e-mail message that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is sufficient to fill out the information on the consignment, and if VAT has not already included the trader in the sale, the customs office shall determine it from the total amount for the consignment and for transport.
Where the address is not covered by the customs procedure itself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna close one or two of the inside boxes, put two attachments in, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are able to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of consignments received from abroad from 60,000 to 15 thousand has decreased to the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to the calls for data delivery that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There's currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people were to fill all the data that is needed, and fill them in time, we would be here about half, says the spokesperson of the Czech Post, Matyaš Vitík.
Solution for inflation
See the headline, how would you propose the solution to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow this growth down or compensate?
Do we see, in Poland, a reduction in the VAT on food and pH, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it goes?
Prices are growing faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much do you need to be added (who is an employee)?
I've been added 2% this year in a gross laugh, but luckily I have a similar income from business that I'm working on.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convictions of rapists are only sent for six months?
This head just doesn't take my head. How can a court send a man like that for six months just to do it again when he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And not to mention, the rape victim never has to recover again.
Can this even prevent a potential future rape report from this?
A man from Hroba "slept" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man of the grave was unintentionally helping the guards to secure his fully sought girlfriend from Kosomlat, on which he was given a warrant to arrest.
He called them himself to her.
He went around with a detour.
First, he reached out to the passer and came up with a story that he was robbed.
After the call on the distress line, the officers didn't have enough to wonder when the alleged "cold" said he had come up with all this to make sure that the officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to report to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, then the officers discovered that a woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a national search, and there is a warrant for her arrest.
The case is therefore addressed by the PCC.
A honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I personally think that we are not ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, it's a pity that Churchill failed to ensure the release of Prague to the United States :'.
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite the question of whether a rational person can actually believe anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree here with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods then has one to choose?
I would say that it is likely that there is at least one god in any of these thousands of religions who will punish you in vain if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments, there is no other god than Jahveh.
Wouldn't it be more rational to keep faith in any god than to risk that I choose badly from these thousands of gods, and that one true god that I didn't just hit, send me to hell or to some place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar to that.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per week) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you're doing well, you can get a professional offer.
It would be good for all components of the AČR to do something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: The continuous mix of cooperation between the educational sector and industry, the companies fishing in schools, and there is some kind of prognosis in which the labour force emigrates from educational institutions into working conditions.
Not only does it grow up, but this process is ongoing, each of us constantly learning something new, it will go from one field to another, etc.
A similar gap between civil and military sectors should work.
I also see this as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. institutions that guarantee that Russians, Germany, or the Mongolia raider will never interfere with this.
I find it funny how you consider NATO something cast into the stone, we have allies, and then they will defend us if there's a problem.
Oh, my God.
One choice in the U.S. is enough to break their budget and all of NATO's going into the cunt.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russia's gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once that they only have to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long worked as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population that can control military technology of its time.
And today she can pilot remote-controlled funds every teenager can't do.
We don't need border fortification, it's a fart today, but a little teenager who's got a knipl of remote control equipment will be able to handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You pack presents under a Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home wrapped up in boxes and fillings?
This “waste” re-use e-shops missing from packaging materials.
That's why there's a map of shops that welcome your used boxes.
And that's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone in agreement can bring to the involved trade (map of the KAMSNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overheated blue containers.
Trade itself welcomes the packages currently lacking in the market and also the money saved, because the packaging box has healed by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmental-thinking customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are called on to us in Popůvek at Brno's car, but also the companies with whom we have arranged regular rides of discarded boxes.
We'll use everything to pack packages from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierry.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only the collection sites for packaging material.
They serve as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where you remove the sorted waste from the household, where you submit the past drugs, tyres, developed electronics, batteries, light sources, large-scale waste, etc.).
So all the garbage can end up in the right place, plus re-use things will find their second home.
The total project map contains over 100,000 such sites.
"The collection courts, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity houses, SWAPs and other places to help find applications for things that would otherwise become waste" adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklid Czech Society.
I find it difficult to think that technology is so simple and stupid these days that children who use a computer or phone are playing games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
There has recently been a problem (mainly in English articles) that students of universities do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because for example Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones will simply hide the underlying filesystem file system with all the files, and it will turn on one screen in the app.
I mean, you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, I mean, I don't want them to use the technique since they were kids, but I want them to learn.
Let's read history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the Presidency's logo, called for protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that are not to be reached in six months.
French politicians do, but they like it, and so do the voters.
Macron's protrusions between the right and the left match little, but it does in Europe.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of the state in April.
The electoral calendar affected the priorities itself.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is prepared to create conditions for such works of historians.
A number of commentators have come up immediately with criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, it's trying to defend history.
The country’s right-wing candidate for the French President Éric Zemmmour is currently encamping France with the theory that the Vicha regime, which, during the Second World War, collided with Hitler, was not so bad, and it has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and let's not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries have lost their history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs, learn who has defeated in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened office, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mys" didn't win.
The story that goes back to Srebrenica in 1995 also won the award for the regime and for the best actress, Jasna Duricčová.
At this year's Carlovar Festival, he was held on the first places of the viewer's ladder.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for his father's movie.
I'm not very young, I'm not healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "the flu / being sick" for a few days I had diarrhoea and didn't like to smoke too much...
It was worse than normal flu.
I don't have any diarrhoea at the flu.

Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double, published on 20 December, will contain the traditional literary attachment.
And with her, they'll come up with cultural tips.
Those priests we add to you for this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to provide books as Christmas gifts.
Prozaic texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of watching the world and a description of everyday things with unscrupulous poetry, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Sixák tried to capture the essence of small towns and Czech companies.
A story about going back to the roots that turns out to be just longed for illusions.
The divinity and comaratist are passing the story about the red carbula to the stage of the current village.
Its administration through brutality overcomes the folk version and is in the horror of emotional emptiness.
And the way back to instincts is shorter than you are willing to admit.
The author in his last novel talks about a rather less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we used to listen.
Those who remained, and those who left, know too little about themselves to put it into a common life.
Trains are starting to ride according to the new timetable, somewhere to be changed by carriers
From Sunday they start to ride trains according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain lines, for example between Ústím nad Labem and Kolín, where the place of the Czech Drah begins to ride RegioJet.
For most lines, only the time of departure will be adjusted, if necessary slightly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started to sell tickets in the fall.
The Czech Railways plan to operate daily on average 6783 passenger transport connections in the new timetable, of which will be a daily average of 478 motorway trains.
Trains are driving about 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The tracks next to national connections under the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains that will ride from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be issued by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will traditionally increase the fares from next year, on average, by 3.2 percent.
The paths take inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJetu timetable is the entry to the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the Czech Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will manage 16 connections on the track daily, eight in each direction.
Further changes relate to remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two return connections in Slovakia, as well as weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain, despite planned eviction, also the most similar driving times of its long distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier shall also be replaced in certain regional lines.
The changes await passengers for example in the Czech Republic, where on the line from Mladá Boleslavi to Czech Lipa to Rumburk they will be driving trains by Trilex by the German company Die Länderbahn instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a single railway ride for the second year.
As in the Czech Way, their price will be increased by 3,2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Do we not learn to look the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights as they were oppressed and they had to work, die.
I've never heard a teaching from the point of view of a slave party or from then on, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one will ever tell you in school that blacks often sold blacks into slavery themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, only to tell you how brutally we, Europeans, murdered while killing each other a long time ago.
I've also spent some time in the United States, directly at schools, both in the north and in the south.
I didn't meet up with the fact that someone was planning to shut down the facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (in Japan, there's a pretty taboo from WW2).
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History isn't interested in anyone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without a look at things these days.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, since we've already been to those Southern states, yes, Confederate flags and famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand they also had some good successes, and I find it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, Sever was not much better than enough people today to idealize him.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in South was slavers and they had a lot of problems against them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately skip some facts, lie and manipulate, in addition to our view with them (the video was also from the TV, where someone who started talking about our legaries and 1968).
What came to me in the U.S. schools ridiculously was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never happened to their country.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities it was a terrible thing, the students were very betrayed, and these schools supported them as many times as possible.
And if I imagine these people going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of most people because they're young and also in a ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long had what he had, and it is no longer about the same, has betrayed himself.
At present, feminist names are referred to as those who have nothing in common with him and ignores the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other hand, where it often leads to resistance to some pretty reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone gets, the more it gets to hear.
Anyway, at the end, I didn't see anyone judging me for colonism or slavery either.
More like I met the wrong title, but it was bilateral :D
Not because I don't like this place, but because I think it's completely immeasurable.
I'm supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of personal identity.
If something happens to people, it's about interests, views of the world, and experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not believers, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he's more of a talk about theology than politics, but then he's always going to fuck up some hangover about cocotine about coronavirus that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, the Church of Czechoslovakian Hussite is here.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholic without Popes.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the gods to the hussites because they're very much like theologically, but mostly members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michal on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 a.m. doing Mass in Latin, like she did before Vatican II.
Betlém's flame is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flames blessed in Bethlehem, where, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, are in the Czech Republic.
Skauti took him for a pandemic of coronavir, but this time they didn't go to Vienna, took him from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav.
She was taken and taken across the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in each other's section every year, I look forward to it too much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, to tell present journalists the Scout Amalia Budíková.
While the transfer took place last year at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the transfer of Reintal – Břeclav to the parking lot.
Usually, a scout drives a train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes to the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
With the betlemian light, the scouts had traditionally taken the train to Brno, where they would hand it over to the die bishop of Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, 18 December, the Scoutic couriers, who will travel with selected speeds and passenger trains, will take care of the subsequent distribution of light.
They will take the light from them at the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
Skauti must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavir this year.
It's like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the local event organizers, to carry the worms, to try to follow the distance, to keep them as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to act as safe as possible, to describe the speakers of the Betlemian Light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Betlemite light that travels to Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread simultaneously with the burning of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
Bethlehem’s light is for the faithful signs of hope, the light that overcomes the darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event stands at hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of indifference and human interdependence.
All news, including the list of places people can come for the flames, can be found on www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that the subsidy to cancer economy, but I don't think the subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will use this money properly, but I don't understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million volumes of "xy funded/co-financed by xy" project, and such a company is simply artificially kept in life.
This isn't the company's support that gives work x people, this is the dawning of development when this company is holding up and taking orders/employment to companies that could grow up after her death and be more productive.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even the person who was born in the Internet will also get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think Internet advertising will move with me, but then I'll find that I've been influenced by it either - it's just so tweaked that you don't always get rid of it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to give a total ban on programming (= targeted) ads...
It's all bullshit, words of classics - I would ban the Internet.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not gonna believe something that most believe and makes sense, I'm not really a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion about which I'm going to say it's critical thinking"
2. "I will not believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has gone through the trend of Christmas movies, the premieres of it this year have two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinema, television station and streaming platform in the United States and other English speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas films and this year they will be presented to their viewers in the premium to more than two hundred.
This was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years by the audience has reached points and significantly increases the ratings, therefore more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the pictures that have the word Christmas ( Christmas) in its name, so actually it will be many more holiday movies.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic, there are especially fairy tales associated with this period, around the world are also popular to take pictures of yourself at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom of Christmas shots started in 2009 when the special film series came to America's Hallmark cable television station, he reminded the BBC server.
Its advent project called Countdown to Christmas (received by Christmas) included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station has begun to ride its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime Station has 35 new Christmas films this year, and its favourite streaming platforms like Netflix contribute to the total sum.
“In this magic period, it doesn’t matter much about the story, it’s important that there’s plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that they snow,” described this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be home for Christmas movies).
“For the audience it is a form of escape and a way to at least two hours to feel a little calm in the middle of all this holiday madness and madness of the world in which we live for the last few years,” Gray added.
For example, he says that Hallmark is still using the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that seems to be resolved and those two will kiss.
That's how it all goes around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, complement Gray.
Mazepine had a positive text on covid-19, he's not going to hit the final race F1.
Only 19 riders will go to Abu's Great Price.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not hit the last season race.
Stáj Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the last season's race, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th place he went out in his qualifications.
But the Rus Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable is not going to hit the Great Price of Abu.
He was positive for covid-19.
Thus, only 19 cars appear on the starter route, from the last stop will go to the Mazepin teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen to the title in a direct battle with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is quite well, according to the expression of the Haas stable and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, while security will be the final priority for all stakeholders," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He can't send a spare rider to the Haas race, he can't.
An alternative substitute would have to pass the qualifications or rides on another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not touch the first racer.
At the start of the currently ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had a covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, and last year they were positively tested by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The most expensive sweater amazes!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work into it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to do, but little experience in our home was never much to carry,” says Lebanon, who spent 3000 hours over his work in six months.
Hedvábí bought 24-carat gold yarn in France and 2000 decorative crystals delivered Swarowski.
Silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The foundation is wool and cotton, but the silk adds the silk sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And it's got one more hook.
"I am completely broke, I must sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, stood "only" CZK 720 000.

The government has approved the sending of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of NATO states in the context of several months of the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime which, within its territory, invite citizens of Middle East countries with false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in Polish territory.
The mutation of Omikron spread to the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's running another case of Adam's baby.
“We are now reported further suspicions of this variant in Adam’s next child, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZS Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the county last week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variants in our six cases – the National Reference Laboratory for Fluid and Influenza virus in Prague,” said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one department of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two more 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There's no connection between the cases from Brno and Adam's.
Three of them, according to the Director, have mild symptoms, four no sign of course.
No one suspected of Omikron to travel abroad.
None of these have traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor have any contact with anyone abroad.
Relation with the championship in the water pole is none of the listed, said Ciupek.
The main hygiene girl Pavel Svrčinová had previously stated that an international tournament in the waterfield was being screened several weeks ago in Brno.
There were players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player was ill after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act as Texas in the ban on abortions.
The Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the country's most humanly state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in his controversial legislation against abortions after detection of the heart artery.
People should then be entitled to compensation in prosecuting anyone who manufactures or sells attack rifles and armaments produced by firearms in California.
The Newsome notification responded to the fifth US Supreme Court, which left the Texas ban on abortions in force, as it was against almost 50 years of old precedent, which set the right to miscarriage in the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question that results from the innovative design of the measures.
The enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, making it impossible for the Texas to attack the ordinary court.
“I am beaten by yesterday’s (relationary) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained, and to a large extent supported the Texas Maneuvre to protect its law,” said the California governor.
"If the States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will apply this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
The subordinates said that they should work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Justice Minister on measures that would justify public representatives to enforce the ban on violent rifles and so-called weapons of ghosts.
This is how weapons produced by a petite who do not have serial numbers and can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to have a "private citizen" right to require a compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and a court order from anyone who makes, distribute or sells attack rifles, parts to "defence of ghosts" or sets for their production.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets is to create a threat to private action, then we should do exactly that,” said the California Governor.
The AP states that California has banned the production and sale of certain weapons of military style for decades, but in June, the federal judge of the country has blocked the ban as anti-avoidable.
If the state would now actually renew the ban by using the Texas templates, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in an unagreed opinion on the fifth majority verdict, would be warned before extending the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas did not grant complete immunity to the judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their action against selected South States officials.
Each emergency vaccination stage has its public test phase where it gradually comes up to see what the vaccination schedule will look like and to improve the vaccine itself on the basis of results.
Izrael, for example, is already in a big four-dose study.
And according to these studies, most patients have had a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other vaccination, he's gonna have his vaccination schedule in time, it's just too soon for that to happen.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the specifications of the manufacturer, is expected to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it had taken advantage of the new powers and would have stopped Poland's payment of money due to a legal state.
The Commission has already delayed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the pandemic covidu-19.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies to countries breaking the principles of the rule of law.
"The Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU in all matters which require unanimity," said Ziobro, Head of Solidar Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a tight majority in Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be fair for the EU to deny our funds from the common budget, as we also contribute, to the Polish Minister.
His party in access to the EU takes more radical positions than the ruling party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes that have passed through Polish justice for Zirorov threaten its independence and make it subject to policies.
According to Ziobra, Brussels builds “the impossible conditions, because its objective is not the rule of law, but the change of the government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing the “political dictate by extortion and the attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” said Ziobro.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never come to such concessions as Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be restricted.
"We will never agree that Poland should have its status as a colony," he said.
But to learn about it... in Lidlu they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't watch other things, I met one yoghurt many times, I needed only cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelf, and I asked.
They had him, that's true, in the narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lute zone...
If it's off, I don't even smell, action no matter what, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have a choice there, but they usually have everything I need, and it's got some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lido to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
Two years I've been watching how it is with data like manure, most of the opponents of vaccination is just a little bit beyond the bowl of vaccination advocates.
Rational discussions are held at expert level, but extreme opinions are being reached in public space.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination with us sleeps, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, let everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples with pears.
This one's got it this way, and we've got it this way.
But that data collection methodology is different in these two countries.
Ugh, I had a good time.
Sorry for the ride and have a nice day with you all.
In my childhood, they punished me with a quartz.
It was never because of the stamps, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (I read instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened to do it again, so I'm going to get the punch (although I'm not even going to bring up another "buttering" only to lay it down and lay it down to see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few shots on my ass (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and extent) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than in words.
I think the part with the warning is important because it gives the child in his way to choose whether he will listen and receive, or he will get better, and there will be no punishment.
In the end, I usually only had a warning to begin to listen.
System Protection
When an important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cep responded to a journalistic question in 1999, what does the Czech constitution mean for him – whether the sacred leaf, on which he swears and which he learns from at school, or on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed, was definitely attached to the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are and its citizens are, and with changes it is better to save.
Imagine: some nations even like their rules.
As Czechs like to have pork and green dumplings, he raised the question of Vojtěch Cepl at that time.
In recent times, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs changes is becoming increasingly common among lawyers.
This summer is tested by situations which its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl owned) could not predict, for example, with the conduct of the President's elected.
But Ceppl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political intervention in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to managing the majority of the crises that society meets throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of governance, which consists of different rules, which lay down the policies of the mantiel of the game.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we associate policies with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno fight for the life of a couple of months's baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is more mild to children, there are also difficult cases that the hospitals have been dealing with lately.
“We know that children are at risk and affected by less than adults, 2 to 5 percent are spoken compared to adults,” said the Newer Mayor of Children’s Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine Petr Dominik.
The course is much easier, easier, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are ill with coronavirus, which we see especially during the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
That's what's going on at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Very serious children with coronavirus have been at ARU lately.
Children with postcovidial syndromes were continuously separated by a physician throughout the year.
“Now the increase in children with acute covid pneumonia is the pneumonia of the lungs that requires a stay on the resuscitation bed,” he said and added that this disease interferes with adults as well as adults and several months of babies.
In hospitals there are also children in hard condition due to coronavir.
"We currently have a child of a few months and adolescent age," said the primary.
It is, of course, pleased that no children have been killed in the FN Brno children’s hospital until now.
According to the available data, 6 December was the death of six children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominican Republic, there is an integral part of the cooperation between psychologists in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points out that, as in adults, vaccination in children reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovidial syndrome.
“For this, the vaccine dose is recommended for children,” added the doctor.
You can only walk in a quiet zone in marked ways.
But the rest zone isn't that big.
You can see the tourist map on map.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the peaceful zone, you can go anywhere (but don't go through the fence to the obory).
Skiing/riding bikes in the forest outside the marked path must not be provided unless you have an exception (but, of course, it does not care so much outside national parks).
How's the conductor doing?
Music is in my head. Josef Kurfiřt is laughing.
He is a well-feared liberal opera and was originally played on a forest corner.
As a singer can sing practically all repertoire and act as conductor not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šaldy, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the castle of the Philharmonia, with the film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonosian symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of managed diseases and the fact that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China builds the impression of managed diseases and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone to medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing rejected criticism for failing to stop the disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors are often helping to combat coronavirus, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing's willingness?
Is this a friendly support or a communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, don't you want a elephant?"
I got it and it's awesome.
My wife's happy to, because she's saving her weed, she's gonna wash the car with a ocbot, kids playing with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell those elephants.
My friend, let's get on with it, it's gonna be great...
After a while, they meet, and the guy who bought them complains, "Hey, dude, what did you sell for elephant?
The lawn's blown up, the giant shit, the car's dissipated, the kids are fighting him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold it says, "You don't talk about the elephant, you don't sell the elephant like that...
World events are controlled by the powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is true, it is the greats that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a powerful one if it works on its integration.
This has yet to operate at the level of economic and political (in selected matters), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is headed for federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there will be other moods and it will work out.
I thought about it, too, and it's possible.
I'm not a Czech expert, so maybe I'll just say it.
I'm just saying that ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spain Oranges and Mandarins" when it is clear that it is both from Spain, whereas in "Spain Fruit and Mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I assume that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to further specify it with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say "D."
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of the Mexican Milly
Scary shots show the moment when the scared monkey was screaming in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner broke her down and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also feeds sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her animal breeding, informed her of The Sun's journal.
Experts in rehab who are taking care of Milla after her abuse have said that they have never seen such a fearful cosmos.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitated at Monkey World's staff in Dorset, and now she is happy to play with another saved monkey named Moon.
The fourth mother confessed to two accusations of unnecessary suffering from a protected animal.
At the Magistrate's court in Gwent, she was sentenced to a 12-week sentence of freedom with conditional deferral for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on livestock farming and must pay 12 000 crowns of court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the affected animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further.”
Milly took her time to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid from anyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and satisfied with the male, her view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars of abuse will be accompanied forever, adds Sawyer.
Tackling Milly came out after the Gwent P.D. discovered horrific footage of a woman's phone in her apartment for drug charges.
On the footage, you can hear Milly vulgárny broadcasting.
The next video tells us how Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43) she admitted to holding cocaine with her intention to sell it.
There was cocaine found in her house for £600 (in the conversion of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland received a conditional sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this right three times after you're bravely jumping the whole 20th century?
Like, you're gonna take the same stuff in your first grade?
And it's all killing the idea of bifling when no one, the honor of exception, doesn't matter if you can or you understand.

Go and ask people randomly on the street to determine the nature of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross it, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning about?
I'm a huge fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it in.
It's part of learning for a lot of people who need that thing.
But like, that note that you really don't need all this on your machine, I meant absolutely seriously because you don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point of not knowing is the sign of punk.
(What appears to be part of our communist past and angry against education and elites) Of course, the price of our machines being made to become barbarists is simply high.
If the journalists were able to count, then covid's probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first glance: The war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave now," Andrea replied to the Instagram in Stories to the questions of curious fans, which disappointed her so that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
It's been working between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move behind her, i.e. until he returned to Bohemia for ever.
But she denied it resolutely.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only ended in love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack! He got upset with Kadi's turnover in response to Andre's accusations on lies, gambling and debt.
The remarkable sincerity of Kada's ex-wife no longer liked his little sister Linda.
That's what my brother decided to stop publicly.
Normally, I don't talk to this thing at all, and in my family, we've never even said too much extra to each other.
I definitely don't want to make some regrets.
But when I see someone who's trying to publicly hurt and pick up the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry I have to do this on this journey, but I would like to thank my brother Kadria publicly for making a character of myself and helping our family when we needed it most even though he was young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that is likely to be out of context.
I would like to know Kadi as much as I do, our close and family, in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what they write, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him over everything, and we know the reality, and we know how it really was, put it indeterminately.
The drunk thief came up on the facade to the fifth floor.
You're not gonna believe what it's for.
He started his robbery expedition in the parking lot of a residential neighborhood where he tried to enter several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually alienated less than CZK 330 in the conversion from one vehicle.
Then he didn't think any better than climb up the 5th floor and walk into the apartment in an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The shot from one security camera is then caught walking down the street away from the crime scene and eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
That's when Ccha stopped.
A man admitted to drinking alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still in the investigation.
The monkey climbed up the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effective in relation to the pandemic emergency.
If this is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Isn't that enough for a reason?
The right to gather will be limited, but not cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think all this stuff that people write to you right here.
You're just playing a fool to have a fight with who.
If not, it's sad.
I do not claim that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (after all, the aim was to make them look good).
And I don't give a damn who believes in it.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church has had in the Middle Ages, how much money it has recorded, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday at night a man in Ostrava, who was invading rescue workers of regional health care services.
The personnel of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight emergency calls with initial information about the fall of a man from height.
Two ZZS crews, medical and medical personnel, went to the site immediately.
On arrival at the hospital, the seven-year-old man was supposed to fall off a window from an altitude of about 12 metres and reach his head on concrete!
Coal's been caught in the victim's quarters.
But not as it should, and firemen went into the event.
At the time of arrival of the rescue service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct dangers of life.
The intervener involved his respiratory pathways, secured artificial pulmonary ventilating and after further measures within the pre-neutral care of his sanitary vehicle carried him to further care of the Ostravian trauma center, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
More fear than I have from the coronavirus from inadequate public reactions and authorities
The enlargement of coronavir in the Czech Republic means a call for policy and officials, but the health doctors and healthcare professionals are in line with the first line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Olivia defends the belt
The MMA has experienced a great galaxy full of interesting results.
There were things going on at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová has been able to defeat the legendary warrior Amanda Nunes, who hasn't been found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate to lightly, demonstrated against Dustin Poiier a great strangulation and defend the belt.
The victory also recorded Kai Kara-France, who quickly passed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise like no one expected.
That's what brought the women's bantam struggle between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peno.
The American entered each other's battles as a thoughtful "trap," Nunes didn't win seven years, and she cut off her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey behind the victory very actively and the opponent even delivered a push kick, which she sent her to the ground.
However, Penelope did not allow herself to make any more mistakes, and herself failed to attempt to attack with levers on her hand.
The second round was moving, and for fans, MMA was very stretchy.
Both rivals were time by many excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got on the ground where she started cutting her.
She must have given up her efforts and knocked the attack off.
The American was so shocked when she became a new champion.
The top of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a title in a lightweight.
At first, although Poirier managed better, the card gradually started to turn.
In the latter, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who the opponent tried to put a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he created a lot of pressure, he got opponents on his back and put him in a series of wounds.
That's the second round he won.
In the third round of Olivia, he showed rear naked choke, whom Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to knock off.
The Brazilian thus defends the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match he wrote a sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who was already on Raulian Paiva with a hard right back.
He subsequently reached it with a number of precise strikes and recorded fifteen triumphs.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now she lost seven years.
That hip, or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech express only one grammatical family, and therefore there is no difficulty in determining whether they are male, female or middle.
Then there is also a relatively large group of essential names, where the family is not settled.
Such substantial names fluctuate between two families.
It then acquires two concoctions and, in some cases, they remain in an incompetent form.
For example, the words “lightener” or “chill ” are male and female, in that first one they tend to bow according to the pattern “a system” according to the formula of “piss. ”
For other groups of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, such as: ‘overall’, ‘kidluben/kidlubal’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (with food).
Both shapes are in writing, they have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as the "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is indisputable, so are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "codock" and "cobble" and "cobble" etc.
Some of the words that entered the Czech language were originally incompetent, but they gradually take over Czech ends.
A typical example is the expression “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “bullet”, which remained in the middle of an incompetent family, but has endings according to the model “garden”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turké border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get into Europe.
Thousands of people have begun to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankar stopped fighting them.
Europe's politicians promise to support Greece, humanitarian aid is also planned by the Czech government.
What is it that motivates refugees to travel the most uncertain way?
And what's the situation right there?
We haven't seen the sky for three months and we choked, describes the Sydney journalist.
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozens of people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have degraded millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves deal with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as critics say?
And what will the countries in the context of climate change have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False charges have always been, and they're very rare.
That's why everyone's always written about it all over the place.
It's hard for people to figure out how sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they're trying to arrange it.
I don't know anybody personally who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who were raped, and I've seen how they often treat people their surroundings or the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
Trend has become a victim finally opening up about their trauma.
But he still keeps too many people to himself.
Yes, they will also find those who falsely blame someone.
It's ugly and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a lot of the charge is thought to be" and that it's a "trend" that you only help sexual rapists.
The Czech Republic floods the built-in houses, families have no money to complete
The prices of construction material in recent weeks and months have increased by more than 30 percent.
That's why a lot of people got into a stable situation.
It does not have the means to complete the family home and the banks refuse to increase the mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish their family home.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation.
In a better case, people move into a built-in and uncircumcised home.
In the worse case, the built-in houses are uninhabitable, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and still pay rent," says the economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll be building two to three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of us have.
For us as a construction company, it's hard for us to keep up with some things contractually, even though the material healed.
So we're doing no profit," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Sivoň.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house to go out to five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," Slovňň added.
From the material the copper, iron, as well as installations and tonic equipment were most undermined by the material.
Building companies are also fighting the shortage of labour.
In the Czech Republic there is a lack of graduates of construction industries and the influx of foreign workers is holding the pandemic.
At this point, only the situation regarding the issue of a construction permit is more favourable.
“In October, the authorities issued 7 675 construction permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” explained Křeček.
We're good, and we'll be better.
Real vision is missing, says Czech commentator – his Radio
In addition to classical celebrations, the introductions of politics have traditionally been accompanied by the introduction of the new year.
In addition to Prime Minister and President ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman and Presidents of the Senate and the House of Chambers, spoke to the nation this year.
What have we learned about the fundamentals?
As in that, my diplomat feels super right now, I have my own subject, which I choose, I tie to a bachelor, I always work on it for a whole year, and then in a week to two, I write a written piece.
The states are completely calm with us if there's no real poppy man and something left in his head, so the commission won't choke him on the theory.
Maybe I learned a week at the station, and when I was at the ends, the committee always tried to pin me on some logical ride that was right for me, and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do them a semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're old enough.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test that shows knowledge gained within the project, not just defence.
All right, but don't put your e-mails and your phones on and send no packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick they are.
Those people in the embassy don't have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to Pú's teddy statue.
Maybe you could just give her a little more to put Xi Jinping on your ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta throws artists in sticks below their feet.
As soon as you don't give up your stories every day and at least every other day a new picture will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function it is more important if a lay, a comment or a saving.
It's been killing me lately, so maybe I'll have to cut to tictock where a lot of artists out of my business have been successful and they won't let it happen.
Finally, I would also like to see something user-friendly that doesn't expel artists with all creativity and energy.
Declaration by the Working Party on Donbase
The marriage – yes, the crash – no, express their opinion on the opposition to break down the USSR.
Thirty years from the illegal breakdown of the USSR.
On 8 December 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
In Belarus, December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, without any legal authority and breach of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open-minded attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed the agreement that ‘the union of the SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist’.
With one cut of the pen, the vast country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants was "broken".
Tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens have fallen into the USSR.
Since the early 1990 ’ s, Russia’s population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
We have lost more people than in two world wars, even regardless of the loss of the Roman population of the former Soviet Republics!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous 70 ’ s during one session in Belarus’s forest were betrayed by the socialist camp ( created by the price of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Land War).
They have, knowingly, deindustrialisation, removed agriculture from the world’s largest power of fourteen republics, which have previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, then we see the loss of the population, the destruction of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet area, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as a “vakum of power”.
Everything that was betrayed and published in a hurry was quickly completed and conquered by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world has been shaken today mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the fridge and make it Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, it's down to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday's chain - describe to me a mechanism that makes the meat a change in its price becomes a burden for my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday, and this meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I answer myself - nothing.
This crap about being cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, broken or bad, they're very retarded to tell you the truth.-)
Now, I've been going to Brno to the Head and the lady's under the door to hand over some pamphlet, and I always take things like that to help the British, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of celestial reasoning and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it was gonna be some kind of agitator.
After reading, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good machine, full of useless tricks, like I'm supposed to be washed up and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, that's why the rains don't have to pay.
I've seen something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional extortion force you to suit this man because you love him without even realizing how much it is in the [bleep] situation.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk.
Or maybe when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she was crying and she asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she began physically blocking the door.
Cca was a great relationship, but then another six months passed, and she started snooping on her finger.
Then I ended this relationship with the one I told her I was breaking up and lying to her, but I can talk to her about it next week to calm her down and not catch an amok again.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions and overall joy.
I'd rather keep my distance.
When insurance companies go out here by buying a test cloud and chasing positive, they wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we're getting is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in a random number generator dropped five days of domestic prison.
In the west, they've already stopped the shaky, and they've admitted that there's no point in dealing with a disease weaker than that famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is the new one, and he has to steal something else and drive ego by making up a fight.
I see an old-fashioned bastard is coming back.
After several years of dampening and suppressing this unfair business, the MLM recruiting again returns to the eviction.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, my freshman in the UK), initial promises of training products and business skills quickly crossed into "you don't need to care, especially get people".
To be honest, I was interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and cut people off.
When the first made-up money came in, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pick up some of the products a month.
The investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profit, or did a person feel like a pot dealer?
But what I can tell you, experience was valuable, one learned that it wasn't supposed to jump on every pin and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial people, but they certainly will not be praised by expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I didn't see much of this in the corporate.
HR's cool, managers are looking for their management, and they don't stick much in our noses.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form of what it is going on in our country (set some targets for the next year, we'll look at what came out and what's not) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company's actions are equally optional.
But even within our company, we're a little unique - there's a department that's more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're such a nearly-starter who's squatting in the office of a big corporate no.
But it doesn't bother us that much while the results are there.
A Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police were constantly looking for missing 32-year-old Czechs, who was missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the demise of Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that the woman from Uherskohradiska found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police this afternoon confirmed that she had found the body of missing Czech citizens in London.
The cause of death is investigated.
In view of the family, we will not communicate more information on the case.
My condolences, he said on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on November 28, on the bus on her way from work, and she was supposed to pick up cash from the ATM before the show.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Then after that, the London police began to search for her, Interpol set her up among the missing people around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police in this connection had already been arrested by one man a few days ago.
He had a role to play in the case and what he suspected of, but she didn't publish.
At the end of the year, in four municipalities, a new representative was assigned to each other.
On Saturday, 11 December, Kónya in the municipalities of Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Mosteck, Nová Ves na Libereck and Rovná in Pelhřimov were elected new representatives.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law of a specified number or the elected representative has broken down here.
99 valid candidates were selected for 28 mandates in the new elections.
The voting share reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the town of Rovná, where it voted 93.62% of the legitimate voters.
A total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest of 33 years.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for new elections to the representative offices in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men were among 28 representative posts.
The average age of running was 46.6 years old.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The development of the results of Saturday elections is symbolically closing in a rather demanding but successful year.
There were squares of new or repeated elections to municipal representatives and above all, the very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of us had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which gave greater demands for equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, First Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous infection here, at the very beginning, to deal with it, but it went without any major problems.
Deal with how idioticly a large proportion of the population is built on all its layers, and I have a problem with that.
I'm looking forward to vaccination because he finally makes me less dependent on other people not being stupid.
The President's office and competence would be ruined.
The chance that this is really happening is how the others call it very small.
Besides, I'm not sure that the disciplined file could be regarded as treason at all.
Zedrada is a act which threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
Must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic influenced an intimate life: Increase the number of people under 35 years who are without sex all year round
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mostly religious people, reports the DailyMail daily.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35 who break up with sexual life rose from 8 to 21 percent.
The woman between 18 and 35 years who said that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these can be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make young people less and less of a priority.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who have not had sex has increased rapidly,” said the researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
For people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they were free of sex in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
The lack of sexual activity also contributes to the fear of pre-marriage and religious establishment.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 is still falling.
Young people think about pre-marriage sex divides him up, about 30% of him's got a bad thing, while about 70% thinks he's okay.
“It is true that among the single individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior moves this trend,” Stone talks about these thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage are the reasons for the religious establishment.
Since 2008, single people under the age of 35 who participate in religious meetings have increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Between the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, in particular, social alcohol drinking during the pandemic period, contribute to a fall in sexual activity.
The study also showed that sex is less likely in people without work or less income.
Another reason can be the digital media expansion, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, making this need "reimprove".
This trend was mainly caught as a blockdown at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The entire management of covid vaccination is whether society should force part of the population to act that they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I am most interested in personally in the issue of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don't tell them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly not hear a disinformation in the death of an eight-year-old man who didn't know very well, and he couldn't get into it and finally get caught and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can give us a hoax and totalitious state for the death of an impoverished immunizer who is here next to the SPD and the KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners are probably part of the second group, and therefore they will indeed be able to do so themselves.
Czech without snow.
How does mild winter sign up for a dry fight?
Summer winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowpieces in the last time.
Ski resort operators will not be able to meet without technical snow, weather is also difficult to prepare the ski resort Jizera 50s.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight dry in the Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about a pancake.
One day in high school, a teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so we could take a ride on the boat by river.
On the way there, we went one of these quite wide streets, and who we probably don't see in the middle - the rise of the Hare Krisna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Lucky for me, I ran away, but with one friend, they got in the middle of it.
When she left them, we asked her what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not so much going on, but the system's falling apart.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, following his previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, arrived at Warsaw, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz pointed out that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, according to the Chancellor, is appropriate to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “normand group”, combining France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night-time we record hundreds of attempts by (illeg) crossing the border.
With Chancellor, he dealt with other sanctions to protect Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in Kremlin, finally understood that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to DPA, ensured that Warsaw enjoys German aid in a dispute with Belarus and condemned the non-human treatment of Lukashenko’s regime with runners.
A drunk Polish distillery caused an accident, tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene, but the car was driving another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that even so, she could lose her driving licence for not giving up driving privileges and catching her out of the accident, she went out with the truth, said TVN24 station.
She admitted that another nun had hit her in the vehicle and asked for her help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestin.
They faked her breathing test and after they found out that she had more than two promile in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she was going to testify in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovic but didn't watch his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot the basic thing about it: the legality of the film craft.
After the "F. Brabce Gump" movie, a dog who taught people to live, now the viewer's emotion in the cinema goes off with another shot here we watch.
The co-author of scenarios and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely builds on his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene comes the speaking prodigy of Hugo and some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the Šumava guesthouse, who smittens, and so they start to take care of him, Julia's father with her partner and her daughter Veronika.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's just a teenage girl who's having her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovicová (who is also the producer of the film) have been dealing with the process of telling the story in the previous text, but they have had at least children and dogs there.
This time she wrote a creative pair even weaker script, which causes a mixture of wonders and senses of embarrassingness.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, though the scientist, is subject to a desire for a child of darkness, and if a proper “constation” comes, he co-operates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever coordinates he is right now – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmír will shoot his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who will fall into the coma, and the family is taken by the hospital to play the miraculous process of healing the dog in the heart of Sumava.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the strength of animal sweethearts.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer wonders what a content pelmel full of unfaithful situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, dog-dozen competition, Sumavian charlatan, policemen coming to search for "roads" and discussing herbs about the fertiliser power of bone meal – and which, of course, a blotched family in the guesthouse will drink.
When a hero wakes up after a hard coma and looks back, he sits on an inflated and stuffed with a cigarette at a family table and requires his father's whiskey and quenchings as a veggie, you can't laugh.
On top of the viewer, the creators will explain that “this is sometimes after a coma”.
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of work with text, ability to build a carrier situation, feelings for characters and points and direction.
The acting performances are irresistible, cut helpless and overall impression made.
As Luke Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to settle down their party, they have not much to play.
The only way in which the film remains is by the poetic images of the Sumavian nature cameraman Vladimir Holomk and the pair of lakes.
It's not enough to draw a few characters, a turbulent cover and a dog's poems, let alone the more folk vulgarian terms that the characters are allowed to do.
The argument is neither a summer membership in the lake breeder club - as is the case with the producer lady.
With good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with the dog must also be the knowledge of craftsman if you want to tell a true story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There's a little too much erotic for a good family shot and a minimum feeling for a genre.
Not even as an ad for canistherapy would pass this amateur piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant surpluses just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcedness, here you can see how much you understand, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd been listening to these things all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in the case of a Brigadier's allowance.
The Middle East is suffering from an unusually dry month.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
“Also the lack of precipitation during November, as recorded at certain stations, is unusual,” confirmed Israel’s meteorological service.
For example, Kfar Giladi, Northern Israel, reports for November only six percent of the long-term precipitation average.
Two days of rain this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been here in a while.
It's also the right Christmas club, and the people of Navaret your Askar rejoiced.
The reductions in Israel come almost exclusively in winter months, they are impacting and irregular.
In winter rains are dependent on forests.
Without them, they're begging, and they're susceptible to fires.
It's not just forest, it's also a supply of drinking water and a thread for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilean lake, was filled this year in spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
The watermen warned before dry long ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may occur here," said the spokesperson of the Israeli Water Farm Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
There are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there is tank wagons.
Waters and private wells dry up.
“This year, I had an order of 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years,” reported the driver of the tanker vehicle Imád Sulejman in September.
In Iranian Isphahan, the clashes between farmers and security forces broke out.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The island of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its most narrow November in many years.
Israel is preparing military action against Iran
The Minister of Defense stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that Washington informed on the preparation of the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
The Gantz in the United States is trying to convince Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and the world’s powers “have understood that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I looked a little, and I grilled her in an interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these subs, so I've only been running out of doubts and questions for a while and finally thanking you and leaving.
You can tell me I'm a bastard, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waited them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic have experienced the first major challenge for skiers this weekend.
After a smooth snowfall at the end of the week, there is no need for snow, and some skireals started their operation.
The convention also did not relinquish the obligation to show itself at the lifts by the covid certificate.
While climbers don't complain about their concerns, some ski equipment rental companies report less demand for their services than before the epidemic.
To cross-country ski trails, thousands of people went to Liberec on the weekend.
Skiers wanted the weather offered today by the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went out of Friday’s evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” praised the director of Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jesenik on their first weekend skiing in the new season.
It was opened, for example, by Ski Arena Karlov or the Centre in Branné, Šumpersk.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today it was estimated by 400 people.
The terms are super.
Today, the sun was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praiseable representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Prochzka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a time limit after covid-19 disease has been processed.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and proved to be necessary documents, said ČTK René Hrošte from the ski resort Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded an incident unit," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by certain rental houses and ski equipment shops.
The interest in renting skis is fortunately.
It's not like in the past years, but it's still customers enough, said Alexander Bokiš from the Opava Skiopava store.
The greater the challenge awaits during ski courses.
Also, the director of Snowbear David Šinták, feels that he is not interested in renting ski equipment every time.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
In comparison to the period before the pandemic, we're about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
He and the pandemic people were lazy and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the big demand records the Novako rental on God’s gift.
The skiers started there a week ago, and now they have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow this weekend, but people have called forward, so we expect a great interest, just like last year,” said Pavel Novák’s operator.
The interest that is comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy not to go abroad, we must be able to live a good life abroad.
This does not include socialist health care, where dentists or specialists are often not available.
Smart and chic people who don't own property are leaving abroad.
The owner of the company doesn't just leave.
But with the rest, I completely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, the year ruled, and suddenly the annual emigration picked up by a few dozen thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot be in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is no choice at all.
If it's going to be bad here, it could also win some traditional V4 freak.
Young and educated will go away, his supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put into the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in the full current autumn, in Thailand, the crew of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor published a bloody picture of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury, or is it a trial for filming?
London police are still looking for missing Czechs.
Last time she was seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not even like her behavior and we begin to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor in the Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
“ Their family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Chesek said she left work on Sunday 28th November at 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
Last time she was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance reported one of her co-workers on December 3.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as a “a health nurse” at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas hospital.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear fellow Peter, who is missing,” said a group of medical devices in the twitter’s contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help find it to contact the police," continued the communication.
The public also calls on Mrs Harriet Harman, who, on Saturday, pointed out the case of Srncová at the press conference.
“She’s been missing for days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, worried about death,” said the Labourist Politicians, holding a picture of a woman distributed to the London police.
"I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
The police had already arrested one man in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC’s news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
They're not "serious quantities," but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that the threat of Invading us and starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quote upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted.
War is a hell of a fun and Russia has GDP Italy.
Comparison of the situation in 38 is off in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that with the first punk war and the "anexia" sília :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine has announced that it is not appropriate to comply with the agreement of Minsk, Russia is annihilated by those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's the "concentration" at the border that fits.
It's a set of servand...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, especially for urban connections
Travelers in Prague’s integrated transport (PID) will expect several changes from Sunday, especially related to urban connections.
There were new lines, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
The integrated system is newly connected by Mladoboslavsko.
In the capital since Sunday, there are quicks from České Budějovice in the station Garden City.
S7 trains will be launched on the route from Beroun to the Česká Brod by the Prague Central Station.
In the recently established station Prague- Záhradní Město will newly stop R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Light above Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starý Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladodoleslav will be included, including lines with a cross over to Liberec and Králové Region.
With integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 functioning will be regulated.
A new bus line of 405 will be released from Prague Zličína, which will go to Žatka.
There is also a new direct connection to Prague – Krakow near Raknik, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning tip and on weekend of the connection from Prague to Raknik, when the express line will be released again. 404.
Newly, the PIDs are included in the 400 and 410 lines driving to Liberec Region.
They're leaving Střížkov Metro Station, not the Holesovice Nádra station.
The home line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lipa to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes over Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonny in Podještědí.
On the contrary, it is cancelled or limited to a new operation on the tenth of the central Czech local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital under Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
The long-term restrictions on the line Prague – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue due to modernization of railways.
The changes are waiting for passengers also in other places.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section to line 420 from Dobřeše with a follow-up from Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevska.
The changes have been made to the routes of 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and the routes of certain buses at the border of the middle Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň region are modified.
Healthy snack/opportunity at the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidla.
Since I don't have any movement after work, I don't have the strength to practice, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm gonna buy a maximum pizza cream and a yoghurt snack and an apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend buying at the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If they are destroyed, the tree can be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're forbidding us to ride off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Gift's Reunion: I wasn't happy about this at all.
The Czech show business pond has been living nothing since Friday but the discovery of the Dara Rolls and Pavel Needzna's relationship.
They've been holding it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced for a singer.
A gift now sent a comprehensive message to fans, explaining why she kept her love for half a year.
"I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. a pardon, a Nedzna," jokes Dara Rolls, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it at all and jumps out on them and the canned ones, or us whose lives are in detail scattered.
As if one of you wanted to hear the opinion of whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your former partners and be familiar with the account of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a peacock, that's what you want, isn't it, Dera.
Two people together in Italy, where Rolls went to prepare her new fashion collection.
The unsub has been acting as Vice President of the Juventus Football Club for a long time.
The truth is, they've gone out until now because they've been waiting for Ned's divorce to be overturned.
The wife of Ian had been separated for three years, but they've only been in paper for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and like him in my presence, I stand by him. In good or bad, she closed the Roles.
Hey, the other commentors probably already said everything substantial, I'm just confirming that the colleges are super to the beginning, my classmates mostly got together during the first semester or two, and they got along and they found a submersible, which makes me feel like the best option, because you know who you live with.
The flats aren't usually far ahead, so I don't think you're gonna find much right now, but I'm sure it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, certainly avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (the streets such as Vranov, French etc., that is a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is a lot of student field, the Royal Pole, and that's the way it's good, and it's close to most of the VUT (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never been on rent before, but I'm the native of Brňka, so I can probably deal with Brne as if you've got any more information:)
But that's an example of completely normal thinking.
As a result of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly safe that the state does not finance certain schools sufficiently.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to take over a piece of education simply because he will throw a few crowns to a full state contribution and he will be able to teach at school what he wants.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in weight when a person who, two days earlier, expressed himself as a petition for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against if anyone's going to abortion is the same for you as the voice against some statue standing in the square?
I'd consult you directly with the guy who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already seen that (and it's a long-term professional) it's either going to throw something out of the eye, or they're gonna write something on xxx *** or... (by convention) and in the note that it's in readible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd be able to deal with it in some way, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and easier student, you can look in some sign databases and find the nearest.
But because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd think that the author or the printer simply created his own character, which fits to what's physically on the coin.
PS: Is it not, by any chance, the Odrican Empire rather than the OdryNach?
PSS: someone's already broken this place up for you.
Look at this comment with NUH
The politicians don't even know what the "the title" of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something because no one could understand any text is smiling.
All the important documents approved are examined by word, and some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for informal relations, for the establishment of superstandard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with this English after the GB exit from the EU.
I don't understand that haste on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 o'clock and never a problem.
That it's a ghetto that can only say someone who didn't walk in there in his life.
Yeah, most of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but all they do is get in the way of the pavement and park where they don't have:D certainly it's not that I'm afraid to climb up the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd just go in.
There are now newly renovated or newly built apartments.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dady and her mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's going to spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on advention lit the first candle, Felix Slováček not.
I don't have an advent prisoner, so there was nothing to light up.
I've seen the day before, and Lucie definitely has one too, and said a saxophonist, who's confirmed Patras's words to visit her often.
He visits, but he doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dad stayed alone after his departure.
He still doesn't know where he'll be at Christmas night.
We recently met with Annika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: SPOLu!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on a continuous basis, and I'm sure I'm going to buy something for Dad and Lucia, like perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the baptism of music video for Richman.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel like myself.
I will always find someone I like to talk to, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludka Sobota Adrian or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to take soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a total idiot not to land this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, you explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be put in hospitals in the crisis.
Cops are little and they can't afford it, just as many firemen and nowhere else there is not such a high percentage of trained people.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava is going to the head of previous governments, not the army, it's been asking for new toys long enough.
Record dryness in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought period in recent years.
According to scientists, water has been found in mountain and sub-terranean areas, a smaller amount of precipitation is also recorded in places where there is still no need for weight.
The cause of dryness in large parts of Central Europe is climate change.
But it also has a way of working with the land.
What are you preparing for in connection with the dryness?
And how can we help nature in hard times?
Yeah, it's gonna be that way. I can barely keep up in ice skates, I do know what to play hockey and that tactics (as I tried in Francise Hockey Manager) is also a total haluze.
And whether you're a hockey team of "maid of Russia" or "lama China" so lose two goals even though you don't have to win the match at any cost is different than when it's compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who choose what the referees don't notice whether male or female hockey is all weird, but that's about all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Consequence is everywhere.
And the opposite would be the case, and that the Czech Republic and Russia had already lost more often than it had won, it would probably have been the classic "vols lost" vs "we have won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
The hospitalized is 5766 people.
Total died in the Czech Republic 34 451 people, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic 1967 are 100 000, 871 to 100,000 for the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of dead people since the end of October.
Britain is facing a large wave of disease caused by Omikron, said on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical consultant for the British Health Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omitrin are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one died of omikron, but hospitalisation occurs about 14 days after the disease and about three weeks after the disease.
The chief of British Labourers Keir Starmer noted on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law in December, when the lockdown was introduced and was banned at Downing Street Christmas quiz.
One minister of Johnson's government argued that the flower took place "virtually" through the computer.
Of course, he was involved in a Downing Street group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
Last December, when a strict blockdown was introduced in London, and Christmas parties were banned, they organized Johnson's ministers despite the lockdown of numerous partyings.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were making fun of:
Paul Brand, an editor of commercial ITV television for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won a vast majority in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party says that it needs to be removed from the duties of the Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in spring, which can end the twelve-year reign of Viktor Orban.
It will be a choice of pan-European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote where they want.
This will allow Fidel to tie voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying fair isn't gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's going to be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he had a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will receive a unified opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orban and his side.
Won't they be trying to keep the power playing harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
She has recently escaped the independent media recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where she tells the chiefs of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time in 14, my mom's parents don't have too much patience, neither do I, my dad's long, but then she's gonna go extremely extreme (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry like a little horrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and I was all blue, that about two times took me under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they've gone out of my education, sometimes it's more likely they didn't know.
I'm definitely having a tendency to deal with things violence, like I was a little bit of a fight, and now I'm getting into something, and as a younger person, I'm like my parents, I'm so tired of getting too much over the handle, so I never get any extreme, but I always get the urge.
I'm not capable of determining how much it's my explosive, but I'm sure she's got a share of it.
I'm afraid I'll also lose my patience with my kids and deal with the same thing.
I think beating kids is just wrong, and that my parents didn't have to do it, especially at the time when it wasn't "emotional," but on the other hand, I don't think that every parent is just gonna fuck up, so I don't think it's possible to at least get a little bit out of it, so I don't read it.
I don't see why OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and unequivocal.
I would therefore call the Kundami those who form laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of losing your intake?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want a product and buy, and you're gonna have a mortgage to pay for?
Cat's monster world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with four defendants in the murder of Jana Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Havlíčko's proposal needs to rework substantially
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep storage of high radioactive waste is still not available.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal which was submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government following the years.
Its content, however, is in serious violation not only of the municipalities involved in the Platform against deep storage, but also of the Union of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-consumers from the law expect a stronger strengthening of their capabilities in deciding on the storage area which has been promised by the mayor since 2011, when the first work on this legislation has begun and which calls for both the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government will work in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
In particular, the proposed law of Minister Karl Havlíčka, which has the Platform, excludes municipalities: The demonstrated degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision to select a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the foreign or public can influence whether or not the process will continue at all in the area.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request prior to the initiation of a specific management of the consent of the municipalities concerned.
The proposed agenda almost completely forgets public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere constants in allowing procedures.
The design lacks system settings of compensation for the entire search process and selection of the site for storage, authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities in real terms, according to today's legal standards, do not have the opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a storage site.
Only in certain procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Authority or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to issue them.
Any action may not have an immediate effect on the conduct of research and construction works.
The self-recognition that Platform requests is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of government to prepare legislation by external law offices.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and binding on contracts with lawyer Jane Zemanek.
The total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million, according to the registry.
Antonín Seknička, place of mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesperson of Platform against deep storage said: After ministers of industry, who were able to settle the position of self-repair against state authorities in searching for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We offer a hand with a hand.
We also support the Union of cities and municipalities, which see the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities for such essential buildings as directly the municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote changes in state access to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that will not be limited to deep storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a locality for possible storage be conditional upon prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Hercules John Goodman (69) forced him to lose his fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although in his lifestyle, he had no need to change anything for many years, he was finally scared by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, informs The Sun.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premier of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke about his friends and his family begging him to lose weight because his big body caused his furniture to crack.

It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's about some text on a platform that expects people from the game environment, I wouldn't even translate it.
If it was a formal text or a college, I'd probably look for a boss to describe or explain.
There are more kinds of boss to everything.
Like a Dark Souls game, etc. has a few that yes, and so there's a "boss" sort of like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, the hidden boss) who are not at all needed to beat the game or the level to be finished, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games of the Half-Life type, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't move directly (Table, Gargantua), and you can call them something like that?
And then there are mini bosses.
In fact, it is probably not possible to translate the boss in a uniform way, and even other languages do not solve it (only Catalan, which bosses translates as a final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watchful completion of some level or task.

Peter Srnc's missing has been looking for British police since December 3rd.
Czech police were involved in the search.

The Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in the attack campaign, last month with the coming attack significantly increased last month.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attack strategy remains the same for now.
The infected Annex in an e-mail is intended to pay attention to the user’s name which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the bill repair for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login data which then sends the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the coming festivals and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November he remained active and spyware Forbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November, rather than on global issues.
Compared to October data, Formbook decreased slightly in November, but still worth almost five of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3rd, 10th and 15th November.
The form contained the most common attachment to the .exe file, which was named REQUEST FOR SECIFICATION.
But the name of the account is still on.
The Annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and attenuation of activities are recorded by security analysts in Fareit, which was worth 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic has not had any greater attack campaign in the past few months.

The Praho guide was bigger than the media report.
According to the images of the waterfront parade, and according to my experience, the protester is not afraid of estimated around 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the shores and bridges with opposite coastal communications.
That means there's a lot of people.
About four hundred demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade by an unwelcome number of passengers.
I say something new is born here, says Radek Wet.
That persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to a common speech.

It's hard to say what kind of movement this inconsistencies could be paid, it depends not only on money being transferred, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer won't become a square and more dosed.
It's definitely not a left-hand or mid-range movement, bet.
The three-injection vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multidose vaccine because it's obvious that we're going to have to let the revaccinating every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of scientists, without human rights, is proud.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the new government of Kirila Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue to change which won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in building up a broad coalition to take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been taking place since April when the last government has lost its election under the burden of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winners of the voting fight against bribery and power abuse failed to agree, so they followed a two-time election.

A global hit is from the "secretally" of the shot.
In Britain, there was a growing concern about the fate of 32 years of Czech Republic, which has been searching for the London police for several days now.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she drove from work home to the south British metropolis.
In addition to the police and its existing employer or Member representing part of London, she lived, following information on the work of the children's hospital.
"The disappearance of Petra is not even like her behavior and we begin to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor in the Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
“ Their family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Chesek said she left work on Sunday 28th November at 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
