In Prague, the ČSSD does not know Voldemort or the sugar shop.
The new City Councillor from ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier to communicate with their old colleagues from ODS at the Prague Council.
The daily News.cz members of the new ČSSD board "researched" as they know the notorically established slang, which was established on the town hall during the last years when Prague ruled the more current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague Political Smetal put in place during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Béma, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and bail in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councillor's familiar concepts don't understand much.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't really know."
"I am in Prague's politics more a novice," he responded to the test of "kmotrovsky" a councilman for culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And while it was a political veteran, he also reacted similarly to councillor Karel Brzeżyn.
Like the term "golf pit."
"It's the only expression you're giving me that I use sometimes."
"Jinak slang I don't generally recognize."
From the dictionary, whose terms of the journal News.cz published this June before the ODS elections, the editors selected six examples, mostly those which have notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Socialists should have explained the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf pit in Prague", "go to the sugar shop", "the bull's neck", "the wonder of the capital" and "reflect".
Three of the councillors agreed with the flower, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to be head of Prague School in the future - first he promised the interview, later he didn't answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Petr Dolínek even refused the test.
"I'm not talking about these things at all, and how the citizens of the Democrats enjoy it, I'm not going to evaluate."
"I am now trying to figure out how we're going to be in our software," he responded.
As has already been heard, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would in the title, allegedly not know that he is talking about a powerful businessman and friend of the exhibitor Bém Roman Janoušk.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucký and the only time he correctly estimated in the rehearsal is "the biggest golf pit in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says the Kauckie, and he adds, "But I know it more from the newspaper."
"I'm gonna have to pay for some language course," he's joking.
Golf hole then as a tunnel Blanka manages to decipher not only the Matador Karel Brezina, but also the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachym is also familiar where to find this character - the slightest meaning of the term "go to the confectionery".
"That means going to some Prague business," Plachý is close to decomposition that it's Janoušk's headquarters.
In harmony with March, he reminds us that knowledge was taken out of newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency test, there is no similar string of slang expressions running.
"I've been hanging out with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes they use shortcuts and complex names," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský, who is called Hulda.
"I've been called Bříza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues are calling me that," admits to my own nickname Karel Brzezina.
The diary News.cz name tried and works.
Councilman Weinert is for Děd's strikers or less of a friendly Grandpa, representative of Miroslav Poche, who pointed to himself before the election the fraud during the sponsoring of the party, has a nickname "Igráček" for some colleagues.
Reviewers are also the only thing that social Democrats in intra-art language allow.
Hulínský says Hulda doesn't like to hear it, but the diary currently.cz also recorded another nickname by the President of Prague.
"Doctor of Obscious Rights" says Petr Hulínský won his title at the bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the sorceress, released the brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
Rather, it belongs to the older generation, they cannot be involved in the work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one sent to isolation by the witches to avoid threatening the rest of the village.
"They can only make this fate very rarely."
"The young healthy women are not rescheduled because they help with work and birthing children," describes the order nurse who, in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso, is old in a special house by more than a hundred women who have produced their community from his own ranks.
The local government has now decided to act against an unusual "social measure".
She's released an information brochure to help limit the hunt to the witches.
But it's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he pointed out the disadvantage of written education of Die Standard daily.
Charity charges are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is neighboring Burke Faso, two hundred and fifty-year-old Ammy Hemmahová died last week after three women and two men tortured her, swallowed her with oil and burned.
The BBC server informed about the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, oil was lit up, which is used to ritual anointing.
They say that after the group wanted a woman to "wolve an evil spirit."
Insulating the "black people" is supported by people regardless of their level of education.
Der Standard's diary quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The human souls' food was always at risk," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, a witch chase is trying to moderate the government, in Gambia, he was still involved by the President himself last year.
"Gambian President jimmí, after his aunt's death, launched an extensive witch chase, which was supposed to have been involved in her death and tried to kill the president himself."
"He called upon shamans from close Guinea, who accompanied the police, soldiers, and personal security guards of the President violently seised men and women from the Gambian village to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
At the farm, trapped people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused gut and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's tenant: He's in the stoves, he's signed a higher rent.
Older substantiated man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Flats "uhlobarona" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arms he carried the file, and there was a new lease agreement to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who was in the execution of the punishment.
All three of them just deregulation picked up the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay 2+1 for the second category of CZK 4100 for the next year.
"And there is no hot water, and it has to be toasted (a stone for solid fuel, knowing red.)," says the man with a finger in his son's new covenant, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half rustically.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz, which has referred to new rental conditions as 'irregular and immoral', advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December when they publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man only has his hand over it.
"One says it, the other one," it's freezing.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory deregulation.
After the New Year, there is a large majority of apartments that are not yet renting in the Czech Republic.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Hawaiian waiting room RPG is one of the four in Ostrava, and on Tuesday at 9 a.m., it's already full.
There's a security detail right next to the door, and there's a starting machine at her.
"Nám 2011", light a special button on its touch screen.
One click, and it's gonna run a piece of paper with a number off the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already singing on a large screen beneath the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're next.
The rent comes for a while to ask the older married couple, the rush in the waiting room, but the new rents are clearly not affected.
Most people came to solve common problems as they did - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
The letters with new lease contracts are received in Ostrava by tenants of most of the total of 44 000 apartments portfolio RPG from about half of November.
RPG Flats suggest an increase of 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
A special predicament for new rents was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been going for over a week, so it's only in a rundown," the worker says, "after a while, he says, "when the client shows himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former Mining Flats are the local arousing theme.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament and Mr Lubomír Zaralek of the ČSSD took him quite seriously, and now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Not even the board on the toilet," the man is relieved in the introduction.
Most of all, according to the workers, pensioners are coming to see if they get a discount from rent if they sign up on time, as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount on February's rent will be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The Hawaiian "deregulation" show, but the questions are definitely not absorbed.
"From yesterday's 360 clients here for rent for 2011, there were only about 40 to 50 people," estimates the workers for the bulkhead.
RPG proposes individual bargaining where it will be needed on the web and its wall.
However, if both parties fail to agree, he will have to determine an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but only a possible and entirely legitimate legal process," warns RPG on its website.
"There no one will judge," he thinks of one of the workers RPG Flats and the man on the street outside the client center gives it in part to the truth.
"I have a 13 thousand pension and I have 5,000 food left, I have no reason to judge," he says.
Workbooks, though, are nothing but bad luck.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaladek texts them in the media so they don't sign, so I guess people are waiting," he's considering.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Flats, their economic necessity is increased.
"The existing rental still does not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, the director of the residential portfolio of RPG Flats, that the mere renter of the waste house fund is the main reason for the increase of renting.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion of rents into flats, in four years from 2011 to 2014, that is 5,2 billion.
So far, the large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the hatching waiting seats repeats several redly highlighted information.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be about CZK 7.50 per square meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be raised by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," warns RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not produce jumping habits, but will be spread out within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the flats, mainly to heat savings - new windows and warming.
Predominantly, they're supposed to be given to people who make a deal about raising rents.
The offices include the kindergarten, the architects understand
The administrative building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.design.
No one would expect to hide a mini school also with everything that belongs to it - colourful walls, creative furniture, a pile of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, she can be visited by children of the staff of Arch.design.
The design-architectonic company Arch.design, from whose studios there have been a number of major Brno buildings, has been counting with space for her company mini-school since the first drawings of the building Avriopoint.
She employs nearly 90 people mostly at the age of Babyboom, and she was concerned that women of designers and architects could get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibilities of reduced jobs, the school is a benefit which Arch.Design offers its employees within the social programme.
Stables and architects thus have the opportunity to undermine demanding jobs with care for the child.
The Minischools themselves invented the employees of Arch.Design, and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain the grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate minischool is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment and State Budget Operational Programme of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidies of CZK 2,8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment for two years and provide qualified staff and operations.
Once the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is required to operate a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project preparation lasted for one year and significantly assisted the Economy Rating company with applications for subsidies.
The care provides qualified staff, care for children all day long, nurse and teacher of the M.S.A., so children can go to school without age restrictions, yet most of them are older than 3 years old.
Because this is a "minimum", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more of them will take place during the day.
Schoolwork is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all staff have the same right to use school regardless of the firm's hierarchy.
Although this is individual education and care, the programme supplement in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, but also provide quality teaching - from basic recognition to training for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time, and stress situations fall apart with delay in raising their children from their parents' school.
Parents use working time more productively.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employer and an employee.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program enhanced staff marketing.
The house of bones is fascinating even after 100 years. Look into the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a right-wing lizard, the stairwell reminds the spine of the dinosaur and the balconies are open to fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona from the Catholic architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, he used his organic shapes to make a nickname for the House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of ducks and mosaics, façade resembling scales and all-individual soft curves, all these are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secesi.
The front of the house plays a dream line, tender colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
In detailed observation, you can see the geometry, rhythm and precise order.
In the night, the entire façade of home sounds even more dramatic, it is lit so that the impression of the shine of color is even more powerful.
The vigilance and twisting of shapes with the same measure appears in interiors.
The tree in the waves copy window frames, rails, decorative elements of the door, puppets and rails.
The Batlló house, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on building up an old building and building completely new, but soon Gaudí's idea for unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's business house but Antoni Gaudí did not propose himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
At his designer board, decorations for the owner of the property and the use of the mosaic in the facade were created.
Many other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together at the top of Casa Batlló's house began successfully working with Juniola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Güell Park, where there are other Gaudí's works.
From the locals, the house of destruction after completion served with its organic shapes the nickname "The House of Bones".
Others began calling it "the present house" for a specific opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, is similar at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motives contain other sculpture elements.
Gaudí has designed a unique central heating system for his time with air vents and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may appear to be their 40-degree pendulum.
In the work of Gaudí, he did not respect the building regulations of those days and was not bound to them.
At the beginning of the building, although he obtained a building permit from the city, the above information about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city council was degraded and asked for corrections.
By counsel, for example, the construction affected the pillars and the public pavement.
On the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the town section Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor was a social salon and on the third floor bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground was rented by a jewelry.
The entire six-story house, cut through the stairs, which can be built on the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all the right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of linking space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living room doors and the larger society can communicate conveniently without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate interviews.
In addition to the new facade, Gaudi's house was also acquired by an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, surrounded by an inner yard, and lights.
The game of two colours adds maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to bet on the principle that white reflect light more than dark rays, which in contrast absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone in 2005.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and cost-effective apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the hundred and fifty anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued at the tour because they found that it was a very advantageous business and, moreover, the tours extended by common and sole spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is certainly not negligible, amounting to EUR 16,50 and students, pensioners, groups and tourist cards holders have a 20 percent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price entered to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly make friends with some of the villagers and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grates: Women have requirements other than men
Not the bed frame, but the quality of the lighting area, i.e. mattresses and grates, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, they must be complementary harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When choosing, he decides a lot of things from weight, height, age, health and gender owners.
Also important is the type of interior into which mattresses and grates are taken.
A typical example?
For weekend cottages, where they don't sink regularly, they're not suitable latex mattresses, because they're slower "heating".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of air channels in the core, and still lying on a solid board, they hold humidity: a mold could appear below them.
When choosing, it also decides the habit.
Who has spent longer periods abroad, where very high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, it will be hard to feel good about low and hard surface.
"For all the hockey players who came back from the NHL, they complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their yellowed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"This is also recommended for people with diabetes, who have a nervous system disorder, so they misinterpret information" from joints and skins," explains Sylva Hadamchik, who specializes in the encrusted furniture.
Many of them, but also other customers were looking for a mattress years ago with lazy foam.
"It's all right now, the right mattress has the Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL boy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "sight" works easily.
Optimizes its weight and shape according to absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
You're not being pushed, you're not going to turn around at night after a tough fight.
Just get some better sleep.
Roasted foam also works as protection against fertilisers.
When selecting the size of the mattress, add an additional length of feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 180 cm in a double bed.
For single beds, for example in singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Jinak is a simple rule for the width of beds: when lying on your back, you should have your hands slightly covered in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, features of Cechu challoons and decoratores, who has been working on a healthy sleeping and ergonomic furniture for many years and has been teaching it at professional schools.
At the double bed, he needs each of his own grates and mattresses, but here he is paying attention to the purchase to sweeten the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing other than putting the grates into different heights, but it does not have to be done for you with each frame of bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring bone of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the shapeing and perforating layer.
"When you touch your hand or get to the mattress, you must not feel the spring," warns Helena Prokop.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Whole-bed beds, when mattresses and bases are like grown-up Siamese twins, have nothing to do in bedrooms.
The mattresses are bad for wind, they can't be washed away, which is already normal.
And since in the night we usually reach 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to remember one large (and crammed) seed.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans with a lifetime of up to 25 years or even life guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the Board of Practices from Sellers: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and the work of sensory coating, do not give up, but rather add a mattress guard that you can easily remove and drain.
Even though today's coatings are commonly produced, we'll get two parts (for washing and washing the washing machine size very important!), however, it could be handling in larger types (and in one person) to remember the match of light weight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid plate in your bed instead of grate?
Never!
Maximum bed intended for visits to one night.
However, keep the board provided (if it does not already have it) by ventilation holes and use the mattress with a spring bone and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs (from it. Taschenfendernern) and a rubber layer.
Polyuretane mattresses don't belong on such bases.
On non-bleaching lamela grates with 14 to 18 lameles will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (a kind of combination of latex and coconut), but you will always get paid the grates with a larger number of lamel, 28 and more, where lameles are doubled in the area of the crater and can be regulated by the need.
The positioning lamel grates do not include mattresses with spring bone, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting tights, the so-called shoulder collar can be added.
It's a special lamel grip that allows you to press or even bend the lamelus so that your shoulder is "scraping" well.
For men who have "arms over their whole back," it's definitely important.
They even remember her, even producers of mattresses, who began using a softening zone in the area of the arms.
Women also remember - the ones who give softer surfaces in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers are determined wings or wafers with so-called multitorial spraying.
The pressure is broken down into more points and the voltage is reduced.
But beware, as soon as you use the right mattress and grate the wrong pillow (big and "duated"), most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to deny the head and the tip only interfere with the shoulders in order to release the shoulder muscles.
As a suitable size it is recommended that 50 x 60 cm are preferred, for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance (with the shoulder column of the gutter or a soft zone in the mattress) the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original slides filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least suburbs.
Trend's just a bi mattress too.
Oils from which polyurethane foam is produced are substituted with natural oils, such as coca and soya.
Perhaps all known manufacturers are using the soy just now.
"Bio u mattresse means that the core is made of material purely natural origin," explains Peter yourstíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There's a distribution for men and women.
While a man "cools" plant extract from the birch, to absorb heat and cool the body, women on the other hand with "tops".
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it's weaker sex heat.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (has more pores with broken cell structure, is more later than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining various weights of cold foam and "land" foams, there are multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bed and heel are supposed to be.
You will pay for the quality of the mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet the health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as health aids.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first to benefit from this.
Save for mattresses and grates is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use the action of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam Memora in the cover for 11 990 crowns.
The second one can be arranged for free.
Éru lazy or viskoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started the "cosmic" temp material Tempur.
Originally, he developed as a material for NASA because astronauts were exposed to enormous overload at the start.
The temperature is smooth, the cold is on the other hand.
The heat of the human body will adapt perfectly and distribute the pressure thereof optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of dusts, but also to increase comfort while sleeping.
Viscolastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for special pillows under their feet, which lighten the leg and vein system.
The domestic producers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People's surveillance equipment wants more and more parents, so they want to black out their kids.
Fear for his own child brings more and more people to the idea of guarding through GPS.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Annika Janatková.
So far, the device is about as big as a silhouette box, soon but it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people have spooked the case of the missing Anika and began to quench in the middle of how to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of disturbing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spy, but a further means to reduce the likelihood of becoming a tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers tracking the device on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some case there may be abuse of such devices, for example, if they fit in someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met a case like this."
"Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the box serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Dan Bočková's child psychoscientist warns that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very little children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations were caused earlier in parents' mobiles, but they could be turned off as well as these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to her, it is also disputed whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is being prepared, the perpetrator will practically always be able to ensure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"When tracking devices begin to expand, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices may assist in the event of an unexpected attack with pedophile.
According to Robert Čech, from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services both for cars and for persons, even after attacking an immediate destruction of the surveillance device, its presence can help.
"The establishment can be set up to send the location regularly after a certain period of time."
"If damage occurred, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The other devices have built-in pressure meters, so even if you had slipped and remained still lying, the device will immediately send a warning with the positioning position," says the Czechs.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can record special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to those of the size of a box of sires or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so at risk of losing them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore now testing devices that look like a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in knowing the possible aggression of the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll know them after a while, and he can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking equipment is developed into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology used to guard cars.
It is a combination of GPS location detection (which uses common autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has a string of fires that would overwhelm the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years
The Czech Army bought 445 kilometers of cords that set off explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence has added a line of 224 miles [24 km] in storage.
That's how the military's got the supplies for 225 years.
The problem is, the durability of the cord is two, four years at most.
The army bought a burnt cord from STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
General staff on the basis of the purchase of such a large amount of MF DNES heat cord replied that soldiers use 60 kilometres of sunburns per year during training.
However, it follows from the calculations of the army's pyramids, which the IMF DNES raised, that it would then be a very intense pyrotechnical training that all generals, officers of command of the army, secretaries or cleaning staff would have to undergo annually.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondru and Commander of the army Vlastimila Picka do not care.
It would only be possible to justify the annual consumption of the army 60 kilometers of matches.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be enough to train every new professional at the very least two metres of burnt cords, as experts say, so the army provided with fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of female or special units - supplies for these 225 years.
The soldiers of fast deployment recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no bullets in their handarms, so that they were too busy with the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't take my head to buy so many matches from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they'll be up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, who as traders we try to meet," says business manager STV Group Jan Děcky.
The spokesperson of the Defence Ministry Jan Pejšek justify hundreds of kilometres of lines purchased, even by the military having supplies of this "munk" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcky of STV Group only talks about four years' lifetime of sunburns and police or military pyrotechnics even for two years.
"When perfect storage can be those four," says one of them who, as a soldier, does not want to publish his name as a military critic.
After the lifetime of each ammo must be carefully tested whether it is yet reliable and does not threaten the soldiers to live.
However, these tests are not free and costs more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 kilometres of burnt cord.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and four miles," interpreter Pejšek spokesman of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the firing line of police pilots who destroy ammo from World War II or here after the Soviet army has not been more than 1,500 metres.
And the police always order just enough to use this ammo before they end their lifetime.
It has proved it because of the safety of the pyramids, and can also be more flexible to get more modern and therefore more reliable types of cord.
Today, the Ministry of Defence has had considerable problems with the destruction of tens of thousands of ammo from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when a two hundred thousand Czechoslovakian army prepared for the campaign on Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyramids MF DNES addressed, awaits the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometres of old matches that "lacino" is buying today.
I'm drawing from the contacts I've gained from the competition today.
The winning place in the Živostník competition of the year helped Lukas Pytloun to sell the franshize of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec became the winner of last year's Živostník competition.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And in a foreign language, he realized that there was no quality accommodation in Liberec at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and bank loan, he bought a half-cold house with five flats.
The fact that he was still a junior high school student at that time was a lot of courage.
"The relationship between quality and accommodation price with us did not give me anything to try to do about it," says Luke Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began renting to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually converted to the guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, he gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec in seven years of business, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year he was added to it by another quality.
"We have a signed hotel contract in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our French concept and other interested parties to the French hotel Pytloun reporting," says trade mark number one last year.
"And at this sale of licenses to operate the hotel with great measure involved the victory in the competition of the Živostník of the year," Pytloun said.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and the surroundings.
"The people used to recognize me on the streets, often congratulations on the streets, and I must say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition strongly recommends to all who are trying to do something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says he's drawn from contacts and knowledge to which he might not have been able to otherwise.
"With some I met with because of the competition, I started to deal regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, fell a little bit for every employee.
And that he's got about 70.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in their participation in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is cast forward," says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
My successors wish for a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Euforia quickly cut down the impact of the crisis from the victory.
However, thanks to the ambition of the winner, the Farmet has worse times.
For the first place in the previous year's Vodafone Company of the year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, arrived in Slovakia last year.
The jury then appreciated the efforts through which he built from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalice company with a hundred million turnover.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my coworkers and increased our confidence in the fight against competition," said last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, it was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Charles Žďárské's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for communists seized property, he didn't hesitate for a long time, refused his career in the company where he worked, and with a couple of friends around his dad started a company for plastic baths.
Soon later, they began to specialize in leaves of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
A greater awareness between the unrealistic public was achieved by the company after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers started to notice the Farmet brand significantly better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they cooperate with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, last year, in Farmet, it was not only in the sign of euphoria of victory.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic performance by 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for selling machinery goods.
She has raised a crisis that has not yet been touched by citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to limit the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, has not avoided us."
"The trades fell by 40 percent, we had to cut our production and it was released," explains Karel Žďárský.
A life - inspiring company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But the situation was done and the company was kept profitable, even less than before the crisis.
However, what was not reflected in the Farmet, investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built a research and training centre, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, obtained the main awards in home exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them as well as the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A budget that removes nonsense regulations
The survey on Absurdit of the year is a fourth part of the business encampment.
Some senseless regulations have already been deleted.
The illustrious winner of the next year's Absurdite survey has become a duty to carry documents that are also available online to officials.
She decided more than a third of the less than four thousand votes.
For example, social security management required a paper extract from the trade register, although an official can get it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it'll change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the Commercial Register on checks for insurance payers," said Czech spokesperson Jan Buranová.
To shine on all the regulations and regulations that companies and businessmen in the Czech Republic must fulfill, and these senseless cancels are the purpose of the Absurdita year competition.
This year, the fourth part of the business convening organized by the Hospodářské noviny and is looking forward to the ever greater popularity between the public.
If there were about three thousand votes in the vote last year, there were no more than four thousand of them this year.
And there's no wonder, all kinds of legal obligations that serve just to keep business are still enough and enough.
"We are in front of the world's leading places," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Trademen of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become a cursed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, in comparison to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed its 74th position in terms of business conditions, and it is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdite of the year was first announced in 2006 and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Administration of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense may be accepted every year from April to the end of September when the conclusion of the competition is made.
The web address www.firmorok is used for login.cz Then the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for "anticen" and allow the public to vote over the Internet during October via www.firmorok.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdita, who gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey has been applied more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and a regulation that removes meaning.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement among the nominal ones to pay tolls for the maintenance of motorways and speed roads, or for businessmen with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
This year's list of seven proposals is published on the page of the competition.
The publication of the competition, which takes place at Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November, is part of the hapenning which regularly participates in political and social figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Economic Chamber of Economics.
"The economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws its sticks under its feet, so it is my goal to cancel at least three dozens of paragraphs each year which are simply complicated by business today," said the Minister of Industry and Trade, Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break a nonsense order doesn't go out empty.
In 2007, the company’s obligation to report to the Trade Office three days ahead of the exhibition stand, or the pilgrimage was placed on the premises of a permanent establishment.
This obligation has been removed by a new trade law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was announced by the Labour Office for its foreign employee's service journey in the range of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And a third of everything's good.
By 2009 Absurdite became a regulation for physiotherapy to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two scales.
This was a decree of the Ministry of Health this year: the obligation to have a refrigerator fell off.
The new category appreciates the company's socially responsible
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The new year in the fifth year of the Competition of Economic News is the category called The Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We would like to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, a regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is the publisher and guarantee of the competition as well as in the case of the rebellion of the year.
In the first year of this special sub-category of the 2010 Vodafone Company, companies for which success in business was not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would make a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities is different from the other diametrically, support and consideration can be considered as the common denominator of their efforts.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and others, such as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
14 full-public finalists, for example, found the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
In another example, Isolit-Brava, a company that has been responsible for the Pardubé Region for 17 years, has been the main contributor to the Foundation's Fund of Presiding the Hendicipated Children.
The old paper company from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of them, has become the responsibility of the Central Bohemia Region and the Vodafone Company of the Year’s Vodafone Company as the third.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft won a flexible working period, which was even reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The title of the jury also granted her the priority of buying from Czech producers, promoting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little environmental impact as possible," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The IT company Enlogit from the Ústej Region is responsible for the health of its employees, and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards to each notebook, support their work from home and use catering services provided by the local safety workshop at their corporate events.
"We support the foundation of the Man in distress, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activities of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contribute to their staff in the form of superstandard bonuses.
"With us again we give contributions to food, transport, increase qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the UK construction company Times, winner in Moravskoslezský kraj.
All regional finalists of Vodafone Company of the year were automatically applied to the category of the Responsible Company, who answered the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete replies to the questionnaire were then withdrawn from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies failed to answer the questions, the responsible company of the year could not participate, but are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year."
"The self-certificate only in this competition is not possible as this is a subcategory of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen police arrested in a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, last days, anti-corruption police arrested.
Detectives ironed the local entrepreneurs in the media sector and the businessman with Luboshi G's real estates.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition is given to specific interested parties.
Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for that.
"I can only confirm that the police are facing one person for the crossover of the public order and during the public competition," said the Head of the plenipotentiary of Antonia Green, with further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
Six-four-year-old policemen released their freedom after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum official information, the way in which the public competition could have been affected can only be speculated.
The spokesperson of Lubomír's Land Fund, Montenegro, on the question of Law, said that in a separate workplace in Pilsen the police actually arrested, during the public competition.
"It was about the client, not our employee," she explained.
According to Black, the right name "The call for a claim to transfer land according to the Land Act" shall be held where more legitimate applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the call offer a higher value for their restitution rights to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of the acquirers and the Land Fund shall then be transferred to the person who offered the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G., apparently, had information on who applied for the call, and since he himself is also a legitimate person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered interested people about the land that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he was insulated for that.
That would explain that he had so much money in holding.
Luboš G. had extraordinary PF contacts in Pilsen in the past.
He was working in the bail of former chief PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing the property in the replacement restitution, for which a decision was already issued on the location of the building.
This is when Luboš G. was acquired from the fund, for example by land intended for public communications, namely in a place where the entrance magistrate was to be built in the Borská pole industrial zone.
Later, he was very conveniently changed to a magistratate behind a house in the historical center of the city itself, which had a much higher value.
That's when the town hall had to come to it, because by blocking the land, the building would have been compromised.
The housing allowance will pay hundreds a month
The domesticities will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and table, heat supply, and there will also be a growing number of rents.
So families will have to pull out of their wallet from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity is up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and you will have to pay by 10 in some cities for the supply of water, and many times will also double the supply of central heat.
Power recovery should be made out to households in flats every year by a hundred yards more than now.
The electricity prices have all been reduced by the main suppliers and therefore there is a significant increase in the support of renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
The gas will heal slightly, but at a time when people are most toasted and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also count on hundreds of extra crowns each year.
While electricity and gas heals all over the country, the central heating price change differs from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by a larger municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns a month from January for central heating, more than 1000 crowns per year will pay for families in Liberec.
The citizens of Prague are in danger that more than 9 percent of them will recover from water and table, if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it'll pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the general public comparison between the lower.
In the north of Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest prices, it has a watery and a table approach of 7.4 percent.
For example, they can increase the rental price in 450 000 apartments, where regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Flats, which owns around 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who will not agree with the new rent will give company a trial.
The regulated habits that people pay in about 300 000 apartments could grow by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk by fernet and rum. Beer is fashionable, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better brand whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which they end up most often in the care of drunk doctors, who have not been in the care of 15 years.
An exception are not children who treat monkeys repeatedly in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of physicians who face similar cases in the children’s wards.
"Some beers or wine are completely unforgivable because it takes you long to drink them."
"Trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Prime Minister of Children's Department of Hospital of Hořovice in Central Bohemia Ludek Pelikán.
"If they can pull the bottle out of their father's closet, it's about whisky, otherwise it's over the fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of pouring it into juice and not feeling so much of it," explained the primary.
And for the truth, the spokesman of the Faculty Hospital of Motola Eva Jurin also gives him.
"It's usually a fernet or rum."
"That is today's modern alcohol especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was the olives they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to Mayor Pelekana, 13 or 14-year-old drunks are quite common in hospital income.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has worked ten years for paediatrics in Motole, where ambulances can be entangled by schoolmen from a wide area.
"One girl was lying in our house about four times."
"The guitar began in twelve years when they brought her to us with 3.5 milligrams of alcohol in addition in combination with exile," the physician described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in Holesovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is, her mother didn't find it odd that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," said the primary.
They just don't care about their parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring is considered the main cause of growing child drunkness.
However, addiction in the right sense is not spoken according to experts in children.
"The concept of alcoholic means a multiannual chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomenons that belong to it, and that's not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather significant failure to lead the family-social background," explained Mayor Pelican.
According to spokesperson Jurin this year, the paediatric clinic in Motole was hospitalized by mid-November by approximately 40 drunk children.
However, only those with severe intoxication that had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children's drunks, who take their parents away after an outpatient treatment, or maybe bring them home to the police, don't count.
Except in cases where children sit down after school and drink a bottle of chickens, there are three seasonal fluctuations, on which you can count: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"It's either a drink of grief from bad testimony or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"I've seen seven child drunks at once all in the witch's house," said Pelican.
The monkey who spends the night under the supervision of the physicians is a paradox in favour of the one who spends the next day at home with an unpleasant hangover.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will cause an infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing.
"They're actually better at it because they've got a good night's experience and a good wake, and they don't hurt them."
"Only they are confused about where they are" admitted Pelican, saying that sometimes they destroy patients with a pleasant mood at least by calculating the costs they have required.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on the acute bed will also go to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it all the time as a training tool when I was directly to those children, then, in a vision, calculated how much their drunkness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer at the brigada to earn for that one party," Pelicán added.
However, health insurance companies consider that there is no regressory management in which after parents would be able to pay for treatment, in the case of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in the hands of a stranger in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 of the total five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, on Tuesday they flew to the Spanish Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS resides.
It is the first time that machines of this type appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In the foreign so far, they were only at exercises or demonstrations.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1 which has still been run by the Czech army and which have been airtight.
The remaining three machines are uniform L-159.
The company Omnipol has already taken over them last week.
When aircraft are physically released from the Water East, Jan Pejsek is not yet known from the Press Defense Department.
"The L-159 unit aircraft for exchange were excluded from long-term saved aeroplanes, without other deposits and investments by the Ministry's Ministry of Ministry resort."
"The two local L-159T1 has been changed in the current state and form," said Pejšek Law.
He added that the army would not remain without two-point aircraft, because the Ministry of State signed a contract with Aer Vododdy worth CZK 200 million for the reconstruction of four unnecessary machines L-159 for two-digit machines.
One new aircraft took over by the army in July, the other takes over by the end of this year.
According to Peyšek, EADS has committed to plant aircraft in the arms of some alliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of L-159 aeroplanes is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO."
"There is therefore a matter of how the customer will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
They said that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns approved the Government of Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not write into the purchase of the tender and spoke directly to the EADS.
In the past, the defence management argued that the exchange will support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have a court order.
The European Commission has called for the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it had aircraft to choose on the basis of a pan-European Tendrum and not by speaking one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last to Kbela airport in Prague should arrive within 14 days.
Longer pointer than a ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have shown signs longer than their rings are exposed to a minor risk of diseased prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published by the British cancer magazine on Wednesday.
It may be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years of age," said Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The first may thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as the family health burden, added Eeles.
In 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and more than 3,000 healthy men were monitored with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had a pointer on their right hand shorter than a ring.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, in the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent for men to 60 was a decline of even 87 percent.
The length of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer pointer.
Recent research has shown that testosterone is currently supporting growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for the Czech Republic said that he is familiar with this study, but he does not seem to know that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most Europeans, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and pedestrians lies mostly driven snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The morning D5 motorway is closed between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and is also worth D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
News said it to the dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK).
At 91 kilometers, he crashed the truck, two trucks crashed at 93 kilometers, the accident demanded injury.
Several passenger cars have also ended in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
There were two stones hit down there.
Drivers should ride just behind Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and drive then at 182 km in Kývalka.
It's made up of multiple-inch collages.
There's also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there are a multicentimeter layer of snow, thermometers showing minus seven degrees of Celsia.
The wheels of cars are created, for example, in Proseku, and the Štěrboholská is also crammed.
The most sure means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje rides late on the line, for example, between Karl Square and Míru Square.
He's supposed to be sitting back in the Prague crisis room at 8:00 in the morning.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech railways had to cancel seven speed connections due to snow.
The problem is, for example, a line from Prague to Kralub or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 hours at night to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already down, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brno there are places forming snow languages and in Blanensk they are necessary to master some communication in the above places of snow chains.
Vyškovsko belonged to the most affected places.
There are closed roads so far: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to put fresis in their stretching.
When they are removed, it is not yet possible to estimate.
Caution in the area of the White Carpathians is required in Hodonin.
On the road, which are kept by an inert positivity only, lies a five-inch layer of snow, said the ČTK.
In the Czech Republic it was two to ten inches snow, the most rained in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In Moravskoslezský region, there were about 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually dropping.
American soldiers have a new "finding weapon"
The U.S. Army has set up a new "chhytro" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and the "change of the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is kind of like a super-expertious little gun.
It's designed by laser with accuracy for several meters.
Special bullets of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only at impact to the target, but at any point in their ballistic pathways.
So it can be used against an enemy hiding behind some obstacle, behind a wall or a cove.
Shora is usually not protected, and when the murderous rain of steel roofs comes down on him, it can eliminate it from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, which was involved in the development of XM-25, a new rifle of the first gun for the footpath, which uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier in principle treats her by finding a target, sends a laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of intention, according to him will adjust the direction and press the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"If you pull the trigger, the gun will hit and launch a missile at a distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu concert will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their post in July next year from the existing administrative building to Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field, specializing in computers and their maintenance, he will move in July 400 men and women his work place from the present administration building on Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in part Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesperson of Fujit, there should be another 100 jobs in the group, which are so far divided in the region, be moved there in a timely manner.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park seem to be more suited to the working way of the staff.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
Competitive partner Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global society such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments of the losers yesterday.
Head of the economic referendum in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was how he managed to get the "global player".
It says "fantastic demonstration of confidence in this locality".
Fujitsu is supposed to fit the city, and the seat is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi, regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reported to have been informed in good time by the management of the company about its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
Friendships, however, could not change the problem of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property on Marienbader-town.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it is to avoid long non-inclusion in such a prominent place.
"I hope he owns the building and hires a co-operative building."
The house on Rathaus-town, which had been used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" belonged ten years ago with other buildings on Marienbader-town to the most dedicated construction projects in the spa town.
Between the railway station and the town council was established as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticised, however, due to the massive construction of the areas which had previously served as a parking lot and also due to the height of the buildings.
In 2001 the company entered the house of investment consulting and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens.
The buildings that Fujitsu used were acquired in 2006 together by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA were sold in Madrid.
Fujitsu-koncern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers computer and server services for example, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in Rýna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, most of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Nederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary in this location will be Fujitsu Services and TDS.
In Astro Park's administrative building, 7 000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - his name warns of the star floor, which is 20 years old, is located in addition to other central unions of electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon switch off the server - threats against Assang
Wikileaks get narrow.
Amazon Internet service turned off a platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this has become a political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depressions.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a discovery platform, is getting more and more pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, a prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott the Willeaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led on the list sought by Interpol, is to be held by one news contribution in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the free country", the activists communicated the publication of short news service Twitter at the center (local time).
A short time earlier, Amazon's Internet company downloaded Wikilakes documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish secret diplomatic depesia Amazon Web Service (AWS) so they can handle a high number of approaches to documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this step: "Fajn - our dollars are now spending our jobs in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, they should stop selling books.
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after former Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers made a search, published a television station CNN based on information from Lieberman's office.
The President of the Senate Committee for Defence, threatened by Amazon boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would take this step earlier, given the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wkileaks act illegally, inconspicuously and carelessly, and our national security is at risk and this threatens life on the planet," was in one statement by an impartial senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of the Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on the report in the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australan in the UK is held, Scotland Yard also knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has always marked an investigation in Sweden as an intrigue to its opponents.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks Kristin Hrfnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were challenges for the murder of Julian Assang."
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, said Hrfnsson.
That's why the Founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hryfnsson seems to have responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that a responsible person be charged and executed for publishing at Wikileaks.
In Canada, he said on television one adviser to the Head of Government Stephen Harper, probably ironic, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use "the target plane".
In the meantime, the word shootout began between the White House and Assange.
US spokesperson Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "smere and absurd" that Assange asked the Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton to resign if he is responsible for recently published spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the views of one person with the website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government now has extensive research into the safety of its databases.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-terrorist Measures, Russell Travers, has given the White House a special mandate.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "needed reforms in the structure" which are necessary after publication of reports from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger due to the publication of Wikileaks.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the State Department of Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them, unless it's necessary."
Frozen University
The Gelato University of Bologna is preparing ice creamy sugar makers for a better season of the year.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from?
From Gelaterie and Gelataio.
Gelateriere, Czech a bit obsolete ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelatio takes out the ice cream from the cooling box, wipes her into her dues and sells.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to learn more about ice cream does not avoid the "Gelato-University" Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003 he established an ice cream machine manufacturer of the University of Ice Cream to fit ice cream everywhere with high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there is also a few days special courses for chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone yearns in her Midlife-Crisis after a new career, others are leaning on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all the worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of the Slow-Food and would like to offer a high-quality European product in Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman in Julia's household arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silk silkness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during her training in the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it belongs to this.
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts basic milk ingredients, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender that warms everything with an electronic program of 85 degrees and then cools to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine with cock and leaks pastrated white basic cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately the donor is covered by questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can a person experiment himself?
Luciano warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the time to the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only natural ingredients", apparently used stabilisers as well - mostly a natural product such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it will crash and the customer eats the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic matter are vacations.
It's gonna be more complicated with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with a taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The deliverers will try to force you to get a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"You should be experimenting simply."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from white basic matter that changes eggs to yellow cream and cocoa to the ground for all chocolate temptations.
Now she's taking a course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and pancake ice creams - either with or without eggs in basic matter, with more or less vanilla flavours or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruity ice creams.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyré - given the taste it is not always better.
Lisa's ice cream doesn't have to taste more nuts when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will produce a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the balanced mixture picks up the correct taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely number of tasks: If peach pure is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
You need extra sugar for lemon ice cream.
Luciano removes a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (which measures grape must).
Happily, the plates make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the machine to produce basic materials automatically.
There is also a device that makes the ice cream mixture simultaneously fit into the cream and cools the temperature to a minus.
Despite all the automation, we won't avoid small accidents.
Brazil Gustavo will soil himself and also his colleagues from above to down fruity dust when he gets out of control a huge blender.
"In every course" believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Double-light visitors
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This charge has now given rise to a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute to assess the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well", said in the middle of Munich, the head of the Testbiotech Christoph Then.
Head of Efs' Group of Experts for Genetically Changeed Plants, Harry Kuiper, and Efsa's other experts have had a contract with the Ilsi Lobist Union for several years now.
He's funded by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the Efs control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
Efsa's prescriptions are said to be consistent with all the stops with Ilsi's documents and thus carry a manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled by the Italian Parliament's office.
This is the second time that Testbiotech points to conflicts of interest.
Recently, a high manager from Efsa, who had no additions or transitional times, passed to the Swiss Syngent Group - and thus changed the sides.
Also a radio call for Central Germany (MDR) recently discovered the EU's personnel link to the industrial lobby, which raised interest both the Ministry of the Environment and the EU Members.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
He works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are highly professionally high, is indicated in one statement.
Experts working for Efs are not required not to have relations with the industry.
But they have to be filed.
Kuiper admits his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of science, industry and policy experts - in addition to an estimate of the risks of biotechnology without lobbyists.
Independent experts like Then criticise that there are currently genetically changed plants in animals without any attempt to feed and that the reaction of genetic plants is not tested for environmental effects.
"We want to know what, for example, will do genetically modified maize in the field," says Then.
Current practice is only testing isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how would they be able to find them?" he asks the plaintiff, Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
Researcher has been researching the technique since 1994 and currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now increasingly influenced or discredited by critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to the concert anymore.
They don't usually publish studies that are critical to companies.
"The mind controls security research", says Hilbeck.
Stone alloy
Uli Gsell also made one, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood outside of Sutton Station, the tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the swamps came and began to push a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Sutton was no longer the same: Thousands have demonstrated against the S21 billion down the station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wings were in ruin.
Breaked up at 6000, 7,000 pieces.
A limestone from Crillsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculpturer in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It spreads out, "A bright and poor stone, a simple and ancient one."
When he cut one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Sutton leads to the forest at Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man dealing with old stones.
He bought everyone that was created during the storm in Sutton.
"It would be a shame if they broke up on a scrotum or disappeared into a deposit," says the office, a wooden booth that was previously a surveillance house.
He's telling us that they've given him and threatened him when he was in September all the papers said he'd bought the rest of the northern wing from the company that's doing the democracy.
He's been talking to S-21s all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for democracy.
And when it's happening, then it's more understandable when the stones continue to be used.
Then he took about 200 S-21 opponents each one of about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece €6.50 to €14.
As a memory, some also in the hope that they will return to it when they are built again.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
About half's still in the woods, the rest's sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from every corner and pulled out of the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Sutton have long changed into "dozens" or as the edges of tails with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political drawer."
He goes into his field car and goes on a drive through his 20-gauge kingdom.
He studied law first, he interrupted study, later biology, then he was interested in computer, and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a rock lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He weighs his treasure from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest merchant with old stones in the Republic.
He's freezing.
In the snow there is an artisticly worked sandstone.
"One belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone of Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite rock."
We're on our way up the forest.
It shows at the meeting: the red sandstone, earlier part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And come on.
"Good travertine."
One time, they owned the quacks of the Necardadion Tribune in Sutton.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from a police presidium in Sutton, a red grenade from the St.
What a job, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about the way the stones were first hand-broken and carried by simple hammers and bull carriages, it becomes completely honorable.
"It would have been a scandal if something like this went wrong."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
A stone dealer today employs 14 people and, besides, a stoner, one statuer, one blacksmith, one glass and one gardener were seated upstairs in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
She has to go to Cologne in a reasonable time.
There will also be stones to save.
High-potential talent fight
There are a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students press salmon bread, tomato soup and sweetness.
Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Volkswagen cars invited the students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they're supposed to talk about the future's car - and, by the way, just get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to compete with the smartest heads as well as VW, succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruits in the most gifted graduates, before they reach the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects focused on practice and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company tries to gain talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department is handing out pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with a VW logo.
He tells hopeful young talents about programs on practice, student jobs, and suggests their way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with the VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can at the same time meet students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-workers."
Such co-operation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
The news is, he's so openly fighting for students.
"Jinak was a rather substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is probably even harder.
In many sectors companies are no longer able to choose their employees from long crowds of candidates.
On the other hand, they must try and try to attract particularly highly qualified labour.
In particular, graduates of engineering industries have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data, the German VDI engineers were left in October with 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the prediction, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow.
Roman Dict's hunting talent for KPMG's audit and advisory company.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find a way according to GPS coordination.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the US next year.
Participants can also see KPMG branches and meet the company.
Before that, he will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème will fly from many interested parties to the USA.
In a battle for High Potentials in universities, they will pay according to Dicts, more and more hard laws.
"We want to distinguish with our Race from the others."
"One single sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dict's talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of similar events last year."
"Some of us will soon finish their studies and plan to go to work," he says.
In addition to direct discussions on campus, small and medium-sized companies are primarily presented in the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"For example, on Intersolar", reports Shita Stübe, head of personnel department of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonnie company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently 35 positions are written on the company’s website.
"Now it's just complicated, putting loose places."
"It's a lot of time and money," she says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities such as Freiberg University.
"The professors tell us that it is possible to practice or write a diploma job."
Solar specialist doesn't have expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"The big bands are often unable to offer," says the Head of Personal Affairs of Stübe.
For a long time, money has not been a major role to play in searching for work.
Flexible working time, caring for children or good opportunities for the process are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied a study of the Great Place Institute to Work 55. place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it shall ask the co-workers how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and shall monitor the staff’s framework conditions.
The head of the Stübe Personal Department hopes that the location will bring her points for job seekers.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all internal measures.
"The best way to see itself as an attractive employer is through its own employees," he says.
This is referred to as the internal Employer Branding, i.e. the deployment of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they'll do ad from themselves to their employer between friends and friends.
"It's like a game with a string," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil wells
During the following years, they will not escape from the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico new oil wells.
The Washington government issued a corresponding ban, thereby canceling the earlier plans at its final date.
Also, new wells are banned from the Atlantic coast.
Minister of Interior Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay at least the following five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
This is what the supporters are trying to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supply.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who carries responsibility for a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of applications.
The investigation committee that Obama has assigned should present the results during December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar cancelled the ban on drilling, which he paid from the explosion.
They subsequently submitted different oil companies applications for new drilling purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by tighter checks and strict safety regulations.
At the moment, the control authority, which has pointed itself to many corruption claims, is substantially reforming itself.
At the same time Obama announced that it would cancel the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry now openly warns that a more stringent regulation will substantially reduce the volume of the oil that is in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for gas and oil growth", the result of the current survey in the field of consulting the company BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what regulation changes."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until appeal - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down.
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like pump: billions of pure oil has destroyed the natural environment in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't be embarrassed", calms the Journalist environmental activist: "You'll get a lot of oil in front of the lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who is rambling on the breasts of water, surrounded by smudges: this scene is active in a water gloss with rainbow colors almost nice.
The fact that brown clots of oil under the surface are not visible.
Previously, she collected enough potnel in the container, told Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetta River.
In the meantime, the water running slowly became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil was poured into a huge bottled area from a broken lead.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: Ogoni area, located in the heart of the river Delta Niger, belongs to one of the most affected areas in the world.
On the way across the river, mangrinic swamps with lots of side lines are only known for the entire range of the trigger.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of light water brown mash and whoever immerses his hand in the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The root of the mangores is drawn from the ground as black pharmacies, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we are looking for flocks of birds, which occur commonly in wet areas: Once the engine is shut down on the boat, it will come to light in the former paradise, where it smells like the pump, scary silence.
"What is happening here is an ecological war leadership," says the sad Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battle field, where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe were drawn up here in the 1980s by Ken Sara-Wiva, who had to stop production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to Ogoni: while it is daily benefiting from a three-size delta of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drills and 7000 kilometres of lead more than two million black gold barrels, there is oil fields in Ogoni ladem, for the group this situation is too unstable.
Each few hundred meters shall be drawn from the water of steel construction as bizarre sculptures: "Wedding Trees", so that they are very much called the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty in the sea.
The head of a drill hole breaks every minute, tells Akpobari, and then flows the constant stream of oil into the water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two billion liters in the delta have run out of the ecosystem for 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that ran into the sea near Alaska during the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest disasters of the environment in human history.
There are disputes that continue to be responsible for the persistent environmental disaster.
While the Shell Group calls sabotaging and organized oilft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental securityists are talking about cracking heads of wells and tights as the main cause.
Shell requires a lot less security regulations in Nigeria than it is in the world by the custom, a concern by the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of faults on the line are "very many times higher than others".
In a place that looks away like a deserted, oily workshop under the wide sky, it is removed from the mangorgers of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck of oil.
Under one of many barrels, which are partly associated with lead, partially irradiated by the earth, burning fire: illegal small refineries.
Oil is heated in the barrel over the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, he runs out of the lead into a capture pot of gasoline, later drops at the end of the kerosin and finally oil.
This way Michael and his four co-workers make every day up to four barrels of 300 liters: "Let's make like 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The residents of the delta are using chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still be exceeded by illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "Bunkers", which connect to lead everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, in the whole area of the Niger Delta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of oil daily.
But only a negligible part of the temporarily stored raw materials is illegally depleted: the largest share of the organised criminal networks to which politicians and high positions of military leaders, to tankers and to sell them on the world market.
The debate whether residents and their intervention or the lax method of production caused the disaster is considered an activist of Akpobari to be a purely academic.
"If they did not consider oil companies an intruder, and if they did not perfectly destroy the life nature of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, neither theft and illegal refiners."
In the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so humbled that it only affects the departure of the group: "It may be possible to show other peoples like the Chinese as better."
Michael's going to calm down.
"The greatest time for you to disappear," says the muscle manufacturer.
"Sometimes soldiers may come."
If a special military unit found them, they don't have a prison risk, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"That cursed thing got our country in all respects down to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigations have discovered a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 obviously has a huge safety defect.
The investigators found a possible construction mistake during the survey of the machine, which could lead to a "catastropheral engine outage".
The Qantas air carrier wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The traveling airbus of Qantas had probably better luck at the emergency landing in November than it has been known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a great safety defect on the engines of certain A380s during its investigations - and now warns against a possible construction error.
Perhaps the defect would have had severe consequences: in a single oil connection, cracks could arise due to wear, this Thursday in the ATSB statement published.
This could lead to a "catastrophatic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land emergency in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British Turkish producers.
It filed grounds for action against the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against this company.
Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released, and they damaged the area of the carrier.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be changed worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines concerned.
Security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesman of the ATSB Martin Dolan.
The lack of security has been considered to be important enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline left its fleet A380 for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-story aircraft is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Global snowfall causes chaos in transport
Germany was all white: almost all over the country at night snowed.
In many roads, there is chaos, linkages of trains and planes are being disturbed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night at freezing snow temperatures - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, there are up to 15 centimetres of snow in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, transport is strongly limited.
On A7 at Flensburg, road service was still in place, but it did not take over the newlywed snow.
There was still a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The BSH is expected on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Šlesvik-Holstein in the morning by stormy floods with the state of water of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow baths have caused significant problems in Saxony on highways and public roads.
According to the centres of bad weather Meteomedia was therefore the degree of alarm in Saudi Switzerland on the purple - at all the highest degree.
From part of there, 30 centimeters of the new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the curtains.
A couple of trucks and personal cars stayed there last night.
Also in Saxony-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported major road problems.
The wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic on A2.
There were troubles in Durins because of snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there is a great deal of trouble in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsk, Durinsk and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the tracks, the overturned trees on the tracks, or the broken top lines and bends.
The remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Saalfeld, D.C.E., he had to stop an I.E.E. to Munich.
165 passengers got in a train from firemen and rescuers of wool boards, food and drink.
Snow Wind War across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled in large German airports due to snow winds.
According to the spokesperson, the information centres for years have already been reported from Munich’s cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, according to spokesman Fraport, for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
Just a few passengers left unconnected at the airport, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
On many roads, there was an accident on Wednesday night.
In the evening one truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holštýnsk.
The driver was easily hurt.
Due to the snowed road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: the truck was also captured at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were hurt on the train - a route from Bayreuthu to Nuremberg remained closed until morning.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after Aschaffenburg and her car turned to a skid road.
However, the Meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light request, and therefore it will be raised during light winds.
But the wind will go down.
Only by the Baltic Sea will the fast winds with the strength of the winds.
But it's going to be a lot of cold-- locally, up to 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one news contribution, the buyer bank is looking for two towers with offices at the main office in Frankfurt.
The property could take up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its own group headquarters: the twin towers in the French banking district have upgraded; while the bankers were turning into their old jobs again.
Now, however, it seems that the financial company wants the renovation costs back again - and is looking for buyers for both clouds, as reported by the 'Funncial Times Deutschland' with the appeal to the spokesperson.
The spokesman didn't name any of the reasons for the sale planned.
"We also examine whether it is more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again", he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany is giving up again after a short time.
The Bank took over the twin tower only in mid 2007 for EUR 272 million from its equity investors and then repaired them cost-effectively.
The energy reconstruction swallowed around EUR 200 million, according to data.
I guess the bank would bring a lot of money.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the changed towers at around 500 million euros, according to the news text.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building would again sell itself to the assets of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousand thousands grieve for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of the fallen miners in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down.
Still unable to release the dead because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a strong explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners from 17 to 62 years of age were flooded below.
In the shaft where the disaster occurred, the probe was launched, but did not show any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not take place because of safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came out of the fact that miners no longer had a chance to survive.
Still couldn't release the dead.
They have now honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people in sunny weather were gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They were quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the monuments of the covered miners, the helmets, the lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal items, such as clothes and surf boards, have found their place here.
The state government buildings had a half-boarded flag.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out of the "global country" to the surface, said to participants the memorial event minister John Key, New Zealand.
"But they never came home."
He can't say good-bye to his son until he saw his dead, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was confounded in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives, several foreign diplomats were also involved.
British and South African miners were also infected during the explosion on November 19.
Rescuers began by fireing inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as poison gases melt, it begins to cool down high temperatures, told the journalists the police President Gary Knowles.
Damn it, warriors!
Is it good for an art movie?
The Nicolas Winding Refn director tries to conquer the old border again with his fighting epos "Walla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he was filming "Wallalla Rising"?
The captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his enemies and killed almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men who seek bloody actions because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and even their enemies live insides from the belly when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, will not say a word during all the film, and the other characters will bring at most one or two sentences, or they will be thrown off to the terrible dying screams.
Otherwise, they keep silent and move in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the culture of the Viking world about thousands of years ago.
The film is ideal for grown-up cinemas with an interest in existability and very quiet camera shots.
It's good to have a movie of more target groups, it's only a shame to rule each other out.
The Winding Refn director, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a giftary version of director Quentin Tarantin, but is stomping to make his works closer to either more humorous by the main current or less brutal artistic audience.
Most artistic cinema supporters are likely to be discouraged by a forceful brain and internality everywhere.
The supporters of action films are bored at the latest at the time when the Single comes out for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem, and will remain hanging forever in the airless and silent before the man lives to America and remain silent there.
So there's no wonder in Germany that the "Wallalla Rising" didn't get into the cinema and now it was only released on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of beautiful shots, but also because behind the individual façade, places to broken blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this movie, it's not about dialogues or a precise story, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a movie.
And that's not for the viewer of escape.
Refn won't give him a moment of release and slowly choke it with its freezing images and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, the incorrigible hatred that comes from the hearts of a figure.
Only a little blond boy, who helps One-Eye, leaves something like innocence, everyone else being driven by evil.
Of all the singlest heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become the time for enemies and transitional allies to the warrior from hell, perhaps the ambassador of the Devil.
He's a mess, but maybe it's only for the corrupt ones.
"Wallalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthwork
The IAA nuclear energy office has a new alert to the secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country prevents expression - and does not even allow controls.
About midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli battle planes F-15 I will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphratu; the nearest city is 30 kilometres away and its name is Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA), its name appears when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley, which turns from the current.
On the basis of a message from the US-American Foreign Secret Service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby el-Kibar village, would well have thrown into the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s doesn't fit for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unscrupulous satellite images.
With computer animation, it explains where the components of the reactor before destruction could be, it is meant to be a smaller copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon Nuclear Center.
In addition, there were still photographs submitted showing the building close to or even from the inside.
The reactor said it was shortly before it started, but without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, they don't know much more than they did back then, even the puzzles got bigger.
Former U.S. president George W. Bush recently published in his memory that the CIA was very sure that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but basically had no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence intelligence services in Europe are even more careful and only talk about a "successive reactor", even if the CIA's presentation considers it "consistent".
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAA.
When asked how certain he is that he has a reactor ahead of him, he answered the UN's high diplomat in summer, IAEA said he has "the amount of material to ask questions".
The drought allegedly "non-used military buildings" was quickly removed, and also properly balanced the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, the IAA team was led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen at the el-Kibar trace of uranium, which was made by people.
In addition, via a Member State, IAA received satellite photographs of commercial sellers from the time of the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these do not appear on the market because they exclusively bought an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed she has never had a secret nuclear program and has never built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, expressed himself to Damascus.
But that turned IAA out after the particle analysis.
Damašek has since refused to discuss things - as well as satellite shots.
In addition, he bans the second inspection at el-Kibar and access to the concerns of the bombed buildings.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment," confirmed recently the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at that time.
The examination of this case goes without delay since June 2008 and "is increasing to a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office" as he admitted a high Western diplomat in the headquarters of IAA in Vienna - it is a serious breach of the nuclear weapons ban agreement that the IAA is looking at.
The IAA considers it the key to progress in the case of another three devices to be "functioning" with the alleged reactor and, unlike it, still exist.
However, the auditors have not yet established, nor have the equipment concerned, nor what function they have, or why they are suspicious.
According to the information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAA is in internally referred to as Marj as-Sullan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, being exported again by nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isisis) identified these objects and found on satellite images complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or near the military base - that's why Syria's approach to these three places is rejected.
In Vienna it was said that the Syrians were afraid of so-called fishing expedition - that the IAA would be in advance sent out to track the military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. Secret Service facility.
The IAA has also satellite images that it transported material here and there between these three places and the square near Euphrat.
In Vienna, he said a high Western diplomat that at least one arranged should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
But there are no "no evidence of sensible activity", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes that are necessary for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by an uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from, and where plutonium should be left off on the bomb later, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the ruins that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the earth hundreds of cargo trucks, no one seems to have information about where that barrel got there.
Only a few kilometres from the el-Kibar remote and on the other side of the Euphrates lying salt mine al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
Former Inspector Robert Kelley put him in contact with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the reputable Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, the images from the universe show that after the IAA requested access, Syria performed on all suspicious locations earthwork and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAA spent many months creating a plan for the revisions that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only this effort shows how much the interest of the revisions is.
In the meantime, damasek refused this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats at Vienna were calmed by the fact that the reactor is destroyed, and that is why it does not burn, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been speaking for several months about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means that the Vienna nuclear office has to take control.
Chief IAA Yukiya Amano, who would have to suggest inspection, although he was already talking about "the possibilities I'm about in the future", but he's so far hesitated.
This option poses a high risk: On one hand, most of the governors in the IAA Governing Council are required and many of the 35 countries represented do not have any interest in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love at the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on a nameless real estate in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote a script herself, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He doesn't know much more yet - but it makes him restless.
It is always said that the woman who is Muslim will fall in love during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosen women protested immediately, so the planned production from Sarajevo to Hungary was quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film was filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but still protests in Bossen.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through UN-organizations to assist refugees in UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informed the Boston newspaper - Jolie is also the UN Ambassador's UN-organization to assist refugees.
She's not exactly diplomatic - offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
Meetings must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In camps where there was rape, love stories were not performed and Jolie's attitude toward the victim was revealed to be quite a scenario.
So her organization recommended the UN-organisation to assist refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, informs Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosen Ministry of Culture, which had been given to read its script, has allowed smaller tangories in Sarajevo to film - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author points out that in her film there are no political intentions that she has engaged with great efforts in the conflict in Yugoslavia that he wants to demonstrate the terrible consequences of war and to give space to all the parties involved.
Due to its content, it remains vague.
On the Internet, there is another version of the film, which sounds really very different: lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when it is like a bosen Muslim tow into a Serbian camp where it serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the rape machine will fall in love with its compatriot."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie insists that there is a pressure on her which "is not fair and is based on incorrect information".
Now they can free them from Hollywood: by publishing illegally on the Internet her script as they have done so many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for Iry.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates too much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream for the sound of loud music, buttocks.
Bailey-Pub in South Korea's Cork screams because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
"Pive pong" is called a bizarre theatre and can be won by 500 euros as a winning premium and to that ticket to Las Vegas at the World Cup in a beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and a slow informant, it doesn't work very well together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, react to the difficult questions that the future will bring.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, going to New Zealand in January.
"I've got a weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "as soon as she has gained her dream job as Eventmaster, perhaps it's a good sign", says a young man and smiles.
Because of their bad home prospects, they've tried to get their luck abroad by two of the three Tanner siblings.
His sister Yvonne, social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT adviser in London.
Boys leave: Just like Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
The 100,000 Irish will leave the country in a timely fashion, predicting experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They even count until 2015, with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar extermination wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of growth, which has brought great well-being to Ireland, there is now once again growing in dissatisfaction.
The economic crisis is primarily a young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only the rise.
The loss of employment and social retreat seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needed money, money was too much.
In the meantime, however, there are three out of ten men and women who have been unemployed for 30 years.
In Irish Times, there are many letters of readers complaining, "In Ireland, everything goes uphill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - who can, he goes away, and our country loses the generation."
"Later please turn off."
A law student named Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future blackly, because the government says it's only a lie and a young person who offers no visions for the future.
"They reduce minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says 20-year-old.
She's watching her classmates get wet from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she's gonna have to move out in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this subject positive.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers general service on work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent chance of making the first steps on the career ladder", says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: To work abroad are not galleys, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan's been known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house at Gelsenkirchen.
In January she goes to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan to the house.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy", says when for the first time in a long time goes beyond the threshold of his own house.
"I make money in Germany on a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in."
They laugh and walk in cool rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, there's a lot of expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house together with his sister four years ago for 300,000 euros - 100 percent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he goes down hot tea and says, "I don't have kids that I have to live and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like the lamenting that he can hear so often right now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not a bit as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's also had a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for New Zealand for him and his girlfriend too?
But there is one more thing that concerns him enough these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she's going to go to a bachelor party.
"No emotion," he says, "and he'll drink a lot of beer.
"Bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it an exit party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Normal practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity raises greater concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more powerful than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobaro, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been regularly held since 1995, it can therefore monitor changes in positions across the entire area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of them is that Latin America is rather happy in its mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries at the edge of Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most popular areas, are the convictions of the Democrats, which withdraws the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area have expressed satisfaction with the fact that democracy works in their country in practice, it is the same number as last year, but compared with 25% in 2001, it is a large increase (see 3).
About 34% stated that they trust the snow in their country and 45% trust in the government, again it is the same figures as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America undermined the economic crisis.
The aid was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and dropped again to 32% this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its moving President Luize Inacia Luly da Silva is reflected in a broad sense for progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and violent crime has worsened.
Only the second time since the surveys began, they see more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% says that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decline compared to 38% of the previous year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in increasing aid for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% from 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there supports private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a leading country in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without any change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in a large part of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
criticised elections
No one expected the general election to be perfect for Haiti on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
The elections meant filling urns and recurring votes, voting tickets scattered after channels, broken election rooms and intimidation.
Call room opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved due to the January earthquake, were circling around and trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several supposed predecessors, shouted that this was fraud and called after the election had been lifted.
Protests, some of them violent, have spread throughout the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a highly built UN official in Haiti, said that "it was a pretty good choice in many respects."
The observers from the organization of the American states and the Caribbean community carefully said that "they would not believe that these irregularities, whatever they were serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are bound by Rene Préval, to the non-popular President and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Miranda Manigat, former First Lady, resigned from their original call to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support between the voters, will be marked by the electoral commission for achieving a decisive fight.
Due to an epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that electoral participation would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of their disorganization, they were prevented.
Some 250,000 identity cards that are necessary for the vote remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And then it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
After the tip to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, from the sympathy of the public when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet, the conversion of this success in a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year may depend on the fact that Mrs Fernández's mourning will give up his late husband, predecessor and political partner Neistor Kirchner's indiscretion.
And everything will be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had in the custom of drawing up budgets that undermined tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income according to their wishes.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized during Mr. Kirchner's death to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which were involved in the faction and accusation of the government from corruption), Congress could not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to swear," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, while the president will have more space to spend as much as he pleases.
The economy is overheated: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about numbers that are approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the Bureau in 2003, when Argentina was providing economic collapse, set the priority to growth and poverty reduction rather than to control inflation.
He refused to act with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, a statistical agency that proceeded to monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now be dying of this policy?
She called for a meeting between private companies and trade leaders.
And her officials say they want to cut the wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was encouraged by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on large devalvecies in 2002.
This could be why President Fernández is making sure he wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government set up an agreement with bond holders who had previously rejected the restructuring of the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
It now faces President Fernández's agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Bouda, the Minister of Economic Affairs announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" in order to design a new national consumer-price index to remind the introduction to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the term of office when her husband is no longer next to her.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from a middle class that's tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether it will be necessary to break up many views that her husband held in politics.
Half Encouragement to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the land.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters voted for the mayors and councils in five urban districts, which may be considered to be a wider evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have been held firmly and strong in business relations, including the agreement on partly free trade, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but just close.
Although his side of Kuomintang (KMT) ended with a victory of three of the five mayor's offices, she couldn't win most of the votes.
In addition to this Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is driven by the greater independence of Taiwan, has won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT side.
If this was about the presidential election, the President would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his votes has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the party was together with the KMT on city councils.
The elections were taken as the majority of taiwan elections, which include deaf electoral trucks and mass meetings with flags with sprayed girls.
Part was even a mandatory mystery attempt to attack.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was ambitious for KMT candidates on the night before the election.
The man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
Bizarny was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, Head of DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicions fall on the DPP and leads the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps China was the only big campaign winner.
It was remarkable how it remained in the background the question of the mainland itself.
Instead, the candidates became concerned about plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
KMT therefore tends to avoid government ties in Beijing.
But this time, DPP also dropped her anti- Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and awareness that China is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
From the government of Beijing, it can be expected that it will continue in commercial bribes, together with its strategy to attract Taiwan back to the herd.
China did not waste its time sending the Negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
He'd love to see political integration, too, but on the agenda.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP side found herself in any case.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison based on charges against corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate of clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a candidate for the president of DPP, such as Su Tseng-change, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the public that her party represents a "trustful alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprising approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In the statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for the president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's evaluation was bad, even though it was an excessive pace of economic growth; KMT's candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unbelievingness seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a deepening abyss between the rich and the poor.
A spokesperson from KMT says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local offices.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan's attachment to friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Thai citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Nominees at Grammy Prize: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
At the request of the President and the people must legally notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer, whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Prize ceremony for peace in 2009, is referred to as one of the surprises of Grammy prices this year with nominations in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy rules, when an artist must not issue more than three albums before "is determined by the public identity of the artist."
Its ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and the dense hand with the elements of pop, funku and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that was recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy, who have been looking for a similar jazz work in this category for the last years.
Other jurors of Grammy are rightly valued Vijay Iyer Trio's album "History" in the category of an instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody 4B and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a conservative favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on the HBO series "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
A wild group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large files, where in competition the permanent chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octate "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the bass player can have a free hand as a bandman.
Nominee Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey runs in classic music category
The nominees on classical music have a wide picture of musicians and composers from around the world at 53th annual prices.
The head of the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machin" for piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with the number of three points.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance of award.
The nominees in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominee for the classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symphony No.3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castart" describing various artists; and Verdi "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of operas, Berg and "Lulu" are nominated from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaiija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Family Shedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for the Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appsassionatame Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 at the performances recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the Esa-Pekka Salonena tacto.
Approximately 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkov, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandoline artist Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the notes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinski's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination are the pianist Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominees of vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Viviana Genaux and Meash Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition the classic won the nomination of sopranicist Jesse Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned Mosque in Temecule is approved by the planning committee
The planned Mosque in Temecule has obtained unanimous support from the local planning commission for more than five hours often of passionate public testimony.
The critics attacked the project promoting terrorism and leading to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A number of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center at Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It's what's always about to win justice."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"He that is against, only cry loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time discussed with people who were for or against the centre. These voices were evenly divided, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the press website.
"There is no America," there is one comment.
"We are Planet ape with Socha freedom fell into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also launched protests in other parts of the country, including around Ground Zero, the places of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imm Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
Its religious community, reading around 135 families, had been living in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse space that it rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
A new bridge of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean architecture style will also have two minerals and will grow up to a height of 43 feet.
It should take place at 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of Chaparal High School.
The oponents may still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new life-types on Earth or elsewhere
Discovering a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expanding space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps further.
The researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that are outside the main elements that have been considered and basic so far.
"This organism has dual powers."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'memorative' life," commented this fact by Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, co-author of news that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
Long was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growth after phosphorus replaces the arsenal.
"You will begin to wonder what else is possible," says Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the news.
This finding is important for finding life outside of Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the news on this news, published to discuss it, which did not highlight the details of the finding, caused a wide speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
Discovering that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' may not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows replacing one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Asstrobiological Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because he shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it was considered that a microbe exposed to both elements may be able to replace one by one.
"The arena is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can be very difficult to separate from each other."
"Although the arsenic is so different that as well as phosphorus does not work. When it enters the organism, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and present them with an increasing concentration of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but since they can survive also with the replacement of the arsenic, the possibility of a form of life that uses arsenic can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or a month, where the arsenal is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant to microbiology at the University of Florida, declared that the idea of an arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but never found an example on which this fact would be successful.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he might have been used by earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to make life, not just the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," Foster said, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research has been supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs that someone stole from Bellflower's motel were found, and he informed the Los Angeles Sheriff on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akits and the large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower Motel 6, the authorities communicated.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon and there were two dogs left late on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is, dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which locality, he didn't share detailed information about finding them.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not affected to comment on the case.
They were very happy when they found themselves at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old bitch Didi, were unharmed, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
The other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions planned in days before the exhibition AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop on almost a month's steam travel after dog shows.
Peek and Rickard registered to the motel on Monday night.
They often sleep in the motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer puppy, Parson Russell Terrier and the British firemen - who stayed in the motel room with them.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little so dogs can have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported theft of the car at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who leads them to the missing dogs, and dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
Thursday, it wasn't clear whether the prices would be awarded.
Lev is ready to scream again now that MGM restructuring has final approval from the Court of Justice
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so that she could start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge New York officially blessed the "prepackaged" scheme of creditors to make up for about $5 billion of debt and clean the way for 86 years by an old entertainment company that focuses on film production and television shows.
Fourthly, the fact that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. audition does not remain MGM legal obstacles to relaunching the founder Spyglas Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the leading leaders of the visited studio.
The number of employees decreases approximately 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM does not suddenly come from Capital 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees to the planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's a connection to an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On that August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a trade expert known for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve financial problems with MGM and 140 college creditors took a lot longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed that they would give the company for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion of US dollars plus the finances that creditors demanded.
In spring this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor by the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from the audition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive millions of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received 1.2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper's companies, who are spending their services running the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, so called "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production in MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, which will be the book "Hobit" together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, owned by approximately 18% of MGM debts, sought the possibility of combining the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your budget in balance
The leader of this year's candidate is the most amazing toy of iPad, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX rounds for $99 and one game Kinect costs just as much as 10 coral troubles or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there's a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys had much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While relatively less new toys appeared with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased, as is toys with chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are otherwise marked.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years old) have been stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
At one press, the animal will release the tone and the second press will start creating a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you're done working, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animator doll on Elmo Live Technology, which can play the game Simon Says and also manages a monthly walking thanks to my innovative footing with wheel blocking.
Kids are testing Mickey's dance instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of voice control.
If you're a kid of the '80s, maybe you can remember Alphie, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn the car into a fun business with a funny workbook.
If you're going on a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is about the cheapest variant with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective a Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Lapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And in the end, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes which are not larger than a match box, each has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competition in improvized word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest degree, two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented in the playfuls.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credit at Club Penguin store at any of the two items.
This could include colloidal skates or Puffle animals.
A little bit bigger than the brush of your tooth card is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years), the latest of the microrobots to the button battery.
The brouk moves quickly on 12 vibrational silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny if you make a maze out of the cubes and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Implementation of gentler police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked across the square, strictly controlled his orders and gave orders in half-inclusively with military authority.
He wanted the female members - Chinese strong enforcers of the city order, accused and despised for their hard actions and adversity in violence - to mediate a certain impression of the dorks of the surrounding.
"Stay straight!"
Hurry up!
Show them, whispers, "What nice girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants were in sight.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted like a ruler.
Four headgears fit perfectly on the hairs that are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look on average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to restore the picture of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have college education.
The province of Guangdong changed the grey-green uniform to an allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced precise views for strong weapons: in 2009 he stated that 50 officers surrounded a wheelchair with snacks and looked at the owner after half an hour and left.
Xindu, a city district with 680 000 people in Chengdu, chose an operation for the main picture.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his city police by 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show also the softer woman side, apart from the gross side of the police.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson alone would have trouble getting into secret Chinese town groups.
They would argue criticism for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media normally capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province cut off an unparticipated viewer to death after he used his cell phone to produce how they began to deal with protest against the dump.
Last year, police training was carried out in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual described how effectively to beat the perpetrator with no signs of blood.
This year, an underground melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered left brain injuries.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese policemen attacking street sellers.
"Chengguan spooked the government," China Daily, national edition, reported next year after further discussion on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
The skeptics say that this is not enough access.
After the period in October, he was interested in eight new female policemen, the founder of The Beijing Evening News was concerned about whether women have real responsibilities or are merely distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The period required female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age with good character and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - i.e. more than 1.6 metres.
Service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The shareholders claim that the work is mentally too demanding for women over 25 years.
"The image of theirs is an important thing," said one named cop on Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external quality, which they then determine, belong among them height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the line of character and "inward quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "Everyone that will be vases will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are common in China also for other work positions, for both sexes.
Just like a demand for relative facial features.
Which means that the question of good thinking is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
It certainly does not apply to disability or frosty.
"He cannot allow us to serve a lame or slender man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is keeping a patrol on Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years of age, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that the emphasis on her appearance might have a sexuality, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked an irony look.
Her co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They do not object to their limited performance, because their career ambitions are greater than simply launching traders into a alley where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on wheels, trying to sell as many dumplings as possible and tofu bowls before they are banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you this many times!" said Miss Xu when he started running away from the marketer, and he left his bike with a noodles cart for a while.
Politicians describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20 who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's police officers have no authority as their male counterparts to entertain the sellers.
They can only threaten to report that fact to their male leader.
The tendency then is to protect them from sudden public expressions of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors of police killing a dealer.
More than ten police officers or police officers have been injured in nighttime; 14 government vehicles have been turned over or burned.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from Baoguang's quiet square, where police patrols had that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the pavement place inside the shop, as required by the regulations.
The wheel owner could've cried like he wanted.
A 15-minute distance from the police, looking angry, with elbows against vehicles and quickly away with a motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed in the back, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like the female policemen, the coordinators are men over 40 years old who have no more than an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and coaling image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in business.
"Most of all, it's the public who's gonna start it."
Procurators will not blame Senator Ensign
Procurators of the Ministry of Justice purged Senator John Ensign from criminal charges involving his affair with his former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced on Wednesday to the senator.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat Mr Ensign, the Needas Republican, faced, and which was, until the date of the scandal, considered to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 president.
Mr Ensign's office said he was pleased with a decision that followed almost one year after an investigation.
The senator could still face the disciplined management of the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that he is not planning to press charges against him on this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed there were serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in New York Times in October 2009 stated that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to provide a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, of a senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier at Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby for them, so much as to report documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently an assistant to Mr Ensign, he was excluded from the lobbying law of his former employer or Senate for a year.
Experts on ethics claim that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were before an affair with friends, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
The evidence that was published "is revealed to be a clear case of preparation for violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, Washington's lawyer, who specializes in defending clients who are investigating the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign's case, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialized in ethics said that the Ministry was careful about political actions, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to put an action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of a charge of doubting the state's attorney.
Federal prosecutors "have clearly hidden their weapons", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Organisation for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm who filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the matter.
"It basically shows that the law does not apply to high-profile government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr Ensign, told him in an interview that on Monday he was called by the State Attorney of Justice and then on the second day, and told him that the Ministry did not find any charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutor in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated on Wednesday's statement, "He negotiated in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he gave to the state representatives.
"I am not pleased to present the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decisions," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop an investigation of independent complaints in which the ethical group claims that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents amounting to $96.000 broke the federal electoral law.
The electoral committee stated that there was not enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was the NV Energy company, the main weak company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist, head of Mr. Ensign's staff, John Lopez, had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "bulled" to the Ministry of Interior about the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another non-governmental client, Allegiant Air and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange an appointment on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for a lobbying work.
When last year's report on the Afrea first appeared, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned to his function, as in the order of the fourth Republican Head of the Senate.
After many months of stagnation Mr Ensign, two weeks ago, he told reporters that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the object of an investigation into the crime of his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"The Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his work in the name of the weak people," she said further.
The challenge of Cheshire is turning to Twitter
Half a dozen wrote in the courtrooms.
One minute after a minute, they sent messages of terrible testimony through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that over 140 000 reports on Twitter were engaged in rape and attachment of children to beds in the house that was lit.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to kill three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, was to be officially terminated with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayese's lawyers have already brought an appeal with applications and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter of major reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread immediate penetration of information with stimulating details then introduced a jury in a decision in the sense of influence of the public opinion.
This claim could be made by the judge to consider whether the launch of new technologies would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced with this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of a fair trial for individuals," said Mr. Ulmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the process Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of State briefly rejected the statement concerning the proceeds from last week and the fact that the media were "inspectively controlled" and that there was no evidence showing that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that news of known cases can raise questions about justice in the process.
In the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States of America, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, "carnival atmosphere" was involved in the process of communication.
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration for the TV show and the movie "Urblík".
Some lawyers said that the appeals that reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be needed to determine the way of communication from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, Professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and wrote a report that was performed freely.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be taken into consideration by the idea that restrictions of immediate communication in the direction of judicial court can make a fairer process.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many attorneys of Mr. Hayes who would be able to argue for years to hold on to the execution of the judgment.
For example, the defenders also claim that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a presupposability when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential judges by showing them criminal photographs of terror in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by photographs of the victim by Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge misrepresented a judge who was critical to the state representatives, and that he did not correctly impose more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They took a stand against the verdict last month, that the case was dominated by the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of candidates for Governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly murmuring the flames of emotions in the case of this case.
"The media, camera and reporter's day in court," wrote a lawyer, "there was something here in New Haven that hasn't been seen yet, and perhaps it's also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more stimulating than the reports mentioned later, and from their point of view the judicial police should manage the scope of other processes.
However, some lawyers requested appeals with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard in order to spread the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "representing the Sheppard case versus Maxwell 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was remarkable by its insult and negativeism, a small amount of courtesy came up in Washington this week.
Is this the first flag real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusionous moment before a quick return to party fight in the capital?
On Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and parliamentary heads did not give rise to any fundamental discovery of the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences in the views of the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than an empty episode of the party’s side.
The central public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close synergies over a few months have created mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological abyss that the members are still dividing.
And it's kind of hard to say that she started her new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they probe each other signs of collegality and compromise, trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and free patience against renewed party war.
Therefore, on Tuesday meetings and subsequent evaluations were also conducted with minimum requirements or charges.
Philosopheric differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the ratios that last two years are in place.
Whether it is a question of taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were made by Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the elections.
The election was tossed by a striker's emotions, and then they kept quiet.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to discuss at meetings, Republicans and democratics have a small chance to find solutions.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one thinks it's favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, whether permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because the Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for Mayan, while unemployed people reject unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's negotiations in the White House, more optimism is seen as regards possible agreements on these issues, together with the ratification of a new opening contract.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls for January.
Rather, there is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"The fact that things are going to happen that need to be done is that psychology will return in a short perspective to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely extended - to the fact that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between present and 2012 as the shadow box, when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the making up of new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
The Republican leaders now face the dangers of respite, know that they have to act according to their promises and must reduce government expenditure and repeal the new law on health care.
These supplementary lines are clear in initial reactions to recommendations on deficits that include reform of the tax law and increase in certain taxes, increase of retirement age and reduction of expenditure.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, they have, to exert pressure on the deficit of public programs in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as official recommendations and thus to fight to this number as close as possible.
The biggest opposition among elected officials in the jury who suggest that, in the case of financial questions, we have, at least today, small foundations or the will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first begins next year in the form of party conflicts, when the Republicans invite Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, when the period of greater cooperation will be followed.
What's to do with the shift?
Public opinion.
There are many evidence that, despite the partiality of the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see two sides that work together.
If it could go to the heel as it was in 1995, then both parties will be very careful to monitor the public’s response.
Whoever he threatens to reduce votes, he will probably change course and seek compromise.
It could be an optimistic view of things.
Stranickness and direction are now larger than it was in the mid '90s, and it turns out that a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans was created than was the case with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay to more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
However, it will cost much effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
The American documentary is drawn up by Moscow as a refuge in corruption
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues part of the bribes and security charges that come on the way to Kremlin, passed the American embassy in Russia on records from February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings, which help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate shops but also from organised crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical office" - will marry when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The recording sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at the time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was called back in October by President Dmitry Medveveveve, but from then on, we can only see minimal changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Biaturina, who owns the prominent design company, have been constantly denying corruption charges for many years, and won several charges for false charges for such charges.
In September he said to the Russian television station when asked about a proven witness about corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's shit."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn to the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet with such details in such a manner, in the embassy's report, and it is also unheard of doing diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with the criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunction' and confirm that the government operates more as a kleptocrat than as a government," says the report.
"The criminal elements are enjoying the so-called 'crisha' (terterms of the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'the roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the State Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in government red tape of Moscow.
"Analytics identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and Milice are on second level."
"And finally at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill empty places in certain areas, as the city does not provide services."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the biggest firms and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "The owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (rare than from organised crime groups) since they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in exchange."
The record says that while money is complex, protection alone can already be in trouble; even those who pay may be arrested sometimes.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their trades under various excuses are closed.
Medveň talked about fighting corruption a few times, but he admitted he made only little progress.
The embassy's report is talking about men taking bags, probably stuffed cash, to Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption Medved has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's research team Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of political class because political classes no longer exist in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power distribution, corruption is inevitable, he said.
The Indian estimate that Russia's corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is lined up at 154th place in a recent survey on global perception of non-governmental corruption of Transparency International (the land is classified from at least the most corrupt).
The revelation of the report by the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow in the late evenings, certainly did not trigger enthusiasm in the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be charged with Moscow’s shortcomings, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on how to solve the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been fakes and responded angryly to the statement that American diplomats called Batman and Medvew Robin.
"The truth of the whole matter is that this is our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it was going to be done with such arrogantness, with such pressure, you understand, so unethically."
Veterans of the Red Khmérs are forced to deal with the past
The director of the Anlong Veng High School of the man who built it, leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok school.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "cutler" for his brutality during the Red Khmer government, remains the commander in this distant Red Khmer holder in Northwest Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up the government, the long-lasting loyalty is also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the sacrifice to the forum of truth and reconciliation was made possible publicly to confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Red Khmer and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and Cambodia Court of First Conviction of the former Red Khmer member, the judgment of the former leader, the notorically known violent association of Tuol Sleng, the Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, he grew up restlessness between the Red Khmer vets in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to reintroduce to the Kambodž society.
"The former Red Khmers are angry and afraid, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chang Youk, Head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life was wonderful between the Red Khmer, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides the family."
During the Government of the Red Khmer in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or starved, disease or reworked.
When the Vietnamese invaded and sentenced the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were driving guerrillas from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was cultivating supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid '90s, following a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The great group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to a government that has developed the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penhian Prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
They no longer looked after them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters have fallen into the ordinary Kambodian rural life, and many of them have nostalgically remembered the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only a minimal benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads the public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian arabic ideologies of the regime."
"They were brought up without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled himself as a poor farmer in 1998.
"The life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"The Mok has made use of everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to ensure ourselves."
The ongoing court of the Red Khmer also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate the Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of Red Khmer.
The Court of First Instance has a mandate to prosecute the head of the superintendent and the people responsible for crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in four cases.
It was just a little to calm down the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, which was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007 she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely killed.
A couple nights ago, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty trip outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared through the weeds of grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between the Red Khmers.
If the court called on her, she would refuse to go.
"In Cambodia there is peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more criminal prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed through the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought for other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"The Kamboda must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia must do for moving forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation center.
"Commitment in Khmer terms means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Government on Red Khmer, has 75 pages and the name "Historia of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides about the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only few details about the Red Khmer, despite the merger of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents skeptically responded when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are going to pursue trial."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But a public forum, a textbook, and a court of law begin to influence, and he has passed on.
Red Khmers still have a strong spell here.
Uphill in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is the road covered with weed and depleted plastic bags, which leads to an rectangle of black soots, covered with rusty metal roof.
Pol Pota's body here was burned in a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the edge of the road said she doesn't know much about a man who was cremated in that place.
"He has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea was her birthday, and she was planning to visit Pol Pota's resting place, where she will bring a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of bringing her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it seems to have its weapons based on uranium
In the surprising victory in President Obama's campaign regarding the provision of nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they will surrender their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement, issued after the Security Summit of Foreign Ministers Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to surrender to highly enriched uranium and it seemed that last spring hit the stone of accident.
But the American officials said The Washington Post that a few classified operations have been performed with Belarus in the last two months to remove the 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared land for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to the official speaking on an anonymity condition, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, where Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really impressed with the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their supplies of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear safety summit, President Alexander Lukasenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and a less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity... we don't intend to produce dirty bombs and we don't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, announced by officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1 300 miles into a Russian storage and disposal facility, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday, and it was carried out by air, said the officials.
The US government spent 13 million dollars on the program, most of it on the supply of the Belarusian research institute less enriched with uranium, which is not suitable for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
"All have been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bowiewski, official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threeat Editorship.
James Martin Center for a study on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium used for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tight for years, especially because of Lukaschenk's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual landing.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do CIA gems with years
The Spanish government has not made gems about CIA flights transporting infected Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánam through the Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by an ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is due to the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it is also written that the first deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega has requested that Spanish eclectiva be informed and "could so prove that she has proper supervision of foreign air carriers flying the Spanish airspace".
A meeting between Ambassador of the United States of America and Fernández de la Vega took place in June 2006, following the communication of the Council of Europe in which dozens of states, including Spain, were charged with violations of human rights.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the European Council's communication "was taken up by the Zamatter Government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no problem with years of secret services across its territory.
"Only they want to be informed" so that they are not "inclusive", says Aguirre in one of the documents.
Mr Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as much as possible as possible to the lowest outline, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of judges, it had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the Ambassador that, as far as it concerns him, he does not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the de-classification of documents of the National Security Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain an incriminating file or any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns more because of" the obvious coordination between the Spanish judges and German prosecutors" than because of the disclosure of CNI or the Ministry of Defence information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the United States Ambassador's lunch and the Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told this ambassador that "as long as the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will find appropriate," he gave instructions to his fellow workers, "if they avoid angry comments with the intention of reducing tension".
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - note.) on this issue.
"In spite of her general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party Party Party Popular will not hesitate to use any indications that the Zapater Government tolerated or intentionally ignored US actions which could be interpreted as possibly a violation of human rights, even if such revelation could have negative consequences for the Government of the United States", he noted.
The mother-killer complained on the network on her mother's "old"
The young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Teror in Galician."
Juanatey Bridge Fernández calls himself "Muki".
she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are Noia’s village in La Coruňa, from which the young woman originates.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know a woman’s emotional life, which the daily ABC rebuilds with the help of the testimony of her family members.
In 1998, a 35 - year - old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with an industrialist named Ivan Túnez.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his child was a newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She's found herself a new acquaintance soon enough.
Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame, was chosen.
Their existence has taken a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When a girl went to the Balerian Islands to look for a job, she stayed with her partner who even arrived for a week in Palmy.
However, from the content of its communication, it is evident that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca, and she writes, "Alberto's mad that I left for work."
"When I told him, he seemed good, but now he realizes that he must be with a small whole day and can't do what he wanted."
Then she's talking about a text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send you the baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave little with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th because I have to go to work so I don't miss the place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll marry his son.
"It will be with whom he is to be with me, and it will never happen in life that I would leave him with someone other than my mother," a doubtful intention in view of her bad relationship.
there's another contribution in July.
When he knocks out this report, the child that arrived on the island of the first day of this month is expected to be killed by the 10th.
"César is satisfied with one side, but he is not on the other side."
"He's with me on one side, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand he's going to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, and I'm going to save some money for the nanny."
Seventeen greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what video on his e-mail, look how he would like to meet with me, having sex."
30th additional message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one news about the Wiestor, the current partner, "He's giving me money."
On the internet are Moon's posts on the scars devoted to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now being revised, where she had her name "Muki ex-wives".
"Teror in Galician (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expressing his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, the mollusc entered the provincial encampment in Palma, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The attorney, Carlos Maced, said that the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened, and "that she didn't intend to hurt a little bit."
She admitted earlier, however, that she drowned Caesar in the tub and put his body in the trunk.
Even the prosecutors demand psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 chairs in the House and the PCC (Socialist party of Catalansk - said) would lose 9 mandates
with results from November 28th, PP could have the main word on the town halls in Lírida, Taragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalanian PP (The People's Party of Catalan - said), has already had the idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of those against the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catholic people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while in the withdrawals of the autonomous 2006 elections this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PCC received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PCC and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the elections were held general, the PCC could obtain 12 Members in the Chamber compared to the current 8, page CiU (Convergencia and Union, Czech Shoda and Union) would also receive 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PCC would lose at least 9 chairs (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has fundamental importance for the parties PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Working Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Levican party of Catalania) would still have lost one Member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - note.) would still have one mandate, or would have obtained one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest stage will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the rule of the Socialists in the four main provinces and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most anticipated administrations - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that the PCC could lose its town hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lírida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive the majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representative - as at least 5% of the votes must be obtained.
The PPA side increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Taragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning Taragona, where they ruled together with the PM before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PM received only 500 votes more than the PCC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign met on several occasions.
People have also gained important counsellings such as Badalon, Castelldeels or Reus.
At present, PP has a 34-room representation in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan Cell provided an Al-Qaida of thousands of passports
In addition to seven detained in Barcelona, three more were held in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerians, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a jihadistic cell controlled by Thailand, which established passports to different groups of Al-Qaida, among which were also the "Tigs of the liberation of Tamil Eelam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", with the second name of the group being the author of the arrests in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches major importance to this issue, aims to ensure that Al-Qaida is weakened by the "operation Kampai" of the counterfeiting system at international level and "restrict its operational abilities".
The investigators estimate that this cell could have been active in Catalonia over two years, sending thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaida organization, so that their "fighters" can travel safely across the borders of Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active one that had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore other European police forces in addition to Thai services were involved, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will not be similar interventions in other European countries, such as last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another one in Thailand in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirianlay Kijbumrung were captured.
They were just these men who drove a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
Catalan network, part of which has been disposed of in 2009, especially tourism passports which met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to be based on men aged between 25 and 45, they had to have been in force for several years and be without marked visas.
In the investigation documents, it is stressed that no facts are yet known to be attached to the detention of Catalan with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that several days before this attack, it was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency of about a thousand dollars that were "scheduled" to buy cards in mobile phones, which later were used by members of the "comanda" who killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People’s Party (PP) requires Maso to cease the fiscal agreement
The president of the PCC (The People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezová-Camach had the opportunity yesterday to present himself to Arthur Mas on his terms, under which he was willing to support his display in the function of President Generalitate; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the abolition of risky businesses such as the economic agreement which the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's People's Republic has come to a meeting with Arthur Mas with a certainty of 18 Members' chairs received in the elections from last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining the obliage, so the applicant needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to abstain from voting on his entry into office.
The possible compliance with PP depends on the future alliance that nationalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far the talks leading to Mas with the rest of political leaders are held in the Catalan spirit.
As regards President PP, in order to get her support for putting into office, "it will have to end with all the sovereign and free speech", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the Basque leader CiU - whom he even wanted to vote on in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to suffocate the over-the-counter political apparatus of autonomous governance and reduce inheritance tax and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Massov's entry to the function will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mass has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC) who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The head of the geriatric facility shall ensure that the death has not been caused by the "irresistance of the measure"
Olot center formations do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 clients
The head of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to detect the damage caused by the institution of the criminal behavior of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caretaker who, in the meantime, was employed here, killed by at least 11 seniors in his care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala was accompanied by a law firm lawyer, lawyer Joan Canad, and announced that "the wish of home of La Caritat would be able to press charges against the guilty" responsible for killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because, in time, it has not discovered the criminal activities of the care provider, the great threat to La Caritat's home now represent the requirements for material compensation which are already calculated by legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Villa Dilmé admitted that his first crime had occurred in August 2009 and that since then he had stopped killing
The judge ordered an exhumation of eight bodies of home for seniors to suspect that in many cases no physician looked at the deceased personally, but that - given the age and poor health of patients - everything was done on the phone.
La Caritat, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any case be the cause of what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that, apart from the person accused, any third party would be in doubt".
A man named "The Angel of Death" admitted to death yesterday 11 and explained that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and killed by a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case in which a mixture of calming tablets was used.
Director La Caritat added that it is complicated to control the access of personnel to medicine.
Insulin and cocktail seditatives were likely in six cases from nine cases used by this care provider to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analysis that is now being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Villa was lying and was really looking for a less cruel death for his first victims, or, on the contrary, he killed them by giving a bow, as he admitted to three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in health claims and do not rule out that the number of killed people may be higher than they have admitted, and justify their behavior in different versions given by Villa court knowing that they have to change their actions when it turned out that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available for justice to be illuminated by the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is under threat
Last night, investors responded to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who pointed out that "the fairs should not underestimate our ability to react".
The national differentials closed by force and the shares of the European Bank decreased by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just increased beyond critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-exclusive market, which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take the liquidity back today, and tomorrow will have to call back the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of State debt for the inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity rates within a time limit and leaving unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rates to be "minimum to March" and to receive a three-month bid with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even notify it.
If this does not fulfil the expectations created, it will restore the market response from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw liquidity rates, God will with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow could be repeated history.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, she announced the armored fist on Monday, and on Wednesday she said that she had already purchased many of them, leading to further collapse of the market.
Last night's exchange licence for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro released only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous auctions.
Thus, the rates in Portugal dropped by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the mood of the market followed by Trichet.
The figures published in Ireland represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, until February they have the chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem has not revealed stress tests in July, the amounts under the auxiliary plan are acceptable and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need the approval of the new budget by the Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so that Ireland continues to hold uncertainty.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to release tensions in the face for the next EU top meeting held on 14 December, on which a political compromise must be reached, which would show that we are a union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is, Germany wants to play Wagner while the others would rather be the Beethoven Ode for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan for a measure to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to restore employment - this sounds like a four-year period since Viviani.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish storm grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice the remaining European storms.
Unlike February, the government and the Spanish National Bank’s response was quick and convincing - we are hardly surprised by the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key loan for three years, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be a great demand for it, which will help to distract doubts about our ability to refinance.
Requesting a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - at a high rate and the market access would be closed to us by sin die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Cesar's strategy - "not only to be this, but also to seem".
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group will consider the meetings of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not make it easy.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack him after he has taken him for "a considerable deal", El Enebro's legal action scheduled for 16th of this month, and five of his seven offspring required, to try to force his majority and to take the advantage of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's administrative agencies.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesús David and María José, are in possession of a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of the company.
The founder of the largest holding company service does not seem willing to comment in his dispute on membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven offspring were established from its Administrative Committee, who were appointed leaders during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of that year, whose objections are entered in the Commercial Register.
El Enebro's trial for the 16th of this month, which was called by the Commercial Court no. 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunderstorm in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means to guarantee the appeal of the committee.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez's Mezquirizes consider David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of a court of law and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and strengthen the negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis to justify the legal assault of this act as "almost irrelevant".
The protagonists, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to convene the court in June.
In El Enebro, a group with other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvareze's 100% capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue which the judge will have to decide in the trial of the court's appeal, and the date of this trial has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull fell into Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the rising tendency of recent times, everyone was betting on Ferrari Fernanda Alons' triumphs.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine, which drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 was born a legend - the secret weapon, which the multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is an executive software that simulating the marches that the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purpose of very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high accuracy equipment.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditures.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software has enabled Red Bull to perform "in the course of a few hours, in almost real time" modification and improvement, which is otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed stables on average 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements over a period of one period.
at the Red Bull team today he is working on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
Siemens explained that PLM was able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull racing vehicle, except for the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit in this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has established a high-tech race in London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings to which access is limited - especially to journalists.
All that happens here is considered "great secret."
The list of participants is 580 people, including two pilots - Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is in Formula 1 without doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Other protagonists, whose assistance is priceless, but no one knows them, are hiding behind the irresistible technological means that the brand of energy drinks has placed into their participation in racing circles.
The Chief of Production Technology, Steve Nevey, claims five years ago, it was possible to say that progress in research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the support of riders.
at present this ratio has changed and technology is worth achieving 85% while pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, since they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will establish 20 own stores in cooperation with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of the Spanish HP Helena Herrer mentioned as an example of a newly rebuilt shop in Barcelona, Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The Severo-American Society has adopted a plan to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Srbsko), so the trade in Barcelona is third.
Herrer didn't want to tell where other shops would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid might be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also manages HP personnel systems, assured that philosophy of opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactably tested) which will be identical in Europe.
Moreover, HP also deals with the provision of staff for business.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be a franchising, and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, serving, after-sale service and even packaging".
The trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot vertical programme at the world level, which aims to address any problems with computer equipment in a guarantee.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht.
"So we can solve problems in 10 minutes that can take up to two days otherwise."
"This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service", said Helena Herr yesterday.
Sabadell's betting he'll steal over three years his competitors millions of clients.
Optimist than other bosses, seconded member of Bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be demanding for the bank, but rejecting a new liquidity crisis and predicting the end of passive war.
Nevertheless, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will try to compensate for the discount of bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get millions of private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and thus to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategy plan in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival, without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by subsidising a million new private clients - plus 700,000, if any, those who leave the bank - because up to now, and the Institute rather moved small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% in the company's customer.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it can also be said soberness, with a view to reducing the costs that the bank will call for when it presents results over the period.
At this time, the small banking institutions are determined to set their targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all world banking plans.
Sabadell will close his Optim program this year, set four years ago, although originally it was three years old, but the market situation required extension for the next period.
Customers who leave savings will be their main target group.
At the meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "hard and very important".
Indeed, the way from the crisis in Spain is "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years, "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that a passive war - which reduces the margins - falls off, the price of the premium for the risk that banks and the savings pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already moving to the prices of loans, which compensates for the reduction of the margin.
"This liquidity and financing is structural and will represent the pressure factor for loans".
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardian.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognised that the trend in banking "now is the reduction of commissions", but here is the "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of the Sabadell bank is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
He does not make sure that in Spain "they will demand greater size".
"The next year will not remain on a stone," he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are "reducingly" and do not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
It also points out that FROB can generate funds in the market before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue but, unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained by means of a recession, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes further wave of sporelene fusion
The CEO of CECA refused yesterday that further wave of sporadic fusion should be created and again insisted on the speed with which to reorganise the sector.
When he started the process of association of Spanish savings, there were several institutions that ensured that this first stage would not participate and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederen (CECA) José Antonio Olavrriet voted out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening is conventions".
"Most of it is completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish national bank, which has worked very well on this matter", the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (The Association of Leaders and Executive Officers of Aragagon, he said:) Olavrrieta has recommended that the process of concentration takes place at "the highest possible speed and we must be very pleased as it turns out in instalments that have appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank, not now, in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", stressed.
"Go from 45 savings with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that they are larger and thus, in line with the Basel Treaty, they undercut.
Olavrieta recognised that "there are a number of unfamiliar views on the slowness of the process" which show "the lack of serrity and understanding" because "what the Spanish national bank does is to remind that we must be in the term before the end of the year".
CEO CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and for those who question it, he has admitted "a lack of knowledge".
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" in terms of financial institutions and savings as well as a system that managed the "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very well based on stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin decided to keep the euro but established the conditions for the whole of the Union.
The tension in the markets has provoked a dual government response.
On one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through regulation of private intermediary agencies or cancellation of 426 euro for unemployed without benefits, to privatisation 49% of AENA (Spain Airport and Air Traffic Management) by the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, joined critics on the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to launch the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
In advance, Merkel's view is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of the euro redeficiary.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future is supposed to be, which reflects the idea of respecting the old traditions that are kept by a large proportion of other members.
Faced with European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways from the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, part of which would be Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to the march - although it can now be like a scifi, this version has broad public support, which is close to 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for the re-work of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary flexibility, fines for the guilty countries, possible deferrals of payments to some of them, and with the extension of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for some time, so there is no space for the dials now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged the deficits in 2009, the German Constitutional Reform Government pulled out of hand to prevent them from coming.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the fiscal strictities and stability plans for public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second one showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully involved decisions regarding the rescue of Greece.
It was already the subject of a sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, was strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in recent October, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she required to reform the European Union's conventions so as to allow for the salvation of a Member State, while having the privacy of creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat reduced form, has been approved, and in the next few months we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has set out a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And everyone is telling us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that they seem to disagree with, from this date, the euro will end with the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone in which countries breaking the rules will be seriously fined and may be forced to report the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests that we need to give ourselves a strict growth path with an increase in savings and investments, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments ruled by Spain’s growth boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not only about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be wrong.
I hope these current turbines are more calm.
And to take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two declarations (reforms promised after meeting with the large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) are aware that through criticism to Merkel's address, the way of thinking is to put things right.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the options to be considered, there is no way for the euro area to be left full of non-serious countries to be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that he warned us.
Sport and circumvention
The Finlands that Alonso and Ramos have shown in a fight with Ajax not the intention of escapeing the punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergio Ramose) in the League of Champions against Ajax on 23 November caused the sea to drink out of ink about whether this is or is not non-portive behavior and whether the football players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is known, several minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) appointed players one by another deliberately lost their time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the drought, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed sentence in the following match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end up in its group in the lead - and will be able, removed cards, continue to follow up the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission granted a penalty to Coach José Mourinho for two matches and the guilty players received a cash fine.
The provocation of yellow cards under similar conditions is no new practice but is more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos football, i.e. the rules that are unscrupulous, but they're following.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that Real Madrid (who in his anthem boasts nobleness and honor and who has already repented for similar acts of his players), and as it seems, thanks to the dramaticization conducted by Mourinhem, which adds to his long history a comedian and provocative another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether the circumvention is taking place in these sketches; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, whose meaning it appears to be to be circumventing.
It deals with what kind of damage such activities are caused by a sports spirit.
One of the elements of sports behavior is the physical intrusiveness of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent game.
Another of these features characterized by a clean game is avoiding that players have an advantage against their opponent team - which is also not the case here.
Thus, the paradox in the action of Reala Madrid players is that it was not what we normally characterise as a lest or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour was to be as evident as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited, and they'd love to get away with it.
Another question, however, is what will be the advantage of the guilty from their intentional offense.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match there is no benefit because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next match, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage is, apparently, that players will begin the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in the next match.
However, this is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. the team can be eliminated at first glance, and in addition to this, players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which exclusion is sufficient by one card less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it won't be completely clear whether this is an advantage.
As a matter of fact, these negotiations do not go against the sport spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions, which will enable maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
in the case that we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid being punished (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather choose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the border between the institution and the circumvention of the rules is not very clear, I believe that in this case clearly it was a weakness.
It seems to me that the polemice arises for two reasons: for it was two self-department and because of the way in which the instructions for their discharge from the leadership were passed.
The damage to sports principles to these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight offers about having Christmas parties in Barcelona
The catalogue of the calendar concentrates the avalanche of reservations this year on 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations of the employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros quickly comes in.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, the arrival of December comes again for pre-war parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for leisure in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have led to the fight for clients getting a price reduction: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, attracting entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the complications of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) applications for a week from 13 December, resulting in avalanche of reservations for days in the top (16th and 17th), while during the previous week there was almost no operation.
As this has been happening since 2008, when the skinny years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave tradition, many employees pay to spend their time at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the level of kidnapping, says the President of the restaurant association Gremi de Restaurantó de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At this point, the representative of the restaurant facility is not going to predict what will be the celebrations of this month.
"People will think about it well before they make reservations."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful," he adds.
Trades go well to those who offer quality and good service at a favorable price, says and recalls that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down and most of the customer wants to spend about 25 euros now.
The research in different facilities shows that the biggest aid for booking requests is December 17th.
Soteras is reporting a real boom reservation for this Friday, with the most demands being spent up to €30, which have adapted the menu offered to which the total prices are between €25 and €30.
In another important company, which is Andilana, which has numbered 16 facilities in the city (Hosal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), it has brought the speciality of this calendar of more early reservation since the beginning of November.
"We made possible even impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should choose, move from 19.95 to 30 euros", indicate.
In the AN Group group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen profit increases since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that the 18th December will be a busy day, as it will be the pre-war celebrations between friends.
to their six group menu added a Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a trend of 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spasian shaming wine) compared to last year.
They also noted that companies already appear, which call their employees again, and the size of the groups seems to be much larger.
The Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Centres of Free Time in Barcelona) Enrico Goma believes he's starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations are "living", although the clients "receive at maximum".
Even during the Christmas celebrations, this impression did not disappear, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear programme has become a great calmer in the United States
The Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassy in Pakistan and the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that raises the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to clarifying and significant details which offer about the content of communication and the ideas of representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islam, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states as regards nuclear security instead of increasing, "is at retreat" and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The splendor of Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after parts to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before visiting the national security advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear devices to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenals and the programme of controlled missiles is no longer seen only by the USA, but also by Russia as a growing reason to be alert.
"The Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the drop in levels of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes managed missiles", said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The biggest new documentation published by Julian Assange's server is increasingly the lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Depese issued by the embassy in May which qualifys for communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unrequited or rejected".
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence worker for South Asia, notes that "and despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to end up with the silent support of terrorist groups during his visit to General Ashfaq Kayani's army.
He's going to be at the Wikileaks' boss.
Obama appoints a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red call" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth, where it's hard to be certain facts.
Interpol announced a "minimum call" yesterday, called red note, for "location and monitoring of movement" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And he has more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents to do with the last leak, but he has no sexual abuse charges Australan is facing in Sweden.
Besides that, he's providing an attorney with Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20, when the International Police Department, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when he received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, the 188 countries have Interpol's instructions for identifying or localisation of Assange "in order to make a temporary link to it and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of the person concerned with the red call, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, consider the so-called red notice for allowing arrest - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially if the States have a bilateral agreement on the issue of detained persons, such as Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be found.
This step worsened Assenge’s lawyers, who published the writing yesterday, where they claim that the nine - year - old Founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities through videoconference.
They also recalled that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which compares with the legendary Lavrentije of Pavlovič Berijo, Chief of Stalin Security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange is no longer in the unknown place, but does not silence.
On Monday, Skype provided an interview with the director of Time magazine from an unknown point of view - in this interview, the demission of the Foreign Secretary of the United States Hillary Clinton required.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to carry out spying at the United Nations and to violate the international conventions signed by the United States, it should resign", he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demise as "serious and absurd".
"I am not quite sure why we should care about the individual that runs the website", said he for CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's direction to stop adding Assang to his importance contrasts with the views that have been shown by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will, from January, be Chairman of the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber, has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including the Wikileaks between the terrorist organisations, "to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who will financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed", which he had to call off.
"The Obama should write on him a reward or use a planeless or something like that."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever will be in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking information has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild", said Fox Station.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC on Carda
The Republican leader will allow the secret party to vote on his persuasion.
Huguet proposes more plural eclectivism and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós has obviously found a recipe to fight with a number of internal revolutions in the ERC series (Levic Republic Party of Catalan - said), with no result due to the loss of 11 Members and half votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding the demise seems to be the supporters of the former Josepa Lluís Cardo-Rovira's former leader, and he also knows that the impact of this sector today is as weak as its leader, and that he is absolutely unable to do the kind of worry he had with other missing currents.
That's why the leader Left will try to get new criticisms through the murmur that will help him defend himself in the municipal elections.
First of all, Puigcerós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to secretly refer to its continuation in office.
With voting tickets, not by raising your hand.
If the supporters of Carod want to give the President a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of the action being taken.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the decomposition and subject himself.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result of "after Bulgaria".
Following the chairman, Carod's followers require more than their function - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight since Puigcercós controls at the conventions of the largest organ.
But since they do not have enough to force the demise, they will try to make an excellent reminder of the plan from now to May.
This is why they expect to participate in the drawing up of a document on strategic reorientation, which will give the management the national council on 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcerós in exchange for this promise to move Congress in autumn 2011.
Mr ERC declared that "multimodity" would damage stability, and that his goal was to make the organization able to wash their dirty laundry at a closed door once and for all.
In this context, it appears to be a significant article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After he took into consideration Puigcercós' ideologist, he took this innovation counselor for the finished thing that the leader would be confirmed "exchange for several purposes".
And he named five of them, two of whom exist.
The first is "recomposing" eclectively to represent at least 90% of members, which also means to include new faces that are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second goal can be a big new one.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely terminate its meetings as a mechanism of functioning.
Thus, he is fighting for reforming the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by votes.
The completion of the meeting system model, the exception in the Spanish political system, is the intended objective of the Puigcerós team, which in this respect has already fought at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 Christian assembly decided that the meeting had to be assessed at a special convention on reforms.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation inside the party has been discouraged from solving this matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it could be a good time to renegotiate this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for November 2010; 390 for 2010
According to MILLENIO, Mexico decreased by 4 cases compared to 2010.

Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their head covered with tape were found in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
With the victim, the report was probably written by one of the crime organizations where it was like, "This will happen to those who will not adapt."
In Ecatepec two bodies were found, which carried signs of torture and had bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month were found remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Náhualcoyoyotl.
The first of them was cut off and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and kept a message with him; while the other was tortured and found in a plastic cover in the streets of Colonia Juarez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the news.
China is respecting its goal to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that its country had developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints and specified that it was insisting on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, a representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Su Wei assured that his country has developed enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the last four years.
However, he explained that China would not change its targets and continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He recommended that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into the following four elements: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
All these points have already made progress, including last year's approval of the new energy law, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
Furthermore, it stressed that in China federal authorities co-operated with the authorities of provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, they are in progress or have already been completed by various multiannual plans, which are financed by both the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
This is, for example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, introduced over the last five years, and received investments from the UN, Government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, as well as a project for the exchange of light bulbs for cost-efficient bulbs and a reduction and adaptation project.
At the same table Martin Krol assured, an expert adviser to this country for climate change, that China’s efforts were greater than in general thinking.
For example, he did, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share in emissions.
In the same way, the unprecedented efforts have been made in terms of energy use - for example, increased by 20% in energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress by 2020.
Exclusion of Espin: César Nava
National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) said that the former President of this Party is entitled to request his right at the National Order Board.
The National Chairman of the PAN Party, César Nav Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was ordered and that the former chairman of this Party is entitled to contact the National Order Committee and to claim his rights.
in an interview that was taken before the opposition of the Governor of the State of Gabon Cué Montegud, he said that the exclusion of Espin is, in any case, a decision taken at local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address in his case through a complaint to the Board of Directors of the National Council in order to act on decisions made by the competent authority," he added.
In addition, he explained that now there is no time to think about 2012, and that it was never at the negotiating table on the presidature of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN will come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December in which his followers will be elected.
"This (aliance in 2012) is a topic which was never at the negotiating table, at least not for yet, it was an intention for a local election which was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he doubled.
President PAN said that it was 71 years of dialogue behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, but we complain and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the committee could choose the best president or president, who deserves to be elected for the next three years, so he will pass on the "whom the committee will determine".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, therefore, to any of those five with pride, I will pass the office of the President of the Party."
He foretold that the rise the party had recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future convents, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now we need to escort Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that these three governments, having roots in the Oaxation, Pueble and Sinaloe, would represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, because "they are put into them many expectations and desires, and I am sure that Gabino will keep these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Caldeczna side PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institute, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, said) because of his speeches within the four years that he ruled, César Nava invited PRI members to think about six years of former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If they believe that Zedilla and Salinase's governments were better than Fox and Cladek's reign, then they'd start defending them to come out of their country," he said.
He said that the chief of federal power has the right to express itself as he did during his speech in the National Auditory, because in this country he does not use gag or censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter law to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and hope that this law should be approved," the US president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama has today contributed to his personal account on Twitter social networks to national mobilisation in support of Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and insist that this law be approved," tweet Obama.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators without delay, as voting on this law is approaching.
"If the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the moment to let your opinion sound," she points.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block approval of any law unless an extension of the tax reduction from Bush's era and government funding has been approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of Dream Act and other proposals, the president expressed his belief that once the fiscal theme was resolved, he would be able to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still enough time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we can plan the order of other matters", he said.
The Leader of the Democratic majority of the Chamber Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he will request a vote on the conclusion of the debate on Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalization of students without documents could vote in the Senate from next Thursday, although he is more likely next week.
Senatorial approvals of Dream Act or the "American Dream" law would legalise some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before they were 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years and were admitted to an institution of higher education or to an army.
However, the supporters need 60 votes for approval, so that they need some Republicans to help, so that the organization of his supporters is doing an intense agitated to ensure that this law is approved.
Democrats, most of whom Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed his view that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
That is why Dream Act supporters need to obtain several Republicans in the event that other Democrats decide to refuse.
Senators from Maine Olympia Snowová and Susan Colins are among the Republican senators with whom they are most negotiating, as well as the moving senator from Florida George Lemieux, who has completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have said that they will no longer support it.
Another Republican who has supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself at this moment.
Although the House of Representatives is inclined to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature insertes fingers in the wound ("pomer el dedo en la llaga", translated "toe in the wound" is the similar of the Czech "cut the nail on the head - note.)
The second round of the series Rejoice from the language was a promenade, where participants presented the literary gala performances
"This is what I understand with Sex in the language, but what's waiting for me?", said writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Rejoice from the tongue, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subject (on another trade fair dedicated to Sex in language at the round table, explained).
The first in the morning "has brought us to the narrows", was a finely Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, the modified Marisol Schultz and the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Maya Monterová and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave to Gonzalu Celori, and which Schultz later described as a great story in which Luisa was the first person to perform as a protagonicist who, in searching for the knowledge of what he was like, goes from a doctor to a doctor who does not respond to her, although there is a trace of the same story.
From an infectologist, the convinced, "the patience isn't my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustration with a trauma scientist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the morning is really a open and symbolic is a scar".
The protagonist has lightened up and concluded that "she was able to learn only so much that she is truly in a position and that she does not exist", but has gained the belief that the pleasure and strife in the language must go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nikaragujec Sergio Ramírez also came up with a lovely story called the Praise of the Invention, in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but appears at one point.
With the elements of magic realism, she tells of the famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who went far away, or repaired the virtues that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which since the beginning his own stepmothers, who had spoken it, and the quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which criticises the extermination in the narrative of the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (sendurants) was mocked by a false testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such a picturefulness that lacked even shameful well."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have greater fantasy" and precisely where the reality and lies are lost, where they no longer know what is in the story belongs to one group and the other, achieves fictional literature of their peak.
This is indeed called "cervantian tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Finally, Maya Monter highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations invited by the International Book Fair with her Besedou Prst into the wound enabled.
The Cuban-portorist writer showed her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the consequence of commercial disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs are closing a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended", said she after saying that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of compromise that creates between authors and readers - and in their "chemical response".
In the evening he closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also stressed "on this finger in the wound the writer involved by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits, and in control of consciousness that quenchs dogmatism, it is forgotten that "that behind every attraction there is a small non-no, and behind every denial is also a small yes".
"To be the masters of our ideas and reality we must color: and to color it means to put a finger in the wound many times and to trouble those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, black and white, and without colouring, and also to burden the authority that prefer this black and white world," he said to support the purpose of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubin Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finals, experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already been able to achieve three occasions on the decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, two different styles of their techniques, which appear to be different between them in the results.
Rubin Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finals, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve at three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with the unresolved, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
Argentina had to settle with the silver medal, stay step by step for the winner and competed with the same team as the next final.
As a coach, Santist strateg got to his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had held the Morelia club’s weight, which according to a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then, again, in the Clausura 2003 tournament, he went to a decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna's tournament in Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the Devils of Toluky, Ruben re-emerged defeat, although his team played against "Uzenářs" (the other nickname of Deportivo Toluca's Deportivo club - note.) after 210 minutes of the game inconveniently 2-2, after a series of criminal shooting he got to benefit three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players passed from 11 steps and thus lost his turn to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against "Black Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, which is why he would like to avoid the same fate and to get rid of the curse, and so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important one", said the coach when he was asked about numbers that speak in the final against him.
in live memory, the previous final, in which, as confirmed, we learned a lot, "we have learned a lesson that until the referee has no end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalts, we have already been prepared to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the game is over, we cannot celebrate."
He doesn't worry that this series could decide in criminal fires, he believes in his players: "You never try to reach a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal times, but sometimes there's no alternative, and we need to be ready for it, and in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately, our fate caught a bad move for us, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, that something left us and hopefully that this time would not happen."
Romano has a chance to stop being the other one and to taste the glory they bring titles for the first time.
The United States amends the rules on visa sharing
People will have to turn to the Center of the Ministry for Visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and the waiting period will be shorter.
From 10 January 2011, the visa process at the United States Embassy and consultations will change.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Services Centre for visa applicants (in short of the English ASC) before the interview at the Consulary Department.
Staff from ASC will receive biometric information from the applicant and they will be evaluated before the interview by the Consular Department.
The new procedure will have certain advantages between the following:
The total costs for the settlement of visas will be lower, no longer need to pay for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $ 140 per tourist visa, $150 for cases of visa with applications (including visa for temporary agents) and $390 per visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with a consular official, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and have their fingerprints taken away.
Since biometric information will be received in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
In the same way, those who will apply for a visa to the consultations in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of 26 dollars.

NASA announces the discovery of an alien life
The US Space Agency has called on a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, astobiological discovery, which could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 hours by experts on asthmaology, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA made sure that she would introduce "a sign that causes break in the search for extraterrestrial life", which stimulated speculation of experts from other countries.
It could confirm the theory that there are also other creatures living in in inconspicuous conditions, which were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that one day they would become intelligent creatures such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
According to this, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, because the lake is rich in the arena.
In some way, he uses arsenic to his life, and this is his ability to increase the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to asthmaologists, if these organisms are using arsenic metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will notify the actual range of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will take part in the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the biggest month of Saturn) with a perspective that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", declares.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet started when a opposition block was formed in Congress, led by MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolutionion Democratica, Czech "Democracy Party", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Working Party" - note: "Convergencia" (Czech "Shoda") and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvem, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to Sněmovny.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "swieve" against the reform of the Constitutional Act, since it excludes them.
This reform, repeated, begins with "bapartism" because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by El Salvador López Brit from the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - noted.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginalist from the impulse of the parties to PRI (Partido Revolutiononario Instituteal, Czech "The Revolutionary Institution Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the following days they will speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will be subject again to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I come here (the opposition coalition), I look at it because we are cut out of any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergence said that they were a match with the PRD, PT and Patron, and that is why they will form a plural group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, was now "duopal".
The inspiration of law reform is not to be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and their members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to gain more votes as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT explained that at the moment Congress has become the "circle" of two - in the conversion to the web page PAN and PRI.
"There was only one side of it that day divides it two."
Patrón Montalvo asked that there be respect for the personality of the Member to be given a seat at the table.
"To be five Members who are likely to be nine, but now they see us at five, they will not be left because of an off-limited agreement, each in another fraction, we have united ourselves to find a place at the table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Is another 200,000 pesos for "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay for another check discussed by the company owner supplying the electronics.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The sum paid in this second half of the company owner supplying the electromaterial will rise to 1.20.000 pesos.
According to the website of the transparency of the town hall, this last check was sent on November 16th of that year, it was exposed to 200.144,56 pesos and as his subject was referred to "the settlement of outstanding payments".
The owner of Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was followed by the National Review Office for sale at high prices, another claim.
What has not been said is the total amount of money she still owes to the town hall, and how many more checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought now, but it only pays what we owed to her, just like the other suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The last checks "news appeared" last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, 19 October, 29 October, and this last November 16th.
Although this businessman has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as stated by the law in the case of companies audited by the General Audit Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasury has assured that she has not again used the services of the City Hall's contractor.
during the preceding 25 July, he published Noroeste's daily revision of checks issued by the councillors to its suppliers, which revealed that during the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of mayor Jorge Abela Lópeze Sánchez, the town of Camach Palazuelos paid over 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumaada, where it included checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Besiddle Sánchez Taboad in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of foreign tourists into the resort of Sánchez Taboad, the tourist sector in Mazatlán requests the authorities to pay attention to areas and places which are in bad condition and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Trademen of the Zone Council, recalled that they repeatedly asked to care for the impression of destination, and the bad that tourists find here to replace it with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and pavement is affecting tourists who are walking around and seeing messes, which negatively affects close businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to close for one day a business, and they don't have any idea of the sales they're missing, otherwise they won't deal with these things for so long without proper planning."
Hotelér José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and to prevent this to happen again, it will have to take care of preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing faults," he commented.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area should be maintenance, for even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its city maintenance strategy".
There are other places that look neglected and poor, noted, such as Mazatlánský Emblem and El Venadito (moment, statue of deer - noted.).
"In today's time for tourists to come, it does not matter only for promotions, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city that is polluting the purity of its beaches and streets where a permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out", he said.
"There was no need for attention, and these facts stress something that is well known to all, maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be arranged in cooperation with the councillors, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and safe to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-toucher of Tourist Promotions, said that saving tourist locations in Mazatlán is impeccable because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, but it will need to be arranged in order to make these places attractive and we can put them in a list that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for Congress results
Eduardo Dałalos, President of CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by following an example in finding better Sinaloy, in various challenges to face.
The parliamentary period of full decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is being thrown off in convulsions and face major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 of the PAN, three of the Parties of Nueva Alanza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments towards society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that there will be no repeating the same party and paternalists.
Eduardo Dałos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take great responsibility and lead to an example on the way for a better Sinaloou in the various challenges facing.
"We expect the Members to exercise their rights, without agreements between the Parties, because they usually take steps to promote their own interests and become criminal parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary cape that would shift the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and to be primarily committed to societies and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloy who gave them their vote in past elections of trust."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Association of Tres Islas hotels, expressed that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would gather all the forces in order to achieve the economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support jobs in a certain way".
As regards tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him a greater weight in the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that this is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which in addition directly competes with agriculture."
In addition to issuing funds for start-up tourist projects, Congress should help deliver the state in certainty and help with the law on alcohol that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
The dolls, the cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the children's wish list in the Coronade Valenzuel family.
For their parents, three kings will be hard to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival, since their household is exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaid, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaacs, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will make toys and clothes that they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time, because the husband is not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm going out this afternoon with "plebes" on the street to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaid wishes a doll or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie's doll.
As for José Alfred's ten-year-old, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús would have wanted Cayetana's clothes in size for one year.
"I told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see son' because it was very expensive', he remembers the sad Cayeten.
For older children who were in school, it would be ideal for clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, which is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaac size 10, whereas Miguel wears a size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing his sneakers, so he could use a couple of five-and-a-half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Three Kings" and at the front desk of Noroeste bring a gift or cash in cash.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
The visit was carried out in Estonia, Wednesday, during the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that used to produce drugs.
"A total of 750 deaths of Indian cannabis, four pounds of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce was confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of Quebek.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, both of which are supposed to be bosses all over this network, two men from Sherbrook.
The persons who were arrested had to come to the judicial palace in Sherbrook afterwards after their arrest.
They could face charges from the Indian cannabis production, holding it with the aim of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were subsequently carried out following a long-term investigation that took almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public and which allowed us to proceed to these arrests", said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers in the City of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the State Police Department in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbroook Memphrémag.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The proposal of the Conservative Act, which according to the Government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said that they could not support it.
"I'm leaning on the Chart."
"By the way, on the side of the party that built the gall under your feet," said the chief of liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a week's session du caususus.
The liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would be able to retain up to one year any person coming from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The chief of thequebeck Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because it is heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all the opposition parties are opposed, so see what the government will do," said M. Ducep.
The critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms who want her party not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"The non-democratics agree to take measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be a carrier part of another bill, C-35", said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the Conservatives' Act because it rules on refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs. Chow.
The Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are massively telling the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canada takes on the fly and treat it as some kind of patolial."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, responding to Minister Kenneth.
The government has not declared the vote on trust in its bill of law, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote for every member who is opposed to his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement, it is possible to set up a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption, many observers still require the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives that this thought does not fall in oblivion: Québec intends to discuss this issue with the Department of Investment of New York in January next year.
Metropole has a permanent anticorruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that during the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even if Robert Dutil himself was also present.
More was not needed to make public security critics, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, valued this announcement as a "creed made out of the hat" and "amatéric solutions blown on the knees".
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He's satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjeana Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of hearing witnesses in a public trial.
"Mr. Charest is in agreement with the fact that he doesn't want to create this investigation committee, and people think, just like you and I, he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of an investigation commission is Jean Charesta's demise", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Governments.
In order to be able to come out of this dead end, he proposed Quebec to grant special authority to the general inspector in order to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector," he decided.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner that allows people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government files.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code, so that it is better suited for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the agent responsible for the operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law of this type of investigation is not exploding.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments linked to this file.
During the Jaro 2001 operation, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been modified, 131 people were arrested.
The Ottawa subsequently made changes to the law on gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to heavy precipitations which have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of province.
There was a land fall in the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan in Maurice.
Two houses have been evacuated prevently.
In the evening there was another land fall in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's affluent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit a strong downfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 further millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit most.
There could be a total of up to 100 millimetres falling.
If we add up to these snowfalls collected in certain sectors, we may be concerned with floods in some water flows.
Quebek's rescue service announced on Wednesday evening a warning against the dangers of the flood for the river Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lobinière, became the subject of flood emergency and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, some lakes, Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as Rawdon, caused a strong reduction in the distribution of some lakes.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was removed as a result of heavy rains.
Two residents had to be evacuated prevently.
In Outaouais extracting some lakes from the shores caused the closure of certain roads, especially in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency service has an emergency and oversees the situation in this area, says Annik Bouchard, security consultant.
The Quebic Center for Forecasts of the floods issued a warning on Wednesdays against strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially paled
The Quebecký Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements relating to social assistance and Haitian and, as well as because of gross speech during the broadcast.
The radio and television broadcast Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHHI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "unexcessful information on social assistance and unfamiliar negative conduct of the Haitians of gross expression which did not correspond to the broadcast broadcast issued during the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took life, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and TV Council received several complaints regarding the comments made during the transmission, transmitted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the transmission were inconclusive.
The moderators must submit reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission's members concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide cannot be understood as solving the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the contested episodes of the broadcast "Dupont pole messages" have hit a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate way."
No excuse has been raised against him.
The last dispute involved a statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort therefore went into a media shootout that caused a lot of reactions.
Mr Choi said he didn't send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't be sure that the need for money will actually get.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unauthorized but that their cumulative effect creates an unbelievably negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already removed my three-day delay of this thing."
"My file has not been affected for one and a half years", said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross speeches.
In any case, the radio broadcast of CHOI-FM cooperated "over their duties".
For stations that will have to notify, inter alia, these decisions once during the main transmission within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of du kung fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special course.
Atlet, which stands out in "sand" (ung-fu "full connect"), in kickbox and Thai box enters the dads and ringes of the whole world and searches for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital city since 2008, to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for a bit of a game everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, the competition in North America is rare."
Recently, this person who works as a security guard and has just added bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox category full connect and the Thai box," he said.
"Now I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou for China."
"They were invited by opponents who ended up with the first four in the final world championship in every category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, I ended up in Vietnam eighth."
"In 2007 in China I ended up in the fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto I finished third, added."
"The interesting thing is, I've made some progress in every competition."
"This is the tempt I'm going to be the first year or even the night!"
"shan shu" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where punches of fists and legs, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
The matches have traditionally been played on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of struggle, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Narcer Zemmal is supposed to keep one result in his career, he will confirm his participation in the superturnaji "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in Kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the sympathic guy."
"He's kind of a equivalent to the Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in semi-finals his category (80 kg) before he suffered loss in the final.
"He that defeated me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Team semi-finals will meet in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will meet to be crowned the only champion, king of kung fu."
450 Unclosured Millions
Hydro-Québec agreed with a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineing for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important contract, a project management contract of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was able in 2004 to choose Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this important hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" was awarded a lucrative contract without any public competition.
For the Quebec party, a complaint about the consortium of enterprises before us is faced with a serious ethical problem which risks the exclusion of competition and creates an increase in prices.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition."
"That means that people, side agreements no longer do them secretly, today they do them openly," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at the press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says that it is difficult to carry how public interest can be sold like this.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said this afternoon, in any event denying that it would be a collusion contract.
"I've got my own way," she rallied and claimed that the PQ was "incredible" and "less" accuracy.
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or more companies to group their mutual expertise in order to respond to an invitation to submit offers to a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very difficult to take into account the vastness of work.
The construction is already running and has to be broken down by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of the consortium is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the consortium in the field of consulting in engineing is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we move at the speed of thequebec business register, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, while some seem to be permanently created.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; named CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, leads to one and the same legal person, and this is Dessau.
As regards the consortium of the Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the merger of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of labor and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that would make us throw up the forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded in mutual agreement.
"If you're going to the public competition and if there's not enough participants in the bid, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you collect people who are in that contract as participants of the competition, and you say, "Let's make an agreement with satisfaction and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that there is no price, but the competence of the people," confirmed Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortia is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50 000 received by Strana Quebeku.
Contracts were closed with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devoir, he calculated 109 contracts for advice in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or branches thereof, in particular with laboratories carrying out analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin summed 22 contracts, of which Génivar gained 16 of them, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Énergie gérance".
All the contracts were closed.
They total $49 783 344, including the contract with the company Énergie gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good known for the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has released a report that the PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" before explaining that they are more of its managers.
Responsibilities Barometer - "green" label does not inspire trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebecký consumer very little trusts sustainable development players, as well as "neutral" brands and environmental certificates, to be treated accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst part is that even though we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and urges us to consume socially more responsible, this media universe calls on the lack of reliable information, the failure to fulfil the obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, reports Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell it, they do not believe too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't believe the promises of companies concerning the environment, simply because the green advertising company is finding a measuring tool that has developed the Observatory's responsible consumption of the University in Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates assigned to such calls for fair products, but also of the credibility of products and brands that are identified as ecologically responsible.
In the same way, the policy debate on this issue is accepted as serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, the information on responsible consumption appears to be the primary priority to stimulate this consumption site, which is now almost a third of thequebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromère at a higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekus are putting in distrust of the information on products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, nearly half of consumers were willing to change their habits and especially change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
The entire 61% of them preferred purchases from their district merchants and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, reports Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québeku is happy to present itself as king of recycling, which aims at the least possible environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained outside their car, reports Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of Quebek’s population stated that they use public transport or that they recommend the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walk and bike also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive survey of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of a cinema complex eXcentris
The Quebek government, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the project complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the co-financing but only to the amount of the loan.
The developmental company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent tabloid and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what she required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would have been lower, some of the original expectations that could have set up a basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and resources from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement for 12,8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised for a reduction.
Minister St-Pierre sent the president of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the opposition to the government came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the mortgage of the gift from the state must be truly rejected.
Let us remind ourselves that the Association of Cinema owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec was opposed to direct investment by the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris by stating that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project relating to real estate when it did not do so for other cinemas.
However, a number of participants have, however, requested substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinema during the ten years of film art after he funded the building of the complex, which could be a reason to change from the financial council of the state.
The lack of ballrooms for independent films is glamorous in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in her head, is in charge of the campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that he will spend $700 000 for repressing acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th of the next year and reflect the most beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group are thinking about the proposals for the reduction that are being made to him.
A raised tire on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs mentioned in the knowledge through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of the minority of the Canadians against the Americans, but at the same time, they reveal their feeling of superiority to Canada.
The American diplomats therefore wonder that at every Canadian voter lies at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new reports between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night in public, provide additional sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details of where the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost stuck, may mention political leaders to talk about internal bets rather than to realize that these elections also concern the United States (such as the 1988 free trade campaign) ", writes.
"So the United States are," concluded, "the related elephant in these elections: all the present but potentially too threatening to talk about them".
The ambassador understands this "deep silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better boss of the party to manage these important relationships should be the key factor that voters think when they go to elections."
On 22 January 2009, Terry Brees, Chargé d'Affaires, Ottawa à Ottawa, who is preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure that the government retains confidence in the vote at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit for more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars", writes M. Brees.
Not to mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary meeting so as not to be defeated by coalitions and that opposition parties mention their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington on the increasingly negative picture that the United States has put into the dramatic series broadcast on the NCBs.
The ambassador is concerned about the delivery of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too much of aroused references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also for kidnappings for violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report suggests that at their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kuchner whether Europe is ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánam.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he has presented some paper concerning Omar Khard, the 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, the state secret."
"The mystery accepted that the file would review."
Let us finally know that people who are concerned with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser to Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of the CBC that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destructed".
It was settled and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Light Recovery Plan
The UN proposed in Cancún yesterday a plan for the recovery of home lighting, lighting of shops and industrial space in 100 countries with the aim of achieving a reduction in greenhouse effect (GES), which is in line with almost one-third of the further restrictions to be reached for stabilising the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is located at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN intends to put forward in Cancún to compensate for the lack of difficult realising obligations to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if hot bulbs that are going to monopolise 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace fluo-complicated bulbs or, even better, light-emitting bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be degraded.
The light is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of emissions from the car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them, have been involved in voluntary reduction plans to allow the decline of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it will need to be deducted from this balance of 5 Gt in order to achieve a 2-degree climate heating stabilization by 2020 in order to exclude it from control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of the energy is distributed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a light product.
With fluo compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice more.
The fluo compact bulbs last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new DEL bulbs, which were put into Philips' production this week - this company has reportedly participated in the UN study - have the expected service life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us the idea of a possible storage with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also function with resostates and radiate less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations against fluo compact bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still impossible in developing countries, while the producers would set up collection sites.
Of course, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo compact bulb, but rather a heat coal power plant that releases the many mercurys needed for the production of the power frozen in hot bulbs.
Only in the United States are the ones that put 25,000 tons of mercury each year into circulation.
The report also details the profits each country would have made from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The ivory coast is eagerly awaiting the results of electoral results.
The Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate disclosure of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the end of the time limits set.
"General secretary emphasises the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announces preliminary results, stressed the UN spokesperson."
"He asks all parties in the Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the notification of the results."
Despite the pressures developed by certain foreign governments, the election commission had the lowest date of the vote - Wednesday midnight - without publishing results, three days after Sunday's break.
About 40 minutes before the end of the deadline, President CEI on TV confirmed that the committee 's going on at work' was going to be able to report results.
On Wednesdays around the world, the challenges of CEI were increasing to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round between Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member of Alaska Ouattar.
But Gbagbo's camp is relying on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council for the "Basic" vote in the north, managed by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north of the country were betrayed by President of the Ivory Coast from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council had taken a view of the complaint Gbagbo filed.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the Supreme Court of the Land is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a person from the north who dementes any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of results as 'unavoidable' and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he prevented the electoral commission from sending the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, taking place on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two half years.
The United Nations pointed out at the centre of the political fact that the Ivory Coast could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended up in the first round, on October 31, as a winner with 38% votes compared to 32% for Alaska Ouattar, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédé (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in the Metropolitan France (9.7%, including the overseas regions), as shown by the provisional data with the correction of the seasonal deviations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stood at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In a wider picture, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but wish to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks, so that they can work, no matter whether they are looking for or looking for work.
The situation of current young people on the labour market was still rising with a new increase in unemployment rates of 24.2% in Metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points per three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24.
As regards seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in the Metropolitan France to 6.4% in the Metropolitan France (+0.2 points for three months, as per year), which is 482,000 people from 50 years higher and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 has benefited from the stability of unemployment to 8.3% in the Metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% in France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, however, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) on Tuesday after 9.9% in September.
Alexander Guérini is charged and sentenced to custody
Alexander Guérini, 53 years old, one of the bosses of waste treatment companies and the brother of the PS Administrative Board of Bouches-du-Rhôn, was charged and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of the investigation into public procurement, allegedly obtained.
Alexander Guérini has been charged with the abuse of society's assets, abuse of public funds and public property, confidentiality, provision of bribes, receipt of fees to influence office and possession of ammunition, reports his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him and not some delusions."
"It's easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," she said to AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before questioning his client.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he sent the judge a short message before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than to ensure the functioning of the puzzle he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aubagne Services, was accused on Wednesday for abuse of public funds and composting, and left it free, under the supervision of a ban on contacting, protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation to all the facts that were told to him."
"The investigating judge looks into it and leaves it free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Another four people were charged and released for freedom at night from Tuesday night on Wednesday, with the fact that they're under judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) is being prosecuted for the acceptance of fees in order to influence the Office and for passive corruption."
Two members of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier are charged, one for "restraint and abuse of property", the other for "complot in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's business partner Jeannie Peretti was charged with "covering the abuse of property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérinim, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who have recently been charged with a case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company that they helped to wash money from extensive gangsters.
The investigation is carried out within the framework of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular on waste matters.
From the source of a close investigation, the search mainly focuses on the allocation and operation conditions of dumps in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the city community of Marseille (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace was exaggerated by Syria's mediators
During more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klatilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "spierage", united opinions in France, conducted diplomacy to a combat emergency and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
These are all closely monitored diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to Americans, and went so far that he gave them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French women was not a compensation against the release for the freedom of Majid Kakavanda, Iran in prison in France and the sought American jurisdiction for the sub-contracting of material for the benefit of Iran’s nuclear programme.
Finally, they put a bright light on the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give credit to the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotildy Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris has a headline: "Íran:French comments on how to deal with hostages".
Adviser from the Elysee Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa of the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of the U.S. diplomat Allergrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend that Americans do just as much for them to be brought back to their country by their own citizens in violence held in Iran.
They say, "Be careful to say, "in the media, "the fundamental rights of man," "incompetence," "the equanimous deliverance."
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into trouble, sensitive to its image.
"Do more than that, the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "thing doesn't solve," the Iranians are "misters on evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactics: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the exemption of Clotilda Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, on the day on which it will be granted the refuge of the French embassy) "will request the payment of the high financial amount to the Iranians" (kauce €230 000).
And they're going to announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "sustrates".
In the future, Iranians could arrest others of some 1800 French living in Iran, reports.
28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still blocked in Iran.
The information is spread out: Iran's Majid Kakavand, on which the United States declares that it has been discarded for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a decision by the judge.
As well as many observers, the US Embassy is asking about this worrying consensus.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian network to obtain the material intended for the nuclear program, the deployment of Majid Khakavanda is the bad news.
France has joined the bargain?
Liberation of Iran for the liberation of the young French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures that it is not.
The Elysian Palace, as it states, was not only "the judge's decision was brought to this," but he was looking for the opportunity to stand against it.
"The talks between the Presidential Office and the Justice Minister" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government cannot change the decision of the court", noted.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elyse Palace adviser dials a telephone number, hangs up a telephone caller and then informs the American diplomat that Iranec is currently in Paris's buildings managed by Iran's embassy."
At the time of Klotildy Reiss' prison in Iran, Elysei Palace develops its efforts, negotiates, through the communications and organized "outs" to the media, to convince the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influence" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they say that manipulation carries its fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 provokes the media "blest" of French officials.
On what such a "thanks" peace is based on, expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of their statement, French civil officials acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons for making the Elysian Palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "directs the validation of President Sarkozy's policy to open up to Syria", it analyzes.
Politics applied in 2008 "have been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how far the Syrian role" Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what type of chanters can serve when playing a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also to "sat the grain of nebula between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows it from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier said to him, "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But still, we thanked them."
"It should at least bring confusion and uncertainty between Iran."
Clotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
In communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in helping freeing our country."
End online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival" which will prohibit the adolescences to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, to give representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
" Many children play these games all night and then have problems with teaching at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the director of the Ministry, who has a bill of law to worry about.
On-line games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit daily access times to these games for young people whose parents are asking for it, to complement the responsible worker.
It also offers people who ask for it free programs to reduce time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "occupied" countries and daily press regularly brings various facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, Earth is an unconscionable master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals for the World Cyber Games, face to 58 other nations.
World Championships 2018-2022: Fif is setting up host countries.
Full unrest due to suspicion of corruption, the Fif Executive Committee will establish on Thursday the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the selection of top politically motivated, where fighting for influence and lobbying risk overcoming technical criteria.
The matter is sure, the Fif Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgie).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to conquer the new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that take part in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Head of the Belgian and Netherlands, Zidan, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
The negotiations in the scenes face the risk that they will take up to the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report, Fifa's documentation of the English, Spanish-portugal (2018) and the American (2022) contain the best arguments as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission within an hour to vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of the two members of CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the bullets that so far hosted the world championship only once in a year.
On Monday, the BBC put the crown on it when she broadcasts a document that "scaught on a pin" three powerful members of CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif restless and bring in trouble an English leader with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that led his predecessor to Tony Blair’s function, which he managed to get for the London Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient for England to add new shine to its name with CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the couples of Spain-Portugal do not miss the trumfs of ready stadiums, their well-being (the World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
The possible withdrawal measures against the English and doubts about the payment eligibility of Spain and Portugal are only increasing the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move to Curich and publicly declared "an inconclusive competition in the preparation of the vote", in the words of the comments on the accusations of the English press against the members of CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud on them, we will try to compromise them", said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be logical with its extensive 1994 experience.
The world’s largest economic performance, the headquarters of Fif’s main sponsors, seems to have a great lead before Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have made a beautiful project.
But these candidacys seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 had a "study".
Another threat: the award of World Cup 2026 China, which is keenly wishing for Fif, made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled a large ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fif would continue to expand to new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for chatty TV fees paid by European countries, creating the momentum for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (assistance)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up to the idea that he was weighting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The Mandate of the Elysian Palace calls someone else.
Thus, the current head of the State will be the candidate in 2012.
But clarity is not in good agreement with a share of secrets associated with the Presidency's functions.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persist.
In both ways.
In 2006, without any confidence, Jacques Chirac’s friends made claims that the third mandate should not be excluded.
November 15 with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that "the decision sometimes takes place in autumn 2011".
As it recalls before the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" was low.
Was it his candidature's official announcement?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 reduced the number of five years of office to two.
It was just his record, not his announcement.
It is not the first time in such meetings that the presidential election is to be reminded by the humorous tone of such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you still have seven and a half years ahead of you", he did in July 2009.
Rebelia in May 2010: "Do not think about the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than a previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of a double truth.
Speeding the way to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not an entrance to Ségolèna Royal's colliding Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
It is, on the contrary, because of his candidacy in 2012, it is evident that many in PS want to arrange for combat teams more premature than intended.
Bad recon on the other side.
First, the right-wing voters would prefer the French Phillon's candidacy against Nicolas Sarkozy (46%), according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this issue with the UPP," they reacted immediately and observant people from the nearest area of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes possible defeat, he will not run," Jean-Pierre Raffarin reports.
"He'll always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank has been forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Central in the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for out-of-criminalisation or, at least, to notify a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis in the sovereign European debt binds, without a doubt, the issuing institution will not allow it to be so categorical in terms of deterioration of the situation today so tightly attached to European securities markets.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French finance minister Christine Lagarde gave tribute the active role played by the Central European Bank in helping solve the crisis by European countries.
She did not want to say whether she thought that the bank could do more, for example by increasing their programme of purchasing sovereign bonds.
"I express my consideration for my European partners... ".
In the evening before, in Brussels, in his hearing of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more exclusive in terms of his intentions and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for buying state titles on the secondary market "supples" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting which took place this Thursday.
The only security: The Central European Bank will keep its basic unaltered interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds made by the Central European Bank have doubled to nearly € 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the misunderstandings of the dealors on the market, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds were made yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s overall central banks bought EUR 67 billion from May 2010.
There is no doubt among the anti-dumping agreements on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank’s arsenal, the latter designated bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of causing short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"Progressive East announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", is presented by Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In order to plan its public debt market intervention, "in order to maintain the volume of purchase by the European Central Bank of its bonds in order to reinvigorate the weak market", Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the exposure of the European banks to markets with sovereign debt in the euro area, there is nothing left to choose from but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at any cost and act in such a way as to prevent the flooding of paid performances of the states, which are among the most fragile," said the major bond administrator yesterday.
Because if interest rates were to take off, the states would be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's back
After the beginning of the week for Italy’s disturbing situation a little relaxed, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Back to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, as she qualified the situation as "unsolvable" and that she expected "unforeseeable" a weekend, which was then demented.
In any case, in Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, which caused some interference in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Lett, declared himself "too busy" to "serious development of markets" and possibly a disease from Ireland.
"Good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stellar, economist at Hudson Institute.
Right and undetected, its problem is the absence of growth and unimaginable fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The most recent forecasts of Brussels were cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth has since been expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, it calculates the European Commission, the deficit of public finances will represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (compared to 3.9% of the envisaged government) and 3.5% in 2012 ( instead of 2.7%).
From there, the reputation of a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken", says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For this moment Italy accepts support for international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time", ensures Arrigo Saddan, Italian member of the International Monetary Fund Board, under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), efforts to stabilise are required in Italy less than those required by other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economist of OCDE.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for distrust of the Chamber of Deputies and, after that, they could begin to organise elections with which it counts at the end of March.
Thus, a period would be initiated, little suitable for the adoption of a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde pointed out it again yesterday at the press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans have demonstrated this on Sunday and all day long, are obviously very solidarityy, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, last night's expansion of interest on European state bonds has brought water to the mills of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's notation office has announced that it could degrade the Portuguese debt record, the objective of which is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, consisting especially of banking systems," says the economists Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that "political time runs slower than market time".
Scientifically, the conflicted context and danger that hides is enhanced by the European countries' discussions to strengthen their already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, the most affected problems, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are developed very well.
In view of the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group since the beginning of the next week.
The Central European Bank is held today.
The programme has the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with market focus (see above).
As regards the European Finance Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, failed on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not intended to raise funds, then it prepares the land to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected to be next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed the Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funding by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
Countries which are first of all, Portugal and Spain are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from those used by Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, that they would seek international assistance before they can apply their own budgetary corrections and than decide on structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
The capitalists in European funds are finally talking about options that are available to speed up the normalisation process of markets with sovereign bonds.
On its way to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came to the idea of not enough EUR 750 billion of mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to reinvent the stock of securities.
The economists from Barclays Capital, which is an actr of the very first trading plan with European sovereign claims, considers that the addition of some EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "sights" in the form of direct financial liquidity provision.
There is a point: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, up to this date with EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and water: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing difficulties in transport, especially in the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that certain economic activities are disrupted.
Twenty-four periods have an orange emergency since now due to the risk of snow and flooding.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined 20 districts which have already declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snow flows are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the woods of Charentes and the snowing on the Ile-de-France.
The snow cover ranges from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are planted.
Snow benefits are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and to disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to the police, and police recommend driving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some truckers has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
No special measures shall be envisaged on Wednesday evening.
The district office " calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt driving nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Airport and 10% on Orly due to expected snow flows.
DGAC recommends to passengers using air transport services to join their company.
In the UK, until Thursday morning, the Gatwick Airport is closed in south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France has been going on, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We especially remind you of the 23 billion Grand Paris Metro to build the Society of Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State will notify the grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is purely theoretically the amount which will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for the contract.
We're finally getting to our first additions today.
The 2010 Reciliation Act on Finances, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and raising taxes from the office at Ile-de-France.
One, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The statement from this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices that already exist, "to be upgraded to increase the yield obtained from it and to make this increase touch with Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Over.
That's not calculated in the text.
We're four billion away.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy that will be mobilised by the State and placed in Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"From the moment we have created income (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then work to 4 billion, it is explained here."
"This will be included in the budget and used as necessary".
SGP considers 4 billion to be credited up to 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billions promised belong to non-objective subscribers, risks creating a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be held on 7 December.
Creature hackers and causeful witnesses
WikiLeaks case has a dual meaning.
On the one hand, there is a manifest scandal, a scandal that seems to be scandalous only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, he talks about deep changes at international level and is taking over the future of control of regression.
But let's do it all the time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this confirms that each document produced by a secret service (some people) consists solely of printing cuts.
The "Murmor revelation" of Americans about the way of sex life of Berlusconi is announced what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all except those two Berlusconi owns) and the misguided caricature profile of Kadafi has been a long time for cabaret artists the subject of sketches.
The rule that secret documents can only be obtained from messages already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (by Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Zednařích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And that's not only because the author of the cover texts doesn't like to look for new information (not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe only what they already know and what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of secret services (and if not, could be, as I know, the editor in the paper Libération), who considers only what he himself admits.
The information with a high cover on Berlusconi, which the U.S. embassy sent to the State Department, was the same newsweek before.
So, then, why have there been so much fuss about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of the states can telephone or fly off by plane to dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few little exercises in representations, have transformed into a spy centre.
Any viewer watching the movies about the investigation very well knows that it's obviously ignoring itself from the liquor.
However, the fact that this happens publicly, the shameful duty of hypocrisy, and it casts the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most stringent classified information from the world's most powerful countries is a hard strike, not a negligible one, for the essence of this State resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "contractor".
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some big Brother, who checked every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction done, a hotel visited, a highway used, and so on, the citizen became a complete victim of the prison of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even "wrecks" with the most classified information on the power can't resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a contemporary.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as a representative of a citizen, may know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep his own secrets?
It is true that George Simmel has already said that the true secret is an unobtrusive secret (and unfamiliar secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly mysterious secret, because it is pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was unobtrusive secrets, means taking away all his power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this bountiful power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the poster, glued on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely clear that current technologies are useless to hope that you can keep a secret message on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and joined one of its colleagues.
How can they be kept private and sensitive messages in the future?
For this moment, I know that she has a prognosis in science fiction and therefore it is fantastic, but I must imagine the government officials who are transporting discreetly to perform formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those reports that know confusion or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
Information will be kept in unique copies of the plug-in with the key: quite again, an attempt to spy in Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward now, which means backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephonics).
Videotapes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to shoot a movie step by step, push it forward and look back and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CD (numbers) only allow them to jump on chapters, that means macropors.
By means of quick-traines we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way to the plane and transport that includes the need for three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques will return to vehicles loaded with horses.
Last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was happening in the secret of the embassy.
It is now the embassy that requests confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked her promises on financing
Year after Copenhagen agreement, it is time to try to follow the promises to quickly unlock funding (recommended financing with fast start (fast start) or early), implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were exposed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, advanced countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (this is €420 million a year).
During the launch of COP16, the EU has pulled out a large essay to convince its partners of the integrity of its commitment to finance fast start: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, press conference, grand side event, distribution brochures...
Excessive and valuable operations: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that EUR 2.2 billion was released in 2010, which brings it to the right path to keeping its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that increased load is implemented without public development aid being harmed.
Unfortunately, there's no match for what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered it a reference year 2009: international financing has been preserved and it adds 150 million to three years of funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or dates at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there are no references to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publica développement.
In particular, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), is to keep up with its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another decisive element is the distribution to donations and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider 1€ of the loan to be 1€ of the gifted one.
Clearly, it is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for certain investments that are profitable (at times, projects linked to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), is a foolish presentation of one euro that we will get as the equivalent of one euro we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
However, France can only submit such justifications: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million, making it EUR 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million) and EUR 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes use of the loan in such a way.
Germany requested 46% from this place, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other parts) respect their obligations with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives € 1€ in compliance with its promise, France will only give 10 cents and considers this effort to be comparable.
Beautiful boygie bit!
For summaries, in its financing of the "fast start" France is operating with a double-swimming industry: on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although only EUR 36,1 million is issued, he can convince that he is spending EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The mandate of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although Bercy, who made such a decision), could have two negative impacts, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to give when they just need to borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of pre-financing is only a small ovation, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But it could also be sand grain in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw the knowledge from this first year of early financing.
At first, France should announce a change in its accounting record for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and respect for justice and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But, first of all, France should avoid discussing deposits in long-term financing (another essential chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of "accidentity" or of the way in which the loan is settled.
France should change its position in order to become so progressive with these deposits, such as others.
So everyone's hope is putting in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscia-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international trust necessary to continue discussions.
The pesticide alarm that the kids will eat.
A ten - year - old child will die on one day 81 of various chemicals, according to one study published by this Wednesday, from the Association of Future generations (ex-Hungary for rights and conservation of future generations).
The association, which points out that its results "are not significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processing issue", bought food commonly consumed in four dishes and one light meal as a single child about ten years in the supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, 42 of which include carcinogenic, possible or probable substances, and five substances include clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for glands with internal exchange (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or the EP is surprising," says the association.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, there are about ten residies with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as about 20 residues that could interfere with the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, presented studies as small snacks, contains traces of six chemicals, including, among other things, France, a prohibited means of fungicity.
The same applies to green bean from Kenya, included in lunch, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, milk-meat bifettes, canned tuna, and even mushrooms, and gums were powdered with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrates and chloroform has been revealed in the water tap of the analysis.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to warm the meals in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this 'contamination coefficient' is likely to be underestimated', results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Zelielenie (EE-LV) team proposed "to form an urgent situation" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilization diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereal.
