Welsh Assembly Members Fear They'll 'Look Like Muppets'
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed at the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for the proposal is plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party said his group is concerned that it “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group approaches the name change "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on how members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where wide support was received by the variant of calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of Assembly members, the committee preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may bring concerns to President Elin Jones, who is due to table a draft legislation within weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
A popular vote should resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not be guided by the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells go silent as churches in Harlem struggle to survive
“The old people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
“There is none today.”
The disappearance of the bar is understandable.
“People meet in different ways today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living room of a neighborhood where people regularly go.”
When it comes to churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who would not help the remaining tabernacles in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who move into the apartments will become church members.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping boulevard in Harlem who refused to employ or promote blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a chimes.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes "bells of the poor."
The expert, who played the chimes in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first chime played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger chime in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has been the setting of a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have been called by lay representatives of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders, sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the council of elders, although the latter did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived for Lobsters in California
According to an official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season began.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he overheard the boy calling for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he considered the call at first to be the joy of catching the lobster, but then "realized it was screaming 'He bit me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had torn the whole area of the clavicle."
“I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported in a critical condition by helicopter to the San Diego Children's Hospital Council.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s wants to take on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with store-style beauty aisles, where specialist saleswomen will be available.
With the UK cosmetics market taking a strong take-up of 2.8 billion pounds and continuing to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, spread to other stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find uses for shelves previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space thanks to branded locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also reintroduces its range of Boutique makeup, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the franchises of Fragrance Shop, the first such store opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the next this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago. This has increased food sales and makes acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to remake the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the connection ended after a dispute over the distribution of drug revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds to the firm of Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is set to play its part by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues that customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and the enticing environment and convenient location mean we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are changing the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby withdrew from her 11-million-pound contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was “furious” when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their homewear and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts - worth up to  1.5 million pounds.
The venture was likened to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of presenter Willoughby at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the brand, Jones set off from Britain to one of her summer residences.
An unnamed source said: “Truly was Holly’s top priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would secure her for several decades to come.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
There's a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s top stars, could cost the company millions due to a bold investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes, and a possible further delay in the launch of the brand.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The pair go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult action "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from journalists for a remark that some consider "unworthy of a president" and for how positively he speaks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with a mocking “preacher’s” voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
After recognizing their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is looking forward to another meeting.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remains of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to reporting on his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been driven from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it’s a bit challenging,” Ms. Sumbung says.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear if foreign staff can work there.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr Sutupo said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be allowed to assist.
With earthquakes occurring very frequently in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared to the wrath of Mother Nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but this is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning of tsunamis in Paul was likely to have contributed to the loss of human lives, although a warning was issued.
Even in the best of times, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And with natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a major point in President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding shortfalls.
President Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He tossed the ball to his left and fired at the far stick.
The shot flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped the jumping Kepu Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn't think much about it and he fired at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent his passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
He then sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in the lime.
He escaped defense and ended with a left to the far pole next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
At 15:00 on Wednesday, Liverpool will face the local team in the Champions League group stage at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15:00 in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, causing waves as high as 6 meters and trapped many people in the ruins of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Paulu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning, and police immediately opened a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55am on Grayson Mews on John Street. On suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has moved near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation,"
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrive at the scene thinking they know the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police say they are investigating and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours to be able to return home.
A police officer told one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
A number of police officers are stationed in the closed area to monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and enter the code 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit due to a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for having his fanatical Taliban-style Puritan followers destroy a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Palace of Westminster would be one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or practice iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of a 19th-century view and part of the character's historiography that many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, though less so today than at the end of the 19th century, to be the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of constant historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer pig rips up Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery in a puddle of blood near a piggy bank in the Liu-phan-shui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pigsty open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the pigsty with a mouth full of blood.
According to the information, it was confirmed during the forensic examination that the 250-kilogram pig ripped the farmer.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang told Evening News, citing his cousin's surname as "Wu."
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was closed so no one else would think when police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with the Yuan family over compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and was driven away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the US
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
In the coming days, however, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the US.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa had a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure furrow forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the US. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture north to the southwest of the US.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity will cause heavy rains in the south-west of the USA in the coming days as the low pressure furrow approaches.
Precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous torrential flooding, rubble flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the U.S., especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, torrential flooding can occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local gusts of gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure furrow will bring heavy local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller streams of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, isolated tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is nearly 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to spread the lingering summer heat.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. territory is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures of around 27°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
In New York City, it could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s eye-catching testimony on six TV channels of Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with announcers interrupting routine programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was groping her drunk at a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited testimony that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company counted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast the testimonies, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the playoffs or awarding Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership of any station, with an average of 5.69 million viewers following him during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him on Friday morning as he was about to take the elevator to a court hearing.
CNN broadcast live how he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and let himself be scolded.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the Judicial Commission was to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of “politicians” over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “politicians” over Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other was "absolutely meaningless".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to CBS' WABF channel, police seized the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson admitted after questioning that he shot Wayde.
According to the defense attorney, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for "sawing and pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death "shaken" the team and "shocked" him.
“That’s what you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash on Mexico City
The ash that flows from the volcano Popaciatepetl hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of rumblings and tremors.
Images of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people engaged in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that split Catalonia.
Police officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, skirmishes broke out, which the police had to use batons to calm.
Within hours, independence groups chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of protesting supporters of the union who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to end voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Groups supporting independence remained outside overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration took place, she had to choose a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest, said he no longer hoped to gain independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are at a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence had to fight to keep things running this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile themselves or waited in court for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after a car hit the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were jailed after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
At one point, a crossbow may also have been fired at the car.
Meng's goal secures Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 matches in the role of the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership this season on the guest pitch and will face the first Hearts to lose eight points next Sunday.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extended his unbeaten streak in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has yet to experience a defeat.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the lackluster guests
Holt's team should have led long before the goal, because his directness caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow in the slip just narrowly missed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
It was enough for the home team to watch the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they could torment the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers a free kick was ordered and Livingston formed a loophole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Menga, who the ball in the center of the penalty area flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed out on another standard Livingston situation.
The penalty area of Livingston was constantly flown by centers, which players were continuously cleaning, and two penalty kicks came to nothing - after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
"The Phenomenon" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception outstanding and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for how he has roused the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a well-ordered defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby at all times.
Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't live up to those standards anymore.
Their endgame was poor - they only made it home once - and it should be a wake-up call for Rangers as they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, September 29, the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people - many of them Kurds - were also heard protesting against Erdogan, condemning his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the controversy of a visitor whom some German Turks hailed as a hero, while others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the junction of Bestwood Street with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death occurred just a few months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the riots at the men's high-security prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. local time and are still ongoing.
To cope with the riots, in which eight prisoners in one wing were involved, specialized guards from the "Tornado" team were called in.
Peacekeepers suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison, specially trained prison workers were deployed.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and can spend longer periods behind bars."
There are more than 500 inmates at Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had ended up in the hospital after the inmate's attack.
And last October, law enforcement units were called to the prison due to serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (areas where drought may be beneficial)
It’s not common for low-pressure tropical furrows to hit Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and carries the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a Twitter post that "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm status or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona at times up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local totals of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not in danger of torrential flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the area has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious matter, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the southwest of the US has just been hit by drought.
Weather.com reports that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least “extreme drought,” the second highest category, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be heavy, posing a high risk of flooding.
"In the region from Baja California to northwest Sonor, total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm likely to occur," weather.com reports.
Rosa will then travel as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north, arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then passing through Arizona and entering southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main risk for Rosa or her remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the desert southwest of the U.S.,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly torrential floods and streams of rubble in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
Avon and Somerset police said young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
Police are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘experienced the wickedness and rage’ of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the wickedness and rage” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said on Saturday that the day “was a witness to Kavanaugh’s brilliance and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that "the vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service to his credit."
The president indirectly alluded to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans taking part in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before some of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m still on the move,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
An adviser to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the death toll continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people lost their lives after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, but at dusk, the coast was hit by up to six-meter waves, which killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they fell victim to the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not go by itself, it took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave was spreading at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He stated that some people fled the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences also rocked the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful quake was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have magnified the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found wedged under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho reported that the amount of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "completely crippled without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that workers and volunteers were heading to the affected sites.
“This is a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for failing to report that Palu was hit by a tsunami, although authorities said the waves came at a time when warnings were issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is heard desperately warning people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast is hit by a water wall that takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the report immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for aid transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where workers were hiding in shelters made of custom-built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When aid groups began the sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin flowing to the site of the calamity when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not yet the case.”
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, the friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the bleak stories of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled from the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been involved in paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr Gendon recounted how in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse, the paragliding community was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to Pal contestants attending the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a grey mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves Take $26,750 While Replenishing ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
While doing so, another man “runs out from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to be put into an ATM.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, tweeting: "A being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
West had previously said that the word had religious meaning for him in addition to shortening his current professional name.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible where ‘you’ is used,” West said earlier this year, speaking to Big Boy about the album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye, as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
Many other famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
West's former associate JAY-Z also alternated his name with and without a hyphen and both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican PM vows not to use military against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening other free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
According to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government published announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for AI.
Last year, China launched a plan to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further away than the U.S. and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee told CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the top American player in Othello, and later was a senior research fellow at Microsoft and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Challenge, and asked when it would be next to help identify the new visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“Academic leaders are not led by China, they are led by corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the United States improve its efforts in the field of AI.
“In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to holders of a doctorate in AI,” he says.
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it now invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents object that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters will attend for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems were reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country's path to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls out chairs in front of tents set by people who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not the door for the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
A “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The referendum’s failure would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has scored a goal in Brighton's defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguero's performance, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine forward got in the middle of the field.
He advanced between the three Brighton defenders and made it into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overtook several others.
The next pass to the left was Sterling.
The English striker tapped the ball back to Aguer in the penalty area, who right-handedly overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguero has a foot problem,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he’d play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to score a goal at the time.”
However, the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
To his left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant pole.
The Sky Blues striker tapped the ball into the net just before it slipped off the field.
City will play with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Champions League group stage at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to re-enter.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher's place against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday - but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a playoff hope.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Even if we’re not playing for anything, we can at least have a good time, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team will probably play with the most effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start, and he would practice on Thursdays and pitch on Sundays when he is usually free.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has 18-7 statistics this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump attends a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of Republicans taking part in mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
There are five weeks left in one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones - I'm not running, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he added, saying Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud booing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you take out the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momento activists in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome - because they have honestly given their opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in the admonition for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party's Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
For most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings are not going on these days, and the promise of a “kinder, kinder” policy has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues whom I had previously thought we had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180° and hold positions that I otherwise could not agree with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a tirade of abuse on social media, calling for my dismissal, condemning the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never back down.
One aspect of this era of politics that I’m most disappointed about is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised many times to hold back, not talk so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which literally let my general school class fall apart, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is breaking into a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting on what I believe is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ayr Rises to the Top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun match of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are at the head of the table, as the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All the honor of Ayr, they took the chance better than we did."
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released for the Warriors' match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot earned the unconverted five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty and then scored exactly at half-time and converted a solo try, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
This was followed by a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on a stretcher, and when the play began again, Ayr leapt again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five-man turn by Climo.
Acting captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra player thanks to the unconverted five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given yellow for attacking Clim without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty line-up put the ball behind the advancing maul Ayr.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's winger for the fifth home five.
Still Game Star Launches New Career in Hospitality
It seems that the star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 65-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC programme he writes in which he stars alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series, and Kiernan appears to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Inland Bolivia hopes court reopens way to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol outside the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
Sea bases off Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the slogan: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to get it.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coasts that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody resource war of the 19th century - as well as the desire to roam the Pacific Ocean again.
These aspirations are perhaps the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court, which is expected to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD's decision on big screens across the country with the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after many decades of intermittent talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - is also very interested in Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia - and even if it did, much would have changed.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “wasn’t complicated,” as Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, says.
And the last four years have not only failed to support the cause of Bolivia, but may have hindered it.
“The current Bolivian government has taken over the issues of access to the sea,” Zarate says.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric has weakened all of Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will one day start negotiating again, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if the US can’t believe it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made at the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has stalled, more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “hopeful” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War could ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headwear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy giant headgear for their Spring/Summer 2019 collections at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers, which flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were decorated with melons, a witch's hat, and even pineapple - but they are not meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion - you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could arrive in fashion stores as well.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter wide crematorium worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag, which is almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that carries it.
A dark orange raffia bag lined with raffia fringes and fitted with a white leather handle was an exhibition piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores next summer - given the designer's success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other outstanding exam results. Individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other community activities underline this.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the careers they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
This is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages are at the top of the charts, with independent schools having the highest success rates.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by pupils are equally valued in the study plans of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons cited by employers as problems in filling vacancies, 17 per cent are language skills deficient.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in the outlook to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, they will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are vitally important to the country's future in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will play for the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James playing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be able to enjoy it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening game of the preseason in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign appearances tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term election as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s speech start tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which was very tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed for a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five rallies next week are aimed at “giving energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of the Senate is so important to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania could attend today’s meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and the Pittsburgh media could watch it.”
This will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he scored more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to help him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Its Stomach to Fight to Keep Hope Ahead of Sunday's Singles
After three one-sided matches, the Saturday pair may be just what Ryder Cup needed.
Swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
“They knew by six points and now it’s four, so we think the pendulum is moving a little bit towards us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, it leads by four points, and there are still twelve left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can cheer them up, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas playing together all day long and each boasting three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly in the transition from tee to green and sets an example.
The famous shouts further intensified in the continuation of his lap as he mastered the key stalemate to win the entire match when they were two holes behind Tomas.
His putt, which won them the match for 15 holes, was met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deep and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that each of these players has left behind.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way the energy flows both towards the stormy audience and from him confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on a different hole.
However, talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio García, the hero of the morning's four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles on the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in an abyss from which they no longer climbed.
No one will be able to help you on Sunday.
Two-to-two ball games are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in a couple, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and took a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two pairs also showed that the US team has the stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
Europe leads Ryder Cup final day with 10-6 points
Europe will get a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's two-ball games came out with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who are said to have won almost twice over struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four notches at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning two-ball games with the American side failing in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, winning two games, but could not get into a deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they beat the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more forcefully 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in a pairing of two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after playing two balls in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a pairing game for a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and number three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris won on the whole line.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas broke two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a rough 2&1 win over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to defeat the pairing of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pairing game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team returned from a four-point deficit to singles, although as a defending Furyk side, he only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days it seems there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued U.N. sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and in such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see an adequate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri echoed known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had already gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, even objecting to ‘declaring an end to the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed at the UN earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea and not the US were to side with this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a stalemate."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of U.S. missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump described Kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and ceaselessly until we become aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress Pyongyang's funding of nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made only for North Korea to declare within hours that it was making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all of its students sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night long while students are awake and cheering themselves up with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most renowned university are often clueless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were really seriously sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive assignments.
In one section, there is a picture of student dormitories where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also on the rise.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making the person still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes took during his freshman year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the entire course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when a hit by Dolly Mengy cemented Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox side tried to record their first win from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points away from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts leaders.
Menga struck seven minutes ahead of halftime and the Rangers lineup seemed uninspired and determined to level up.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind the Hibernian team on a one-wicket difference.
And there could be other problems for Rangers after the line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side that swept past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up a Hearts point last week and would have been pleased to see his well-trained team suffocating their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman onto Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' far free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour lead when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers only managed two shots per goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it already for the toil.
The Rangers once again failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and teased Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took the action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing plunged into Morelos, but the formidable Kelly fought his way from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after another.
Holt's side may have deepened their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another delayed penalty claim when he tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and it is still growing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms being emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Yeah, he’s really into it now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivet is injected again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them into a laboratory, so they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be reapplied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “taught” them to focus on cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga cap, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live studios after a confused performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that evening called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began spitting on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had a problem with racism, I wouldn’t have been in America long ago,” he said.
The SNL launched a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which a Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegation of the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speaking was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to viewers that he got his head adornment nicely eaten even behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with the hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," he told the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" adding that he would "put on his Superman suit because it means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments earned only a booing audience at least twice, and SNL members looked outraged, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio has gone completely silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR BUILDING A MASS."
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "just was who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I don’t want to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges brought will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The actor, 31, however, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such on-screen roles meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes “something is wrong” and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he was "quite vocal" about the issue.
"At the moment I personally feel quite strongly - what happened to masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we’re seeing here?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, from them growing the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a side?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because I'm sure something's changed for the worse for young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series was completed, as he has had enough of "fights and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's restored True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and all my subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Kit's character Jon Snow's love interest, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from a lack of sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senators' data, flaunts terms of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned claims that a member of her staff had sent the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wikis.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were supported by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during Senate hearings on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that the sources of the posts are linked to the Waters office and published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including one from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the plaintiff's motives.
They need to be calm and unexcited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticized because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Back: A Weaker Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It’s already common to look for Brexit in every new British film, which seems to be the case with this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire on the topic of how obviously bad a nation we are be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this contorted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to mess things up again in a whole new way - that name more than anything else a signal that it is a broad comic creation designed for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the blunt secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big piece of that guy who blew a single note in the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left chaos behind.
There are one or two good moments in this latest issue of JE.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade briefly clinked about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a surefire component of their production.
The humor is more as if it were intended for children than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy troubles are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's persona.
The current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, much to the dismay of an agent on duty - a role too small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who is already suffering under the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character as well as she can, but there is not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as soon as any of her active spies are threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
That is, Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury establishment, but at the same time passing on record lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall due to an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affectated figure that Vicki Pepperdine's talent may even be a little wasted on.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in a quest for Her Majesty's Secret Service, and they meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously succumbs to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's cybercrime: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical patals: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak aboard Volt's luxury yachts; and English sets off pure anarchy when they attempt to use virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All the aces are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something of a children's television in it.
Quite a moderate matter.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for the English to work four days a week and get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to hand over to the workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-time Labour MP told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is a wish that fits into the party’s stance on balancing the economy for the benefit of both the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their total shareholding, as the Labour government could make "deductions" based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create equity funds that will hand over 10% of the private enterprise's equity to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
RELATED: Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation might have changed their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Office's findings could sway any Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes," correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal."
But Graham’s decision is unshakable.
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would be a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
Global Citizen will welcome tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “events” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, they will change something?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, seeking to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing pledges and actions of more than $37 billion to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that hedge funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential”, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a point out of the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for the Power of Nutrition project, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mother and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, they ask, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s edition in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy for ‘blockade’ to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can resort to the navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked to make sure that their energy is not going to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is taken as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington's approach and dealings with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less investing in or replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “single-purpose” player with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a stance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “take a close look” at 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "take a close look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including our top female position,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting, saying she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD Track at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, may be related to other families who are suffering the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives to their country at all.
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new measures by the U.S. government that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and a district in Washington on Friday issued a brief message to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of a violent gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates for states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the U.S. overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the friend said.
Lawyers further succinctly argued that policies that deny immigration harm the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary jobs."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence as early as June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum has never had the goal of alleviating all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the death toll has doubled, race to find survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her febrile baby boy at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were crippled.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the feeling that a violent earthquake had shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, sharing a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advert in the U.S. daily devoted to the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the China Daily surcharge paid in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional election on November 6.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to run commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s precious tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Contrary to that, in a newsstand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissent and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrisome economic path, given that the media belongs to the firm of the ‘Chinese Communist Party’,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" its article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave voters ahead of election over Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Chief Justice Brett Kavanaug, who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans on record are already saying they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute efforts to investigate the FBI would be enough to reassure voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a rally in the Senate corridor where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.”
However, it could be higher, especially among faltering female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that resistance might follow if Republicans confirmed.
“It got away with a confusing mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the chair, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it," Guy Cecil, the U.S. director of priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in their view of whom to trust in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, told The Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project collaborated on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about bringing about a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a media post published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Clergyman Who Received the Victoria Cross during World War I
Centuries have passed since the sole clergyman of the Church of England won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone to him on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "geniusly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's triumphant feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and strong firing from field guns and machine guns."
He later got to the front line and with "highest courage" led the line forward, before throwing himself into the firing field and knocking out three separate units.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but also something that’s humiliating.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt a great honor to be able to participate in the show,” adding that “the valor of a true hero is manifested in the support that a lot of people will give.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the pompous Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The bill from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and a live broadcast in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their match, viewers in the UK were left in awe as the newscast turned into a show about Peppa Pig.
Some remained undisturbed after waking up for the match until the early hours of the morning.
One fan on Twitter described the change in airing on the children's show as "a form of bad joke."
“According to the government’s order, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, after being asked about the broadcast.
"Pippa Piglet," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the programme so that audiences in the UK will be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we can't make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went back and forth, and not all of them were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
“We’re going to reduce it to five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we didn’t make it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘minor’ because of his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to go after success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Disc, which was introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke aloud about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that because of the opportunity to become a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter on the long-running show, had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Lavern's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness have been real things that have given me the strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone who might find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT rights campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has caught him off guard."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so much at such a young age - he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer - he said it was not easy to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley said his whole point of view had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been like, ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not come to terms with his death, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front ranks.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew I'd dreamed about it all my life - jumping in front of our domestics at the Olympic Games, I don't know a better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Current, which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and kept him going.

Mickelson, who was out of form, finished on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would reach the record on Sunday when he played 47, a Ryder Cup match, but would have to tweak the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the events held every two years for the twelfth time, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's four-balls and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the US, the five-time main winner spent his day alternating between cheerleading and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth Sunday game, winning all four of his games on the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who were four points short, had started 12 separate swords, escaping the rapid onset, Mickelson's sword might have proved absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and added nothing else.
“He totally understands the role he had today, he patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Straw and in the past this week has been so beneficial for these teams.
I couldn't imagine him playing two swords.
I was imagining more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go that way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record in most of the Ryder Cup's Wests played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has achieved 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his team presence has yielded some intangible results.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also had fun coming to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big leadership may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead towards the singles of the last few days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they made it to the finish straight with a completely close win of 141 ?2-131 ?2.
“You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not over.
Tomorrow you will be bored.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and get the trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I would focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with how his players performed on the difficult golf course, added: “I could never have done it alone.
Tomorrow we have another animal.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that’s too hard.
It’s great to be out with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there on your own, your golf player’s capacity is fully checked.
That's the message you have to give to the players, to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's opponent will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scoring three out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team at Brooklin, to then end up as a loser when Europe reached the "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, said when asked how he encouraged his players to head out to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly like in Brooklyn, like in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set the line-up accordingly and made the boys feel like you know, as if we were going to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match against the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I went with that group of boys in that order because I think it covers the whole journey,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
German warship delayed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media reported.
The commissioning of the command ship Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a citing army spokesman.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project more difficult.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will serve as replacements for the aging Bremen-class frigates, which the Navy ordered as early as 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long maintenance times - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the high-end naval ships - which were supposed to enable Germany to send forces overseas - will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of major "software bugs and defects on the metal elements" defects that would render the warship unusable when deployed.
The defects in the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - half the workers needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to have considerable excess weight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects on the metal elements, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price has risen to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates have gained importance especially in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed “running out of ships to deploy.”
This official stated that the problems had been continuously piled up as the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a bat settlement in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities for the conservation of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland, will track whistling bats and the smallest and brown long and water bats in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat settlement to monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will find out the frequency of calls of bats and what each species is doing.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be issued, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and best practices in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined greatly in the past century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments for building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, colony inspections and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threeve housing estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson states that this is the ideal area for them.
“We have a great area for bats here at Threave,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work on real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one parent nesting site can kill up to 400 females and pups, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hand in the work and help.
She said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges and His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
This Portuguese man and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorgy, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent on the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video, calling the information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball award winner to the camera.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are about to charge the daily Der Spiegel with unsubstantiated charges, which they described as “unacceptable reports of suspicion in the private sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Las Vegas Casino.
After dating at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the arcade, where, according to documentation filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he had anal-raped her.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” “claus” and “one percent” disappointed.
In the documents, it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of reprisals" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to resume driving because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo has been bought by Manchester United’s Real Madrid club for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret loss of car makers
The UK will “forever regret” losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Greg Clark, secretary to companies, said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“A deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
At the Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced, they produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading the fear of leaving the EU without a deal in terms of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers describe as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just in time” basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts, the industry said.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would have been halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU were “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the union at the plant, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
A high-level meeting between Donald Trump and acting attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by “another week” as the fight for the Supreme Court continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who examines interference in the Russian election, the ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump releases the acting attorney general and thereby threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip has been feeding on this for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he came to the White House surrounded by news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he “wouldn’t” release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed so it wouldn’t interfere with a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no date yet, it may be this week, maybe it will be necessary to move another week in view of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I will always keep the media informed."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were due to an aversion to the "theater" of television reporters, although she said "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more question and answer sessions than any president before him,” she added, without providing evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying and you've seen that we've been doing it in the last few weeks and that there will be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health minister tells EU staff at NHS Scotland not to worry about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of requests for settlement status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continue on the way to the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to assure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our fervent wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee Tigers forward Christion Abercrombie has advanced emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put oxygen on Abercrombie's sideline and then put him on a stretcher and prepared him for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had advanced surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet available about the type/range of injuries" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in a red shirt, completes his first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five overall saves, which means a total of 18 saves in a season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with extra money being used to help the homeless as part of Tory’s new plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move to attract young voters.
Higher property tax increases will apply to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury is expected to increase by 120 million euros a year to help homeless people.
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher property purchase tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and a focus on high-income people.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, while the extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleep deprivation.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase the funds by up to EUR 120 million per year.
Estimates say that 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving out prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to make it home.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on property purchases to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to remedy the "disadvantage of houses" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an engaging array of proposed housing reforms, including managing rents and ending "flawless" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said I wanted to dedicate my efforts as prime minister to renewing the British dream of every new generation having a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives.
However, it may not be right to make it easy for non-UK entities and foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too remote, and the disgrace of sleeping without a roof over their head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says he has a “highest ambition” to become Scotland’s manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently holds third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
He switched to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B rank and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross's predecessors in the role of managers of Sunderland were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at that time would be measured by the question of whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him back, but I would probably feel successful if I could bring the club back."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, having previously served as an assistant boss at Dumarton and spent 15 months as among the Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third group and transformed St Mirren from an incipient decline to a champion title winner the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls when Alloa took over.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in management.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now I’m doing it, and I feel like I feel the most in my whole adult life right now.”

Research has found that a great time to pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the incomes of British pubs struggling, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures show that pub and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the consulting firm that produced the final reports, said: “The stable sunshine and the longer-than-expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pub traffic increased by 2.8 per cent but restaurants were hit even more.
The decline in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that attract drinks have fared the most in the same way that restaurants have done.
Pubs whose main revenue comes from food have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst at leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can’t be a worse time for food-loving businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over ?9 billion, an established industry benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep secret from their parents
One in five children aged just 11 has a secret social media account that they hide from parents and educators, research shows.
Research among 20,000 high school students shows rise in ‘fake Instagram pages’
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a “major” account that their parents know about.
One in five children, aged just 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” on which they shared photos.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that their parents know about, and they have a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the steering committee.
Doyle is the most award-winning lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport as those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that it will be of considerable benefit to athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be a real asset and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won four gold medals in total and is now a regular expert at the BBC, was unable to walk on the transient ischemic ata.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I’ve been able to make a full recovery, I’ve learned to walk again, and today I’m doing the exercises!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!”
Breast milk extractor that compares mothers to cows divides opinions online
The breast pump company has divided online opinion by advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of the “world’s first silent wearable breast pump”, the consumer technology company Envi has released an exaggerated music video showing the freedom that the new breast pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with the lyrics, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed I don't have udders, here are my boobs."
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my loved ones with milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“A very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth," one of the comments said.

Another comment: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “This ad is completely off the table.”
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "contagious."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's up to the point.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun ad targeting mothers who suck their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are all dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck their milk report feeling like cows.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and hides beautifully in the breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk when suctioning.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and milking cows, we wanted to highlight the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new sucker will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's hood has been in the limelight.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the catwalk, who was just using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially as the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of being threatened by the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Department, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for escort status for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed things up, asylum officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month before being detained, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many appear via videoconference calls instead of in person to declare their case a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, and report from the system over the past few months.
Advocates state that these concerns are heightened at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, although the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the acting prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "it will be treated accordingly."
"They must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the rally.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have rid the Syrian territories of” terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on war-torn territory.
Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have reached out to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help available for Syria to recover until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in Idlib's last refuge has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military intervention will target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front with ties to Al-Qaeda, who “will be exterminated.”
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition will soon take place to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against action.
Why Trump will win the second term
By this logic, Donald Trump would win the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the impeachment and scandals did not prematurely end his presidency.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidential term in history!"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue of the watchers.
Since 2014, viewership in prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased cable TV viewing to 3.5 million following major night news outlets.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the show’s “Designated Survivor” on ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and the show "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he’s funny,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the importance of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story set in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, so that immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“clothing arrogance” as reported by the Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Trump’s disgusting portrayal of “anatomy” by Stormy Daniel.
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the north bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outside money flows into the tightest home races of the mid-term election
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a cash flow due to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two office holders in a fight for the same seat.
This has recently led to the transformation of the suburban Pittsburg district by Conor Lamb, a district Democrat who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old precincts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a sharp financial spat between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the observed March special election to the 18th congressional district.
That seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight lead.
America considers fined El Salvador for backing China, then backs down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially evicted the organizing team of Trump's leadership.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a cut in financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal negotiations continued, North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any fines under consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the administration's signal for the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new intransigent news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from a special commission on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's exercise of the law, of which there is now much evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's investigation reportedly also turned to whether Mr. Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were to be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to declare himself accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to appear again before the voters, and in the end, probably, a jury composed of his colleagues would be waiting for him.
That’s a lot of “ifs,” and I don’t want to say that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all it took was for the Western powers to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the inexorable course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who runs Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had it rough since the news reported that he suggested secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a medical condition to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times versions are inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we be voting mid-term in Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will have a long dark night ahead.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on the Sabbath, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about clashing with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope of advancing from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance on the pitch in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could grab something, and we took away the point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it in the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we improved in the second half and we were better again.
Thursday will be another big night in Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last match they played a good result, but with the spectators behind me I am sure that we can push and it will turn out well.
Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it here.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, training is also good.
I hope we can put our backs on it now, put last season behind us and be successful.”
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it,” Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company, said in a statement.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes to them beforehand.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Call your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You can finance long-term care, for example, with a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help you pay for those expenses, or with your own self-insurance - as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles while you can.
Designate a health care representative, who will be a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and arrange for your accounts to be paid in case you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your grandparent is in dire need of a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“There’s more to the game than finances, for example, what are the doctors’ names?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready at hand.”
A man in Ilfracombe has been shot from an air rifle several times.
When the man returned home on foot after a night’s pull, he was hit by several shots from an air rifle.
The roughly 40-year-old victim was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with the death toll expected to rise further, according to authorities.
As the communications are out of service, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the Palu after the disaster broke out.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalu have been hit by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami also hit the west of Donggaly in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes occur regularly.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers Agency on Saturday, the 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
When, according to a police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "definitely innocent" when asked for a statement.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, by telephone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violating reports of domestic violence, and possession of a gun under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by war veteran groups when she linked her son's violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son's service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck directly at the shelling of part of Sulawesi island, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for death penalty for NYC terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - an exceptional sentence that has not been given for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan neighborhood in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep away pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries, the terms of the death penalty being defined by a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both figures would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including charges of murder in favor of extortion, which federal prosecutors routinely use in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” prosecutors say, describing the way Saipa’s act was carried out as heinous, cruel, and perverse.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed, having been proven conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
Police also said they had asked for the flag of the Islamic State to be hoisted in a hospital room.
He said he felt innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative Party conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has said that politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May’s own MPs, he should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would be “out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the issue that Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep schism, has been further highlighted by conservatives fighting to remain in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan running under the attacks of Brexit supporters, proponents of staying in the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to seek a deal with Brussels regardless of the consequences - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone announced that the group Leave Means Leave would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to ‘give up on the Chequers’.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in the lead, we’d be out today,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to bail on the Chequers.’
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to remain is completely misguided.’
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither our party members nor our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected will like it.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she says: 'Ministerial presidents will retain their place by keeping their promises.'
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an uncomfortable situation” if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we stand here today to tell them ‘we will not let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of a Brexit betrayal, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has secured us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud United Kingdom that governs itself.”
Proponents of remaining in the Union meanwhile marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit after the party's opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's application security issues after the conference opened.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to 'think carefully' about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which also means the woman at the top.
Suspect arrested in LSU shooting of Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday announced that they had apprehended a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released asking for identification of the man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was incompatible with life," Murphy Police Chief J. Paul said on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving at the scene, carrying a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was ousted without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6 foot and 6 inch tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title as team director hands him victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in qualifying on Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team director would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver made his way to the depot a lap later, and after the exit he joined Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward and in a close fight the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inside track free to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen set off from the back row of the riding field and was in the lead at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on a quick finish and be able to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually made it to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's rally for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and repulsive and lying."
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see those people, how angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
“If you look at the release and the publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
“No, no,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak occurred from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations or disclose information about the case," Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
But the president, who spoke at a rally on Saturday night, did not seem to believe her words: “I’ll tell you, this is really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, and hinted that Democrats were using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to stomp into the country to get back to power and to the helm.”
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars rectified Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a win in Saturday's rematch at Dundee, which finished 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-wicket lead thanks to hits from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowie managed to tie for home before Dwyer returned the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard then tied again for Dundee, whereupon Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two wickets secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday at Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous matches dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at a time of 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford credited himself with an assist on Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first period was wild when Sullivan got the home team back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cowie, who he compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the booths for the first break after all, in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to equal the goal from the power play in the time of 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later in the second period helped Nielsen move the lead to Dundee for the first time in the match, and the same player insured his team's lead in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic chief dies to allow hundreds of people on plane to escape earthquake
An air traffic manager in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died while overseeing the plane's safe takeoff with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake shook Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even as 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wildly tumbling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Juffri Airport in Pal.
He remained in position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped down from the control tower, thinking it was sliding.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands. The disaster management agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase as many bodies remain unsalvageable under the wreckage, and many of them have still not been reached by rescuers,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Pal reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings more bodies here every minute.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, telling the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks that are needed to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronesian islands in the Pacific, now said one person was missing, initially stating that all passengers and a crew of 47 people had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to locate one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to search for the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships assisted in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
“That was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others had managed to get deep into the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He further stated that the cabin crew panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby on the dock modifications helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network states that a total of 111 people have died in PNG plane crashes over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred to Air Niuguni.
An analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury outlined the scenario of how he used the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers' company the evening of her death, contradicting his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When mobile phone data showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he revealed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by police.
Sanford stood trial at the council and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis reported that he knew Chambers for about two weeks to the day she died.
However, mobile phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has shifted from its early days with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
New York City educator sues couple for firing after ‘racist’ text message
A New York-based educator is suing the couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneously sent text message from her mother, in which she was labeled as "another black woman" by the text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NO, OTHER BLACK,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Pi. Maurice.
When she understood her faux pas, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that just as she was leaving, her tutor, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired from their jobs and seeking $350 in damages for the day of the six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The pair, however, returned the punch saying they were not racists, but that terminating Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your child to someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “blackmail,” saying his wife cared for only a two-month-old child and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Would you drive someone like that?
That’s not a pretty thing at all,” the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit still stands, the social media jury very quickly convicted the pair for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington Bear stories feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, show latest news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, told reporters: “It’s hard to empathize with someone reading this for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s very funny to know now that we know the tremendous success of Paddington Bear.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, adding on the day of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet bitter" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, he was never boastful," she said.
But because Paddington was such a real person to him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with that look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all achievements only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nada saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
Medications given to her to keep her heart going slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything had closed down.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without showing what a severe trial she was going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“I kept my head down, tears streaming down my cheeks all the time.
It’s difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt overwhelming sympathy for Nado.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women send postcards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler Davis, was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the motionless body of his sibling after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how it's going to affect his life."
Ms. Davis designed the postcard to “inform people that they have people available who are willing to help and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit silently, you have to speak up.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is an old friend of Mrs. Davies', lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all,” she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Eve - when the children opened the presents, they didn't even look at them, nothing."
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they had to get over it gradually: “Such a thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something he was actually asking for - an investigation at a time of restriction, with a limited scope - we could bring some unity into it," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break up" because both sides would partisanally bury themselves in the conquered positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do poorly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to put the man they want on the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbied them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which was allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm in the Supreme Court.
North Korean Refugee Rates ‘Decreased’ Under Kim
Refugee numbers from North Korea to South Korea have fallen since Kim Jong-un’s government began seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 escapes in the past year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said it was due to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unfit for service on the Supreme Court" due to his temperament.
Pelosi made the remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman ever performed such a show, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both still in their teens.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also condemned Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" by liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements and by the way he leaned into the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded in the negative to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's dismissal if he were confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this - if he's not telling Congress the truth, then he's not only eligible to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential gains in the Judiciary at the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse some Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to just say, 'Oh, this is beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After months and years of grudges, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She continues: “I got a lot of help from a woman who worked as a director somewhere and who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but she developed a technique that means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my unspeakable anger with crying. But an older, always cold manager, whom I was always a little worried about, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever show them you’re crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an illegitimate affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn’t keep up with the donations, so she vowed not to get into the fight if she didn’t get $2 million in donations.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions - as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on the electors rather than the delegates, and out of anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating with rage.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they would write on my tombstone.
"Crying"?
Why China-U.S. Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the rift between the countries is beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most significant escalations have seen the light of day this week when new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods were announced, effectively taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the $60 billion in U.S. imports.
China has tried to return the same coin to the US, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy would kneel.
Even if China wanted Washington back on track, it would mean giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to American demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that quick policy decisions by Washington or Beijing could create the economic conditions that would trigger an economic backlash in both countries. This is far more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation on the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to a normal state.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now fulfilled, as well as unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still live in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe responds to Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost for the sixth consecutive time on European soil, thus failing to win the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tour, then batted the ball into the water for 3 pair of 16th holes and conceded a win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all his rounds and became one of 4 players and achieved a best result of 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the 5th and 4th lowest-rated European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently completed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned over his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I am happy to be able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend in an effort to find the fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I like these 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really have to take a leak.
You've played us."
Red Tide Update: Concentrations Decrease in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota Counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but there were relatively fewer spots last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, medium concentrations were reported off the coast or on the high seas near Pinellas County. In Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations were observed on the high seas, lowest to high concentrations in Manatee County, lowest to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas near Sarasota County, lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, lowest to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas near Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
