In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it is imperative that they arrive at their home.
Lamb vowed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts to the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter read.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
In the end, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details released by state-side investigators, as well as students and staff who knew him, collectively created the image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in thanking the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it came to problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, saying he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's staff recruitment meant that a doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be troubled by something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back into Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and witty person.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamba 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who tutored her on the guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls were broken as soon as he appeared,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River shoulder.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sparsely lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a sweat that Lamb had played to the guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything bad.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We played and recorded each other’s jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a slain professor, led the seminary in its first year and specialized in Native American and Colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended the candlelight commemoration event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reportage.
This story was adapted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us say they won’t hire as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the manufacturer of children’s toys and products says it will give current workers and seasonal workers the chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting candidates this month, and will add staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily recruit employees to help in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and I figured Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and I realize I'm within reach of what might be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the undisputed best travel documentary ever filmed for me."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands as if it were a bad joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they’re not succeeding (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously question what that means for the real estate tycoon’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made way for the rise of Herman Cain, ultimately not one of them winning a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Club for Growth economic conservative group are realizing Trump’s will to endure and are beginning to put their dollars on the line in order to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s assessment of favoritism was reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick in the early stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "indignant" about his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthusiastic" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if the favorite of the Jeb Bush venture became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to the idea that a real estate tycoon has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's vote by ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number holds true for the Iowa state senators' club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans had selected Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for eventual nomination by Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around a different candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct duel between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep an open backdoor for a change among candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration is still the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s hubris will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage will be done to the rebranding efforts.
But according to a new Monday ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain.
Frustration from the government reaches new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive roughly half the support from Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "damned angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state from coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government’s amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of income from surface mining fees from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that thanks to this they would receive additional money from the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The bill has been criticised by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from brown coal mining fees from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the previous 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals that companies will mine.
The change in mineral mining fees is to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets is to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million in fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from lignite mining.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments will continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government decree.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the setting of the fee may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Mládek, this is not a tax, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to the municipality and one-quarter to the state.
The same applies to the extraction of radioactive materials.
Part of the money that the state collects from mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The bill was criticised by opposition MPs, who said in particular that it would harm communities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just for the Minister of Finance to improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the increase in unemployment in Mostecko.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for further elaboration.
The explanatory memorandum states that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the prices of coal, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the increase in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in her opinion, the increase in fees is acceptable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decisions on coal mining limits before passing the law.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should not be taken until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Cheerful will lead the Czechs as the first, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to distribute the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so you can expect tough matches that can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to how it will look, Navrátil said during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raja Kumar Khanna.
With the number one team and the world forty Jiří Veselý, he counts on Friday and Sunday singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably spin in position two.
I want almost everyone to get involved.
“It’s in my head, but I’m not going to say it yet,” said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
The only question is who will stand next to the experienced doubles player who has an 18:4 record in the Davis Cup in doubles.
It's probably not funny.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know with whom or what it will look like," said Navratil.
It will be decided according to the development of doubles.
A variant may be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in the first round by winning in the doubles over the Australians.
“He’s decent,” he said.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I’d like to do the same performance I’ve done there since the second set.
"I am happy for this experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home team will take on Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he beat the players of the third and fourth hundred of the rankings.
The second is Somdev Devvarman (164).
They’re both challengers and ours have ATP Tour experience, but we’ve seen a lot of times that the Davis Cup rankings don’t make the difference.
"It's the momentary form, the weather," Navratil said.
Friday opening singles starts at 6:30 CEST and can stretch out due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it's supposed to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
It's already lit, and it's got, like, two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's PMQ debut has been eagerly awaited
Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut later, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theatre and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC's annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the newspaper's front pages.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economics, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the work also "gather" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn despite his position in the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a limit on benefits.
Hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party was "very clearly" opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from ?26,000 to ?23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that they are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "quick answers" to tooth trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, as he made it clear that he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted to failing.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photographers in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of ex-street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

Pounds rise as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB gains including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest pace since 2009 and it looked like estimates were coming up when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at ?1,3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close-up offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the world's two largest breweries, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest slump on the index and fell 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the firm to "sale."
JD Sports up 3.1% after sports firm reported an 83% jump in mid-year pre-tax profits of $46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The cost could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be built in close proximity to the Agnes Convent in the center of Prague.
The municipality stated in the decision that there was a violation of the Building Act, because not all the requirements of the zoning decision were respected.
"The territorial decision does not contain some elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and intelligible description of the shape of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the building," the decision reads.
The municipality also considers it illegal that some documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
For example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
The documentation shows that the owner of the land, however, only documented the consent to the project documentation for territorial proceedings, not the consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investment firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
Either way, this is a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions involved," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow due to the allegedly proposed colour of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Agnes Convent.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project has changed several times.
Based on the opinion of the National Heritage Institute, the Ministry of Culture rejected the original design of the 2008 project, which included a glass facade, and revoked the permission of Prague conservationists in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NPÚ and the municipal monuments and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections of opponents, saying that he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after pink-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician drove the migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, which they said they wanted to drive about half a kilometer.
At that time, it was not a crime in Hungary, he told the Lidové noviny newspaper.
We knew that law enforcement didn’t take such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the detention center in Szeged.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police officers behaved correctly, but were hampered by communication, because they did not speak English very well.
He said the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell measuring about three by four meters, there were 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up the next day, and because of the language barrier, no one knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers join with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
Losses in food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax returns, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will drop from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retail stores, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the change in speculation as sales and returns are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have switched to counterattacking and are investing more than $150 million a year to call counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price-fixing and retrofitting programs will catch on and hopes the wholesale will return to basic profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a collateral loss in the recent fuss over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, Tennis Australia president Steve Healy reports.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called the "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the umpire, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka had one to stretch to Kyrgios and I had to stretch to him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a convulsion thwarted his possible defeat of Richard Gasquet at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently based in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a placing in the second singles behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost due to a convulsion in the US, but he is not the first player to take his anger out on his racket because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he was very well-mannered, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He’s a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he’s never had a problem with other players, he’s very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he’s in amazing shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios over an important match that starts on Friday, stating that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he supports a Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around it," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, he's been growing fast in the public eye, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight where he can think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who tried to cross it illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in no-man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time on the belts of land between two states stand, those who flee from violence in their native countries, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants call together "Open the border!" and call the riot police Hungarian police.
Some people refuse food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just an indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a bloc of 28 states failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at an ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year that EU nations would take in more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not set its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence on the Serbian border is now being completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4 meter fence the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are absolutely clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defence adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 already in the country.
They have been penetrated by damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offenses under the new laws.
The authorities quickly repaired the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a barbed-wire tow truck.
Chaos arose at the main border crossing near Roszke, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was created.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked a major highway connecting Serbia and Hungary as they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds the double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main contests, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that they are clearly deciding which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choices than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton has maintained a large lead among women and is softening, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men decreased significantly, with Sanders only losing 5 points to her.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to her older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points behind her in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Unsurprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those that do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked on the open question of why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, a great possibility of election and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead the way - a third think he shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half cited Biden as their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second by far on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer problem solving to more chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of the three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have that opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are aligned with their ideological views.
In terms of all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, the majority of primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it did not affect their overall view of her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent have had their opinion of Clinton worsened.
More than 6 in 10 Republicans say their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don’t see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, many voters have not made an opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up behind Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson Gets Closer to Donald Trump in Latest CBS News/New York Times Survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, displacing Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is falling behind along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the walk with 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, showed Carson improving and reaching 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s upward trend, Trump decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blindly, even apologizing for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College First Year Student
Nearly two years after the student died during an overburdening fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Members of the fraternity of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and belatedly took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, was wearing a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the nation's president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the gear and essentially put the well-being of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's life," Chief Wagner said.
He was not revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object in the head, torso, and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternization overload, and at least one student has been dying each year from fraternization overload since 1970,” writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
Fraternity and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity severed its relationship with local branches.
This Is What Happens When the Fed Raises Interest Rates
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy specifically, the history of the small originator offers timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to the more common, but still low, will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for stocks to stop again 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a lag in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed increases.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so has often been the most - about 14 percent - headed for a rate hike in a fairly flat in 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returned to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4% on the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s chief equity strategist, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate-raising cycle and the return is starting to decline.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often help it.
At the moment, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could precipitate a recession.
The most notable is that gross domestic product near its lowest point in history at the Fed’s rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, GDP has only doubled in nominal terms year-on-year to below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to hold, when it was just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky, and the question could arise as to "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for Fed growth all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the upswing cycles so far have been in a super-leverage cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the onset of the recession very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we’re at 74 months and we’re still going on.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising rates will cause yields to converge between long- and short-dated bonds, which equalizes the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although “we are still cautious about yielding,” Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already aligned with Fed policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be bigger.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to outperform within three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Strong-balance-sheet firms outperformed weak-balance-sheet companies in every interest-rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "stupidity"
It is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and says they are simply cheating the British
MP Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says it's not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP and is accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be "stupid" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of when you're actually just mimicking what we already have on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director general dismissed the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, top notch.
"I also think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and launching new works is very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire due to stomping on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and came to the hearings of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated ?22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith aBoy George shine as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" the next time it launches an entertaining series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending royalties' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November’s Black Friday could be a reason for slowing spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain’s main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilizing online sales, and new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the start of the 2000 survey, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilizing online sales, and new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rate over the past few years and go all the way back to 2000, it’s always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
Now, however, it is stagnating somewhat, and therefore seems to be fading away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shopper turned to their computers to make purchases and knock down several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which allows shoppers to re-contract, may keep customers from making more purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only 1 in every 5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of crane fall in Mecca and Bin Laden family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were taken through the streets by Muslims at their first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose the path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen made their final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed by the holy place, where only a few days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and turned on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane fell at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that a hajj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman stated today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by a state-run Saudi news agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the crash.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's bosses were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims co-rge before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group made no statement about the collapse of the crane and were not made available to its representatives for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and of lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and they run major construction projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of an apostate who was disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred amid strong winds and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undergo at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals will be dedicated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B&Q CEO Says Eastern Europe’s Cheap Traders Are No Longer Trending
Britons increasingly employ artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix stores aimed at traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put away hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing artisans to do DIY work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home supply chain, says the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at merchants, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Today, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends, which depict more women's households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "Most of our stores are still staffed by men.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of their purchasing decisions.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher reported a slump in both mid-year profits and sales after the group took the cost of closing stores.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which is owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It's the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 vice-president Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of meritoriousness.
Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS MPs, noted that a one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to have it in standard valorisation, as it would also be reflected in the following years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be valorized beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
A higher valuation next year would have a budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorisation has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right’s veto will significantly complicate and possibly make it impossible to pay in December, he said.
The chair of the ČSSD MPs, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which was also blocked by the right.
The committee will have a month to do so instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money comes mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Pensions are expected to grow by an average of about a hundred crowns next year.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It can also be used by those who lost their pension entitlement in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued in January, namely by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Old-age pension expenditures accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
Last year, the average full-age pension increased by 104 to CZK 10,714, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned his plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire’s Senate seat was almost certain.
He was to represent the Kaliningrad Oblast in the Federation Council, whose governor, Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his position in Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names will be announced before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, the senator will be selected from the three candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, which is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.
Filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last straw in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided about her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová on a similar journey.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the previous one, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic way a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Still, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after an extended break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
I was surprised that he was an athlete.
Before filming, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode his bike, climbed the rocks and even walked up the hill.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heat, the director noted.
According to Bartoška, women marry a tiger in order to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll feed him a little, but they'll close the door so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to nurse her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan’s married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees pouring into Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charitable arm of the internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Telička's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Telička has postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday, after the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telička, this is due to an EP resolution last week criticizing human rights violations in Azerbaijan, of which Telička was a co-author.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive branch, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech News Agency (ČTK) clarified.
The EP resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent verdict against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadijah Ismail, who campaigned to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the possibility of building an air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We do not have such plans yet.
Nothing is impossible, he said.
Russia has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus, which until now has been used as a service and logistics center in Syria.
According to reports from the Russian press, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria has increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third phone call in ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to voice concerns about the build-up of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said Russia’s policy objectives in Syria were rather unclear.
Moscow has made Syria its own satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but that’s not entirely clear, Earnest said.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York, according to today’s speculations by the Russian press.
On the other hand, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report in The New York Times today, the U.S. government does not rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during a U.N. session.
Opinions among White House advisers have so far diverged.
TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the program of his New York stay.
Use sesame oil during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed from the seeds cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
These, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, have been the most frequent cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
They are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej z Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can squeeze 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
According to research conducted by Jarmila Hamerská at Masaryk University, 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it begins to burn out.
It is better to use it, for example, to season salads and it is especially useful in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all the fatty acids most reduce cholesterol.
When it comes to heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of fat and calories you consume.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to use extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts just like sesame and hemp for 9 months.
When stored in the refrigerator, the shelf life is extended.
Old oil is known mainly by its bitter taste.
There is no sluggishness at the bottom.
This is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Seeds of technical hemp belong to the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that it is one of the best-selling oils in Bohemia.
It is sold 500 litres a year.
People often take one spoonful in the morning.
Hemp oil is not distinctive in taste, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecuers are Americans.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
Various barbecue competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time retains healthy substances when grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should be saved fat.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose beneficial substances that we otherwise get from eating oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is called, experts from the company Bohemia Olej z Kraslice in the Sokolov region are immediately equipped with grape oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen is characterized by a unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this oil from vines, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also takes in important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
There are two ways to grill, the marinating and the grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing a marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acidity, for example, with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
Spices, in turn, give the meat a taste and the oil preserves and gives the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate through dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish is ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies especially to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grate with oil to prevent the food from burning.
An essential part of the barbecue is also the preparation of side dishes.
Grilled meat and fish are suitable for virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, Hot Summer salad.
For this you need: - 1 piece of peach - 1 bunch of arugula - 1 cup of chopped cucumber - 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves - 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add the chopped arugula, chopped cucumbers, and chopped peach to the salad bowl.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, and season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, sprinkle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple Sclerosis: It’s not just the drugs that matter, but the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social and legal counselling, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
Still, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more actively he fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors warn, the passivity of patients frees up space for disease activity.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time when a patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That’s why we created the website “Give Yourself a Chance” (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign “Give Yourself a Chance”.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, there is a saying that the sooner the disease is treated, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martina Kovari, the head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
Although people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, it manifests itself in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their confidence.
"Exercise also flushes out endorphins and one feels good after it," warns Dr. Kamila Řasová from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the University Hospital in Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called sparing, today we know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is that a person can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with occupational therapists to provide each person with a tailor-made compensatory aid.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a heavy load - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we are to go to someone, not to try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability it is possible to live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which no one can manufacture and process.
Yet, in addition to super-accurate, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as common as apricot pits.
In the drum, which resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are grinded in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has found anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in Prague Letňany, Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also allow passengers to enter the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world’s largest Airbus A380 airliner.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the moment keys are set by the company twice a year.
If there is no inspection record on the yellow sticker, they should explain at the Prague plant to auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who go regularly to check whether the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be manually tapped by the riveters.
It takes them two days.
Even from the sound of the hammer hitting, they will know whether the rivet is already properly tapped.
The tolerance in which they operate is minimal.
The rivet can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the check comes a trained touch.
When the controller runs his finger over a row of rivets, he will know if any is out of tolerance.
Then he picks up the exact dial.
Letov fed the program of the L-39 military trainer aircraft before 1989.
In 1991, not one was produced.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
At that time, it was joined by the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The Boeing deal wasn't that good.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry in 1999.
We talked about our relationship with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubský says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors were added for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these big jobs on our own.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of supplies for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any doors to aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that production processes meet customer requirements and in repeated inspections cost millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We have to retrain our employees, re-equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is completing the process of zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
They got the assignments from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll check out our lab.
They will test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, describing Dubský’s way of controlling them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant, the production of embraers is now standing and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he could ask for any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundred pieces produced.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will lose, Dubsky says.
Half of the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic riveting and door assembly line is being built for the A320 Neo.
Riveting will speed up and refine.
"This is the trend that assembly in aviation is taking," adds Dubský.
The future line is secured.
Airbus has ordered 3,278 A320s so far.
Just a few meters away there will be a line for the complete installation of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubský says.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company is also focused on the further development of composite materials production.
In addition to Boeing, it will also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company if it can process composites in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
Latecoere, however, is on the verge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the area of Letov where they are based.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and in three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are able to anticipate how many hundreds of new aircraft they order each year, they won’t have to worry about the job.
Despite having orders for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged some of their loans for shares.
Creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by raising capital by 57.4 million euros.
The debt of the company fell by two-thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has subscribed to existing shareholders for 222.9 million euros.
In total, the share capital increased by 280 million euros.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average order growth is expected to be 4% per year until 2017.
The order book is worth 2.6 billion euros, which is equivalent to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the gonorrhea.
The Czech race in Prague’s Letňany is important for groups.
16% of the group’s revenue.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The change in mineral mining fees is to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets is to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million in fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from lignite mining.
The amendment also envisages increasing the payment from mining areas to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments will continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government decree.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the setting of the fee may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Mládek, this is not a tax, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to the municipality and one-quarter to the state.
The same applies to the extraction of radioactive materials.
Part of the money that the state collects from mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The bill has been criticised by opposition MPs, who said it would harm mining communities and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just for the Minister of Finance to improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the increase in unemployment in Mostecko.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for further elaboration.
The explanatory memorandum states that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the prices of coal, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the increase in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in her opinion, the increase in fees is acceptable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decisions on coal mining limits before passing the law.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should not be taken until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain idle for some time, leaving interest rates between 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been a year since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy did relatively well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he could take it back, government authorities revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called police at around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send a policeman to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there was a “cute dog” in the house who “won’t annoy anyone” but was upset.
The police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, which read: “I am so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving a note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was obviously going on in Mr. Lamb's head".
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss's close friend, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would "not go to jail".
When police caught up with him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to the curriculum vitae he published on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things certainly take their toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for a minimum of six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless intervention in the 15th minute as the 20-year-old Shaw made his way into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be transported tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then further operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he plays again this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian umpire was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you to everyone for their messages, words can't express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."

The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture during a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Do you think David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a popular children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, such was the kind of thing I liked to read to my children, because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on an extract from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree," is the concise content of the book, which records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads as a summary of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that local nature is being devastated by the ravenous, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a stooped, mustached creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, a relatively minor PR task was given to a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was threatened by England's omission, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England have chosen for this tour, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat that they suffered last time in the test series.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup, and collective thinking is strong; they won’t bear the scars of 2012, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at trial series level, represents an offensive possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experience series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests faced two good attacks in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because - and I've mentioned this before - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not 100%, and I’m not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time a batsman gets to show up is a hard nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had a chance at home and away.
The only thing you can complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first - even though Lyth was at his best - but this missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and that's a batsman, which I rate very positively.
He’s the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 against us on the Trent Bridge pitch, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting with Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been floated and I have no objections to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't bat and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three to them and it makes no difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tries before his 2001 appearance.
He immediately succeeded for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he impressed me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I see that as a slug, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
There is a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, England seem to have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be harnessed.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy stagnates by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy of renegotiating Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble every day without electing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe in stride on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of Britain's self-centered agenda, divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George’s selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unbiased Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to the point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the too-long-continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Britons who could have invested their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they themselves do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 referendum in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Re-negotiations have solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
To their detriment, Europeans know how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the press oligarchs are to the EU, because they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, a conniving Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels correspondent for the "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free scoundrels, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-non-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same of them, but realized that when you’re in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn’t have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair conceded the principle of a rescinded EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a firing card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of adopting a strategy to boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock again, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC chair he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is evolving, I'll say it nicely.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory little Englanderism can certainly agree to this.
That's what Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on both radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benny's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the vortex, the breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal that is social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic truism about EU membership - in keeping with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his wringing about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Britain's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even at the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of something called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "bridge" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base" on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for BMJ challenged claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public could expect the PHE's claim, which reads "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, he states.
One of the 12 attendees at the meeting admitted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not funding they had allegedly received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industry funding in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report produced by this group "eloquently admits," the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim in the BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows and also what it does not portray, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS $2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC to quit EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop airing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs, which will likely be watched by only a handful of people, to difficult airing times over his rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House Communications Committee, as part of negotiations on the BBC's future.
If you keep licensing fees that I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least reduce the creation of programs that others don't produce or commission.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the broadest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, meaningless.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, the other channels would give you the right hand for them.
I don't understand how these are public service broadcasters.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those by former Sky executive, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more pampered public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they do exercise their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission of justifying '4bn of royalties revenue, "But of course we're doing all these obscure programs that nobody's looking at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's watching.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I would be surprised if they pay so much because they don’t watch the BBC so much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, speaking before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production had now been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take as a model public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the topic of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, of which only a handful were televised, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Record Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that inserts electrodes into a patient’s brain that stimulate the brain.
The nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Amplified ultrasonic waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which is found in the membranes of some worm cells.
With sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
However, Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be used in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements discrediting the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-gun market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Ties to the feet that break the ankles!
Blasting missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and metaphoric caricature leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the UK government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the International Veselice defence and security facilities at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with signs of the London Underground with DLR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR...Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group is helped to distribute throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is a $6 per piece Allen key that supposedly "gets access to roughly a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the commercial parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the gun trade health passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the gun trade ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "by adding bright colors and animation, we've made it appealing to more people."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty International.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not being illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on "the launch arm of the AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped headstock that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I bothered - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to dorms can range from mildly nerve-wracking to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath as well - ask and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Leave people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie nights, and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress up and edit their underwear.
Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship.
Introverts come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet many dormitories are transformed into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social, and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to go on, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One of the guys in my dorms used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to university at the height of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a plate of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
That is, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and lead are likely to interfere with others faking sleep when you try to knock on their doors.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a whole chicken is obviously a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn the drum and bass down a bit, because it was 3 a.m. and she had a test in the morning.
Their response was to strengthen the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, then played her own music aloud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook roommates for your future spouse, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends as well?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate isn't 100% your future spouse, try at least having a little chat with your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to a water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time during her pregnancy with today's seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was left alone to prepare and raise a child.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
With uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
Already then she met an elderly man on the Internet, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but he did not play the role of stepfather very much.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in It 3.
The motive of the third series of the Czech television series is precisely the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She managed to take care of Vítek and her family’s financial security thanks to part-time work and the great help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a strange child did not spoil Yourko’s affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Vítek’s second birthday and he now understands Vašek as his father and also addresses him as such.
Even though Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys paternity at the age of sixty and is also more devoted to children.
Besides Vítek, they were joined by a two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually also twins.
"Yours entered our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked to me much," Eva thinks.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, the mother usually spontaneously disappears after childbirth.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vaška’s happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vaška’s niece works, which managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting for the babies to arrive at Eve’s hospital did not make her happy.
"I was crazy to miss my husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the department of the six-year-old four-time mother.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by CT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be tamed.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with an electric double-plate and cramped conditions.
Although the house did not enlarge, Vašek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially the family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or tediousness of the house.
So far, we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and sometimes we cross the cuddled babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Your lighting job at the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That’s why he sometimes goes to Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he is able to take care of his family and children’s finances physically, but how long will that be?
"I realize that due to our age difference, one day I will be the one who will feed this family," Eva admits in an interview about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a big deal to employers.
And when the worst happens, my husband and I can take turns taking taxis, a blonde woman jokes.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all because of the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis, and a touch-recognition display are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend has been that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in weight to the disadvantage of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, and the larger one by 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets greatly troubled.
The chassis is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also projected on the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple uses 3D Touch technology to recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
Thus, the weight of the new iPhone displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone, it was originally 12 grams to 29 grams, and for a larger iPhone, it was 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest component to use.
The weight of just 143 grams is also achieved thanks to the slimming crust, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the case of a larger model, it is the heaviest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is seen in the display.
The weight of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As far as the new display technology is practical, it will only be visible during use.
The first users will be able to try it out on Friday, September 25, when sales of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the breakfast cereals been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian town of Grotta Paglici, archaeologists have managed to find something that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from various times, including wall paintings, tool remnants, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which according to the instruments is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that closely resembles the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today’s popular flakes.
In this case, the grains are soaked first, then dried, stripped of the packaging, so-called rinses, then steamed and spread flat.
In the Paglicci cave, it was possible to discover grains that were apparently heated or scorched, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists could not prove in their publication for the PNAS journal that the complete process of producing flakes was taking place in the cave, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid, and quite possibly warm, is, of course, offered quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Brno City Transport Company.
So once again I listened to the reports of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přívrak, Phrasova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the message in the male voice was a bit less understandable than before when the stops were reported in the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different than in the noise of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for several decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, may be confused and may at the final, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were supposed to get off was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better again announcer - should be made again, and this time colored by the usual traffic noise and the roar of the engine, in which the knuckles of the speaker in the bus are almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or then Podorná in a creaking shawl, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old-timer's hearing didn't suddenly deteriorate so much during the one day that the announcer of the stops changed.
Before that day, I understood the report pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track record.
Today, few people know what were the biggest and smartest so-called comprehensive reviews under the party government.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher’s office the moment the radio said it was seven o’clock.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into Comrade Chief, he came a minute ahead of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," remarked the dispatcher as I was writing down the arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going to the precincts for a minor mechanization review.
I can't do that. There's a background check today.
They're all fucked up, it's horrible.
What's going on?
“You’ll see,” the dispatcher sneered.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, sir," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I hurried to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man had answered.
"You're playing games," said engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I greatly esteemed.
She was even the chieftain before she was deposed by her comrades.
There are clearances, and you'll be here in no time.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they have to do it once every three years, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
They say I'll see.
I pulled a periodic report file out of the drawer, and then I got a phone call.
“Come here, Holcman,” said the chief’s voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, each with only his thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I have come upon your order," I checked in, barely entering the Chief's quarters.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked at some paper.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the paper on the table, leaned into the back of the chair, and stared at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I wasn't sure.
What's going on?
Just yesterday, the deputy praised that I had worked very well in my job during those few months and that he was extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician, and that's what you need to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I had used such a greeting since childhood, that I had been so brought up and that I did not see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job."
Plus, you're still confusing calling your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade."
But I'm not a chief to you, I'm a chief comrade.
The deputies are comrades, the chief trackmasters are comrades, chief trackmasters!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with the usual civil salute.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor work, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief coldly, who had meanwhile calmed down a little.
We'll talk about that later.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a retirement plan for that chair up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it did not look good with the person in question.
He gave me a cold, prickly look for a moment, and I looked for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched chatter.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing God.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as it was convenient for him at the moment.
He's been kicked out.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the party members, but also non-party members, appealed to him.
But the chief addressed many, especially those to whom he could assert his superiority.
He just wiped me out for complete bullshit.
I thought about my ass, and it cost me enough to fight it off not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the pickaxe, let alone continue as a railway official.
How would I feed two kids?
And a built-up house!
It made me cry, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," said the chief, and began to look carefully at the paper he had in his hand.
At half past twelve I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions of what and how, they answered that yes, it would be good.
Only Jožin bitterly said, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because Comrade Chief would have to do the work alone with his faithful, and that he did not threaten.
The word "comrade" was emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had wiped me out for in the morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long consultative table other comrades who were to decide my official existence or non-existence.
Kádrovák, president of the ROH, staff writer, special-purpose officer, something of a countermeasure in the military, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
An ordinary trackworker, he would pick up sleepers or throw gravel with pitchforks.
But also an ex-con.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, apparently a nice beast.
Bad languages claimed that the school came out in the seventh grade, did not learn anything, did not know anything.
And when the crime scene was canceled, he ended up on the gravel by the pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief asked me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unswallowed donut in my throat.
Kádrovák read the report from the civic committee from his place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, I have two children and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then the opinion of the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the civic committee, perhaps they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents, long-time members of the party, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The doctor noticed and stopped reading.
The chief told him to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM, and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides being on the National Committee, I also had a wedding in the church.
I've let down the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I've been removed from the list of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both of my children baptized, and even had a church funeral for my mother when she died, even though she was a former party member.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre finished reading, only the chief’s pencil tapping into the table top interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to fix the switches without a fucking check.
But now?
She took her career as a railway official before she started.
Return to Platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade here?" the chief interrupted with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to a previous job report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, there were no doubles.
On the covers of a drop of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he himself had been checked.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of judiciousness, which, however, was often the harbinger of the storm.
At first glance, full of praise, he was taught with distinction, graduated from industrial studies, worked as a locksmith in a task-based salary, and met the standard at an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get the report from, comrade?" he turned again to the cadre, who felt that somehow it was beginning to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be cadre.
Comrade here gave it to me on arrival.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the precinct to the platoon," bleaked the cadre.
And there are no testimonials required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were in the technical position, this piece of paper was enough for you," said the chief.
He blinked nervously and had no answer.
"That's okay, we'll discuss it later," the chief concluded, apparently relieved by the cadre.
He's held up for now.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly he's kicking me out, so that's it!
My eyes were darkened, and I felt the heat.
A flood of reproaches and accusations followed, and I knew that I was the most abominable creature in the world that did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That I had misled a fellow staff officer by insinuating an incomplete opinion, while I did not understand why the opinion was incomplete when I received it from the staff officer in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element which, at the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in the realms of religious obscurity.
That, there was a lot I did, or maybe I still do, and I prayed silently that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the Comrade Chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman suddenly said, forcefully cutting off the chief's levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, stupid!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close his side door for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so readable or parroting phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty, indeed, to support this young, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty, which no one can relieve you of!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the president was finished, no one heard.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said icyly in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was coming to.
Everyone nodded in agreement, but they could see that they didn’t believe a word he said.
"So I was confirmed as an independent care officer for basic resources," I groaned as I returned to the office, and then cried.
Except for the engineer Eva, they were all at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent account of the fresh experience, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about cadre practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, is given to a man, and the other, in which there is any filth, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn’t end up where I should, but on the gravel by the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn’t know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink, and so it turned out how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old man," she remarked mischievously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Watch out for him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The water on the coffee started to boil, and then the office was filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a lump of sugar into the cup and silently stirred the hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
I'm not getting fired now, and there's more vetting in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't let me forget today.
Published in an anthology LITERÁTI NA TRATI II. by EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People from all over the place call it the "windmill on Chlum".
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the village received on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the vicinity," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a memento of the present: it is reminiscent of the time when local people were fighting for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided for the solution, which was then suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch to Číchov they had dug a seven-meter deep well.
Three years later, they completed the well with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě at a cost of CZK 2,400," the memorial inscription on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure reads.
The pump, after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, expired in 1971.
On 7 May 1973 a new chapter of the struggle for water began: on that day a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and local rarity.
The dominance was put into operation at this year's gathering of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumští decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but the same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material and the bike could not resist the gusts of wind.
After that, the Chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
Since June this year, however, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives, the village had the replica of the bike modified and re-installed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only to the overflow blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely unplugged it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned out empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the windmill shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," the mayor explained.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has become a municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the entire Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the Přerov region or in the Police in the Vsetín region.
Nothing bad, but I don't know Lafata, admitted the Tripoli Goian support.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us back then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only this time we won’t lose,” Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is the key support for the Greek team.
As a stopwatch, he will face incursions from the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the spartan Hybsh about the Greek duel.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know very well Fatai, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their games at the time.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name the other players of the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he also knows David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and with a slightly reproachful look aimed at Czech journalists.
The expression on his face meant, “Why are you asking me that?”
After a moment of silence, he started.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teams.
He has really good players.
And Lafat?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else besides Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, we can say that he is holding the defense of Asteras, he is such an organizer of the game," noted the Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football biography.
At one time Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this match, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
“Like Sparta, we will try to win,” Goian said.
I am in a room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But on behalf of the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the company’s affairs, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the Group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
To enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing a prospectus for the security, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the registered office of the holding company and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders taking part in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so choose - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has said in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of news coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the main news channel of the Czech Television.
And how did she survive?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's broadcasts of Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news broadcasts were devoted to the migrant crisis.
Until the first minute, when the Czech Television reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and euphemistically called the attacks of migrants on the police, they had euphemistically run out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda had already gone - judge for yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
The Czech Television consistently uses the terms refugee and not migrant.
What is particularly striking is the fact that the Czech Television consistently uses only images of young children and women in illustrative shots.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unprecedented from communist agitators.
As a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once upon a time, when I moved into a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I had fish in the bathroom.
Domestic fish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing that transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle and a chick looks like an adult individual, only it is tiny and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't laze around to kill them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided a kind of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenileizer, which the ants brought to the nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I took a turn.
As time went on, insects became an object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and can replace one pest with another.
The truth about fleas and bedbugs is that I wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish do not crawl around our necks, they should eat flakes of sagging skin, some invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider.
It was a common type of nomad who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived off of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us feel more comfortable.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that he probably kept their number on a bearable numerical state.
By confidential regular contact with each need we found out that it is a female.
For we have seen romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully strumming on the web threads so that he is not eaten before he reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, and they fled elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she left or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet dweller.
For some time she carefully observed our behavior from the ceiling and, moving under the toilet bowl, assessed our non-aggression as friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fishponds decreased again, and the spider calmly observed its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed in a year.
In the meantime, our daughter has reached the age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring out of its contents has been eating away at us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her bad habit in that spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, the luck in the house was not at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
There was no need.
There was a time when the spider had to command itself, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished across the balcony to somewhere in the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but still, after living together for so long, I felt like I was throwing away a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
Wonder the world, a week, two, none of us showed up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider, like the ants, had somehow grown up there, that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they swarmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found out that their attachment to the spider must have had a reason for not seeing it, that it was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator, and its rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarm reaction in them.
All the more so since I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light shyness, but that they would respond to waving hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract another spider.
I'm already sending my wish on the air and I hope they didn't let me down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Zyklon B.
Ten Quotes by Albert Einstein that Made the World Rich.
The words of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deep into everything that the result was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He came to the attention of people mainly with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
Nor can we forget his explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that for a closer acquaintance they prefer easy proportions.
However, it is not easy.
But it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: An hour near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire array of famous quotations these ten, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right.
But only one can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy a prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what will be fought in the third world war, but in the fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much is dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not mentioning Einstein’s formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are in black numbers this year," said the governor Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities is currently about CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kromeriz, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this is the reason why constructions are moving towards the total cost of almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of time when we were mainly buying equipment is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top healthcare cannot be done, explained Lubomír Nečas, the regional deputy health minister.
We are looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will be coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetín, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now being selected for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kromeriz, they have an extension of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new intern to this year’s central pavilion for about 200 million.
And the Baťa hospital in Zlín is waiting for a long-delayed construction of a new central income and intern, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
These are all major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, the hospital's director.
The five-storey building is to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be significantly recognized by patients, will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, beds are non-adjustable, windows are leaking and medical staff do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of its life," said the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model has half finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing and will be added to it within three years.
"We will pay the construction out of credit and partly out of our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and it did not get into the loss even two years ago, when the Zlín hospital was struggling with a loss of almost 200 million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively managing costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the Kromeriz hospital are also expected to improve.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion Czech crowns will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention station will be completed, then the extension of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live here anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the European Union's interior and foreign ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive a reply, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year now, and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
A few years ago we were talking about $40,000, now we are talking about $120,000.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don’t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, get asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don’t even want to come to us, but fifteen hundred people have already committed to us.
Could there be more to take this route?
We're committed to hiring 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We used to say: hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1500, the point is that 1,100 people will come with us to handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same as the ones we intercepted.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that, if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that does not yet exist, it may happen that we will not keep even the 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will go back to Germany when they arrive.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of European statistics say they receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who are going to relocate.
This is the second project that has been going on so far, and we have only progressed there by discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic is only rejecting quotas, but is not offering any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
What exactly do you think is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says that all migrants from Syria can join them, the news will spread in the order of hours throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they just don’t want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Make it clear that they don’t have a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, prosecutors.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or receive them only according to the needs of economies, then the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic has jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far will it go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of being captured by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it is complicated and the Greeks - this is a completely useless story.
So where's the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, they're going to exhaust our capacity so much that we're going to have crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation should arise, the government can sit down de facto immediately, and one resolution would decide to strengthen the police by an army, let’s say a customs administration, or a prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarmist information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
They are trying to prevent a declaration of bankruptcy.
Football has paid off its debts.
Footballers have their money too.
Slavia was brought to court for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after it was proposed by Online Services in Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Slavia attorney Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
Needless to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC became the new owner of Slavia, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns on Monday, just the day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," attorney Slavie Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan and the Czech midfielder Maria Liček.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid the dues of the Prague 10 district.
Thus, only claims that Slavie disputes remain de facto part of the insolvency dispute.
Either according to the club, the obligations were not created at all, or there are lawsuits about them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove by an account statement," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," Mládková said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities are outstanding.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the said debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to continue on November 3.
The decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

Blanka could be built so that she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been beaten even more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built in such a way that there were no two sinks in Prague’s Stromovka, says production director of Satra, Alexandr Butovič, who is the main designer of the tunnel.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
It would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The driver will open on Saturday afternoon.
There is always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel could have been driven more safely, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, but the country fell only a few steps from where it began to use a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Two times, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
The original plan was to cost 17 billion crowns.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, out of seventeen billion you have twenty-one.
Adding technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, said Bělohlav.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx Mixed Profits, Lowering Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its year-round profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx said it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher surcharges for the overland transport of heavy or large packages, which start in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO of the company Fred Smith said the company "performed solidly despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, as forecasted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
Land revenue increased by 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher incomes due to higher base rates, while profit fell in freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a fall of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week seated at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping local prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch when weaning off an unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate on-site since late 2008.
Although most data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed by adding to volatility by raising its federal funds reference rate - no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait any longer," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with the key indicator only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the slump with the promise that further increases are not in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would hold rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he said.
If the Fed’s politicians did this, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold hands with the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise its rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that despite spring and early summer, she expects rates to rise this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake up late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record value in May, as investors worried that China’s slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now only losing nearly 10% of its May high.
The Fed’s uneasy market situation provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would have been tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA's Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank’s influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "pin" their monetary expansion in the market has triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc's global wealth-management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting policy-making member of the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "despite limited identifiable impacts on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rate increases because markets have become angry," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be on the cutting edge.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market/warehouse is the only point of contact offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you’re hungry, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various collection points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of the items are sold in bulk.
Limit fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as separate families and individuals.
Wide aisles accommodate shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Found: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Located: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, surrounding a suburb of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was denied by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House passed an amendment to the Senate that rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the President.
Czech President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto a law that would allow 100km of speed.
Transport Minister Dan ’ok (for ANO) also opposed the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, the Senate passed the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be used in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also excluded from the amendment the right of the traffic police to have the last word in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which has been approved by the House, also envisages that sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally below the road surface.
Municipalities would save money by buying land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that owners do not report to.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which their owners will not register within six months after notification of towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on second and third class roads under penalty of fines for forwarding companies.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic vignettes instead of the existing paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí exponent goes to court.
He faces 10 years in prison for greeting people.
The case concerns an allegedly overpriced project of welcoming citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not hand her over.
According to the legal classification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
Former members of the city management, according to the prosecutor, illegally allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company, which organized the welcoming of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipal department of urban services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company entered the competition, offering the lowest price, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to an administrator and only the company Darothore applied for the competition, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges, led by the aim of securing for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organization of the event Welcome Citizens in Ústí nad Labem, have acted in a long-term and coordinated manner least in violation of the requirement to proceed with due diligence, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of Citizens event, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandík has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have committed no crime, I am innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, said the former mayor, adding that the city under his leadership only followed a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organized by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals originally wanted to accuse Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
The House did not prosecute her.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to blame Kailova after her parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcoming of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released a dog on the fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete the footage of a police dog allegedly hitting a refugee.
But the Hungarian government has questioned the allegations.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Roszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees, and one of them had a dog attack a Syrian with a basket on its nose.
The dog of the man who yelled "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," collapsed, Muzi claims.
One of the police officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
He was then ordered to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi’s account of the events.
He said the police only wanted the journalist to show them if they were in some of the shots, which they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare and scare a bit, but they don't attack with certainty," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
City wins, believes Juventus
“It’s disappointing, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” said Manuel Pellegrini, the City coach.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on our feet longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team scored 636 minutes in the competition.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as a defender of the title and with a score of 2-4 he is only in 16th place of the table.
That’s why the turn at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will give us a kick," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester they were represented by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is extremely important, hopefully thanks to it we will ride the winning wave," hopes Morata.
Because when we are on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
My players deserve this result.
"Before our goal, we could have scored 0-2, but Gianluigi supported us," said Allegri coach Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," lamented Yayu Touré, City's midfielder.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Farewell Angelo, farewell old Germany II.
Before we proceed with the question of immigrants, we should remember that the whole media frenzy around us is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children carrying their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically causes a feeling of guilt and compassion in the person - that is, in the European person.
Well, they come here not only desperate children, notice the pictures of the landing boats to the Greek islands, that the children are not so much visible on them!
And somehow, recently, pictures of boats heading for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie on beautiful promenades, have disappeared from our television.
Mostly young blacks.
And also the pictures from Callais disappeared, where these eaten and black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's moving on.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, he is somehow hiding that they are not only unhappy children from Syria, but also well-dressed - for the elderly: fashionably fancy - young men.
Their muscles look as if they have just come out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Aged between 15 and 30.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In their hands, of course, smartphones.
The fact that it was a private beach did not interest them, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've taken all the deckchairs.
Those who did not lie on it and were just in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like American rappers.
On the heads of the cap with a nail, white and colored sneakers on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They occupied tables around, crammed themselves next to the sitting dark and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were running away from the dining terrace.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from the thirds - how in the series from the USA?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around.
They kept shouting loudly at each other.
But it was not English.
Then they drank the wine, also straight out of the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - screamed and screamed in the water, mothers with children and pensioners ran away in horror, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They've all disappeared.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about it.
The waiter said to me in a low voice, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them was wearing a 20-centimeter gold cross around his neck.
And women were like jewellers.
"Are they drug smugglers?" he asked.
"You saw them drinking," replied the waiter.
Drugs are not smuggled or used.
They're smuggling something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important for me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million migrants were sent to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and their associated lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognised main force in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not only them, but also the top of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the August 1968 Moscow TV pictures.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the railway station, but most importantly - Old German - Muslims welcomed their fellow countrymen.
For weeks they were babbling in the news on Czech Television, as according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But those who have been in Germany only a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
This was also reported by our television.
However, they hid what broke the next day in Germany: that in the poll for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the poll was attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: "Our pursuit of 'multi-cult' society has completely failed."
She went on to say, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All attempts at such cohabitation have completely failed."
In a country of four million Muslims, the strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without being integrated has not worked out. Today they live here with us, and we have been deluding ourselves for some time that they will not stay, that they will disappear again one day.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, where we tell ourselves that we simply live happily side by side, has failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the warden in a concentration camp from the minute - has, as he has already demonstrated many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who, for years, tried, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past as aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Grand Germans to dominate the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After an attempt by Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Faction, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We'd say sunny.
The German elites had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, so they left all those anti-atom fighters alone, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they fully sided with the fighters against warming the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream considering all Slavs to be difficult to recruit - since the times of Karl Marx, who, after his Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And, as the latest statements of Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be obeyed without excuse.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we add in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German, which suits and which benefits from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-villainism of the sun-bearers first led the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multi-culturalism, and today it has brought home millions of Muslims.
Those who, lured by the sirens’ voices, will soon run into a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and they will start to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, once again a part of its population - but it seems that a smaller part - will ideologically go astray, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Is Germany going to burn again?
Muslim homes are on fire.
What will the German government do when there are public protests by Germans against the invading Islamists?
Who will be helped by Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, invading Islamists, and Germans fear the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when the people who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superman Muslim rise up?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that it has created in Europe by supporting the ideology of the sun, that is, the ideology of the elitist and, in principle, totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the rude treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot turn out well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy salespeople is to scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy knock will come down on you in a way that the weaker nature may not just stand.
You will be guided to the right path, and the right path will lead you to the right path, and the right path will lead you to the right path.
It may be a pity that a talking knocker can not be bought in reality.
It would be nice if we could get rid of a lot of snoops and scumbags.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to the expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's inscrutable, she's doing well in our garden.
It likes a drier environment, it is easy to adapt, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and photographing it further.
Beneath the detail is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding using pictures of babies sucking from breast-painted images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their babies and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show
The flight of Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the liberal leadership leak failed to produce a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Morning show Nine screened from National Capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV didn’t seem to care much about this tyranny of distance, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has filled the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, it was an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was a stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor by Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which featured Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
With The Chase Australia's second night ratings down, Nine will be confident that Hot Seat will finally win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

The three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes upon Bachelor is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who stay won't reveal who the real one is who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's finale
All three women lyrically sang about why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so throughout the course," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's just the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her part, she claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my heart to him."
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snow and Lana indecisively.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams questioned after his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by an Australian rugby league convert on the first kickout of the pitch in Tuesday's 20:3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after injuring Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be candid in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers' reporter, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only worry about the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after an error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career he could not have imagined.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to a Queensland three.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointing pistols at a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The ÚS defended the emigrants, who demanded compensation for their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a claim for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim by awarding them only less than CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
Emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and added to the amount originally sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the ÚS with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even though it represented a compensation adequate in relation to the real estate taken away - today reaches only a fraction of the value of the real estate.
"This cannot be a burden on secondary participants as a restitution of entitled persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," said the judge, rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The Constitutional Court has repeatedly advocated that the ordinary courts should proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the redress of property grievances caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita will now be played by Radka Fišarová in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita when she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague in 1998.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's intensity has not equaled much of the show."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
The role of the first lady of Argentina was recommended by Monika Absolonová.
I have seen Moncha three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly I saw a completely new concept.
I am a big fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is just especially good.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, light and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The musical sceptre between the two singers will be handed over at Monika Absolonová’s Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
They will be performing the duet Don’t Cry for Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also step away from the director’s desk when he will represent the role of President Perón during the filming of Karel Roden’s film.
Due to the interest of the public, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
The main female role was originally directed by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden appears alongside her as President Perón and as Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Marek, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and softened their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group calling for the establishment of their own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Legislators this week in Kathmandu voted to establish a draft constitution, and officials state that a new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov, you did not manage even a home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Are you not afraid of such a disastrous entry into the Extraliga as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states as they flee war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this in a very unusual way on their blog.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the news on her blog based on her personal experience as a seven-year-old refugee from Kabul with her family.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But as Europe’s migrant crisis worsens, more and more families are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said that all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, with the largest number coming from Syria, which has driven 4 million people out of the country this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For Slightly Obese Diabetics, Weight Loss Surgery Could Be Useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are provided with non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality data takes a long time to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on a new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight to height, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicate an overweight person, and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in the treatment of type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the body’s ongoing blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers said.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treated group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" -- which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels -- did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1), and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a decrease in a patient’s BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to show people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush following the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, advising him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who ingested the sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested high-alcohol sanitizer, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of ingestion of sanitary products in children under 12 years of age that were reported to the poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitizer intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitary ware because of a cheap fuss.
The teens reportedly mixed a sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the remedy.
"The kids don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitary means) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very tempting for children.
Sanitation contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few curls can mean alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s Toxicology Control Center.
You wouldn’t leave a glass of whiskey lying around, either, but people leave these sanitizers outside, and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four lobes of sanitizer with the smell of strawberry and was taken for treatment to the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who looked after her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could be deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitation to be out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitation product that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and has banned their presence in the room.
The police considered the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No disagreement in Celtic team
Griffiths downplays the talk of disharmony in Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will battle the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Denies Disagreement
This situation has sparked rumors of inconsistency in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we’re feeling the pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them for the title anymore.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, states: "They no longer show the best of Celtic's matches in the Netherlands, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
I'll turn things around for good, Deila pledges.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic is a bit stumbling, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around for good.
The defeat by Malm and the following dropout from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has had bad times before and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what’s going on.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because they make the players so much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about a large buyout of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
Brentford's former boss states, "January's transfer window is very different from that of summer."
Players who arrive in the summer have a whole pre-season period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Micha's transfer goal suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has been struggling with a prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on that defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the umpire Collum that was withdrawn.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a high point," he said, adding: "I can safely say I will not return to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic's jersey."
Council at Tannadice believes in Dundee United's management - Donnelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in correcting the situation by currently managing the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes likes 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold out desperately against the Hamilton Accies in order to get their seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half played by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states, "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as total UK unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UK rate (5.5%), as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, the number of workers now halted to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has been rising while unemployment has been falling.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary and I'll see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I begin to fear it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and forge a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one and a half hour visits.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist at the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I will not repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after extricating the man from Canning River.
A man's bet from Petrh to escape the police did not come out after he got into shallow muddy water only meters away from a police officer who tried to non-violently persuade him to return to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident extending into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by evading across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come and get me,'" Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn’t want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, namely police negotiations.”
"People sometimes try to do funny things while running away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and attempted to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratching of Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidar's positive swab on cobalt that he cannot explain.
He bit his tongue on espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bombshell in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department had attempted to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name after a question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about things being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they have completely failed.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it even today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make people outside of coaching positions take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them something to think about.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and burden them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch made him feel that he "could clock his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "ridiculous" after clay compress or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility,” he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment of compresses on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who escaped was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie himself confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm head coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by the two NRL favourites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the team's controversial victory of the Storm in the final of the qualifiers in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on the Strorm after his team won the final of the qualifiers over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game as a "show" of the rugby league and according to him the two of Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions, saying they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has raised his self-esteem as his team is criticized by two senior coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing to Team Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we have only put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and this has meant a turning point for us.
Trent has been here for three years and is obviously coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like this always come up in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours and just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 they were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds cancelling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that type of player.
He said this opinion in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting into the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I wasn't watching, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think these are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at some stage.
The Storm are taking a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine who was smuggled out of Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drug from a Solay yacht that arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the jointly accused in the harbor during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possessing commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovice's lawyer put up a defense on the grounds that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe quite by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather jointly offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 bail deposited is a real financial burden on them," Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and abide by the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that her phone was missing and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before alerting her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "disturbing" search on the web using terms to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "guide the pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer and spooking them."
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admits that he did the computer search, but claims that he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, it was to lure them
He claims to have gone crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw obscene pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to bringing an action for accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14, breaching bail conditions on January 25, and failing to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on a list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no substantial sexual overtones in his act."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October due to reports from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody prior to hearing about the other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders list before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes poor speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to hinder Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear but is named 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "concerns" over threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is planning to cut the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolished 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services to the enterprise.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing business hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing unmatched integrated technology solutions” to companies.
This will break up the company that was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in the industry based on the belief that a highly specialized company is performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilsher ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
The big shame of this most recent issue is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to his former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't jeopardize a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition,” Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also undefeated in a total of 41 games after retaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by a 3.2 degree Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
That was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season’s Champions League capitulation to Monaco, and he is left with no hope of leading the club to its first European Cup win.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
This never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions on various shows is glaring, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address this issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose goal is to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of experiencing mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun-loving, and more successful, even when we are in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire game creator recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
For him, the beauty of Friends was the source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifices, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, although they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, “my role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the status of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So if you’re going to the Comedy Central’s FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned to celebrate.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG defeat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malm at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions after winning, but then threw away several chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn’t the classic performance of Laurent Blanc’s team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of the goal and was later substituted against his home team and the club where he started his famous career in 1999.
“In the Champions League, it’s not easy to win at home or at home, so winning 2-0 is a challenge for our opponents and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even if there are things we’ll need to improve as the season progresses,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which home scored this weekend a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing was marked as the man who took PSG to a new level in Europe after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran on Marco Verratti's pass for defending Malm and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to kick off a spectacular victory for PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, started with 9 Internationals in the basic lineup and five defenders and two drawn midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which only narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's far corner goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG were depriving themselves of the benefit of the attack with bad passes and a crappy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to fire even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended up in Wiland's wicket after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This put an end to all Malm's thoughts on the possibility of making a profit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent intervention from a great distance thwarted David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi at the end of the match was unrecognized.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor stated, "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Stock Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by a collapse in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan on Wednesday.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about $1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with a tumult in commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown reduces demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore stock prices to the top on the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about a prolonged slowdown in China’s growth have halved the price of iron ore, and coal, copper, and other commodities have plummeted by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his consort Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations and encourages cooperation on issues of international, regional and common interest, and provides an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for a September U.N. meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber-espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis destroyed the Schengen area.
An emergency flare detonated by Germany has far from cemented the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French newspaper Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum-seekers once they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece - rather than argue over the future distribution of refugees by quota based on the amount that is increasingly drifting away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 out of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, EU interior ministers have changed their priority.
Before caring about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text said.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU is finding itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing the pressure.
It reinstates border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that, without it, no free movement is possible in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but also sees blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maiziere discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with their fingerprints taken.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others that camps will not remain on its shoulders in which refugees would accumulate at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and is waiting for a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and the source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission has promised to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European border control agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its reception capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
In any case, the new emergency situation of the 28 has pushed back the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was already raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed on in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under avalanche in Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to authorities, the German woman is also the only survivor of the eight-member group affected.
Previous media reports said she was Polish.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious injury to her leg.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been taken to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The disaster happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4,015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, head of emergency services.
According to him, a huge amount of snow was pouring on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: The real Europe at last.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský during his debut in the cups managed to go through the preliminary stages of the Europa League to the basic group with the Liberec footballers and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
At the beginning of the main stage of the competition, Slovan will welcome the finalist from 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, he wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to your dream group, now we’re there and we’re going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every goal, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by a double match.
"I'm very much looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was only a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
Braga is a top team.
He will be very active, they have all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be even more difficult because he does not have such a name, but he has a player in his squad, who I think gave Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent team at the top level," Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't see Braga as a clear favorite.
We play at home, so we’re not outsiders.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from eleven games this season.
He believes that even Braze can impose his style.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, but at the same time is unusually disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will perform on the field," Trpišovský said.
In the preliminary rounds we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted to training.
"And we definitely want, although it will be very difficult, to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films dominate Pisek, the international festival begins.
This year, over 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by a committee composed of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year, the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival theme.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year’s gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student films - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbo band Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Život na baru.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first one will be brought by Jana Asenbrennerová, a graduate of the Písek Film School and winner of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will bring closer the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the Písek natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop common ties and filmmaking," the spokesman said.
Pitching forum, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time and get a job.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in Písek.
Its founders, Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth grade.
In the event of bankruptcy, the insurance companies are to cover the claims of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
This was decided on Wednesday by the House when it approved an amended amendment to the Tourism Business Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is to be assessed by the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay their clients’ claims above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against the crash when the amendment comes into force.
Travel agencies have also criticised the proposal.
Without insurance, they will have to leave or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouska’s concerns on the basis of a survey among the CC members.
“Stop lobbying insurance companies,” he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, there is no official written statement to this effect.
However, they are trying to find out whether the travel agencies will be complicit, which is not a problem, according to Okamura.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about erasing stairs for Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Fischer said.
Her motion to dismiss the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) also failed with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip pointed to travel agencies, which he said could be a threat to consumers.
The draftsman Martina Berdychová (ANO) withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum limit of four million for travel agencies offering air travel, and a limit of one million for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30% of planned sales.
However, the limit of insurance payments will have to be such that in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all the claims of the customers.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to indicate which travel agency organizes the tour for the sold tours.
Before concluding the contract, travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with, among other things, data on management and number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to insurance companies.
Every month, travel agencies will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold, and the amount of advances and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will call on it according to the draft to correct it or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in case the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to amend the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will contain a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the legislator did not think about the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who purchased the tour before the termination of insurance will lose it, according to the association.
In such a case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies on our market, said Jan Papež, Vice-President of the Association.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains a banking guarantee institute, but so thoughtlessly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot amount to an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the entire law will have to be recast.
There are currently 942 insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ended their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after talks with German prime ministers.
It also called once again for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member countries.
We need to do more to help the countries from which refugees are leaving or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work towards decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German chancellor, according to which such a signal could include increased financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
“The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries,” Merkel said.
Brandenburg’s Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The Czech Republic has long rejected the distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
The majority of the money spent by Germany on the care of refugees must be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we can integrate the refugees, they can be of benefit to us,” he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted Afroametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a diversity discussion claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight project, the actor cast in the series interrupted Brown, stressing the need for alternative perspectives on the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by casting a movie, not by casting a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disbelief, sighing "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as comments about the Martian made it onto the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker being picked up by a white pimp.
Producer Dear White People championed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon reprised that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
A Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the mouth of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took on a national effect and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement while listing the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leader presented a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers, and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has first winner"
Professional climber Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men fought their way to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over a 220 m long rope.
Britten climbed first within the set limit and became the first competitor to overcome the debilitating 4th leg in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News right after his hard-earned win and it was noticeable that he was still in shock from winning the $1 million grand prize.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
“So all of a sudden... I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed interviewed The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finale and why Britten won't receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who finishes the track the fastest.
“If there are more competitors, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
“I don’t think he’s holding a grudge.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He’s a hero to his wife and children.”
Geoff told me, “If there was going to be someone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers walk right past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams in the world, are in the last place in the Central Division of the American League right now.
The Tigers only narrowly averted their defeat when they defeated Minnesota in Tuesday's match with a close 5-4 result at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and captivate the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun, no matter how,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the shots and 3 circuits.
It was his third game of the last nine games.
“I want to finish this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re often on the bench and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 runs and his first drawn point since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's got a lot on his plate," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in practice, he batted noticeably better and he managed to transfer it into the match."
Thanks to the three circuits at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton earned an innings thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored thanks to a set bat, and Simon went on strike with Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent Mauer, and in front of him was batsman Miguel Sano, who batted the ball and ran two bases, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a chance to draw in the second innings, VerHagen managed to send the third finisher over two bases.
Plouffe has already scored 27 runs over two bases this season and reigns league table.
Detroit retained their ninth inning, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked San out on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored points while playing Phil Hughes.
The Tigers gained three runs in the first two innings against a retired right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month's hiatus due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t think I’d have a start like that,” Hughes said, “but by the third inning, I felt like I was doing better.”
After resisting the onslaught in the first innings, Hughes dropped one point to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right fielder J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to circumnavigate all the bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right of the pitch and scored another circuit, but Victor Martinez was bowled over when he attempted to finish on third base.
The Tigers added in the second innings when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose scored them two and conversely one point, with a score of 3-0 on the resulting board.
“That brought us to our knees,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
“He didn’t hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place.”
Hughes, who won on the number of pitches, finished in the third inning with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, scoring six bats and four strikeouts.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the true pitcher of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to play in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after an injury and play against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded to left-back David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 games.
However, since August 20, he has not yet played due to a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game together at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said regarding the 16th meeting of the central group to deepen the overall reform.
Promoting openings in nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, as well as provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, a relaxation of the border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital, and a reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, there may be new bed wards.
According to Jakub Pánik, Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region (ČSSD), the current capacity of the wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the wards of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, a one-day surgery center could be established in the surgical department, where according to the set concept, surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals the day-to-day surgery facilities should be.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be established with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to care for patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which seems to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the beds of aftercare, in particular the beds of the Long-Term Sick Care Centre (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and above all should be closely linked to the acute care beds.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommended concept.
As he points out, aftercare beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, there are no social health beds in the Karlovy Vary Region with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could also serve as a so-called Alzheimer's center for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, on which European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of supraspecialized care and will be a space for translating patients after surgery, for example after cardiac, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery," the regional concept of inpatient care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
