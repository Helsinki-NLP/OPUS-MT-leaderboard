Welsh National Assembly Members Fear They Will Be Called Muppets
This is the result of a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea came about in connection with plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of mockery.
One Labour MP expressed his group's concerns, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means excrement.
Plaid Cymru, one of the party’s politicians, said his party was “dissatisfied” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that the sound of the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee working within the assembly, which is currently working on a bill changing the name, took the following position: "Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the assembly members will be their own."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP in English, although this abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The difficulty of reaching a consensus is a nuisance for Elin Jones, the president of the assembly, who should present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform bill will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules for recalling members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is to help resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change is necessary to allow the state to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells ring at St. Martin’s Church in New York City due to church problems in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is no trace of them now.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people are socializing in a different way,” he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of community members."
In the case of churches, however, he is worried that the funds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as decision-makers believe, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the remaining nearby temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people buying housing in such buildings will be white. This will speed up the total closure of churches, as new residents are unlikely to become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original white Methodist congregation left the district in the 1930s.
A local assembly of African Americans then took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an assembly chaired by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors from 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street), opposing the hiring or promotion of African Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, however, John Howard Johnson parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell assembly.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who knocked the bells in July, described them in a different way, as a “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world operated by a black musician. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to Riverside Church, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events in St. Martin’s Church involving architects and contractors, some of which have been brought to the site by lay church leaders, and some by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it "wants to shift costs to the council", although the council did not participate in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they swam up to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but he soon realized that the child was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin in the clavicle area.
“I started yelling at everyone to run away from the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel said.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego. His condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted several weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to the species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
For the purpose of the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
More than 135 species of sharks live in the area, although most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury’s is planning to expand into the UK cosmetics market.
The Sainsbury's chain is throwing the gauntlet at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, bringing to their supermarkets cosmetic departments that allude in style to department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK beauty market - which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly growing despite declines in the fashion and household goods industry - 11 stores belonging to the network will have larger shelves with cosmetic products. If the initiative succeeds next year, the activities will be extended to further points.
The turn to the cosmetics industry results from the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury’s, the chain will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. For the first time, products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear in the assortment.
L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its range of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most items will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points at two Sainsbury’s supermarkets, the first one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second one will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the chain tries to fight discount stores like Aldi or Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing food sales and increasing the profitability of the investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a joint venture with Boots as a trial venture. However, the cooperation was terminated following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is launching a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for an amount of ?125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by bringing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the chain’s four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to improve the customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers while shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as question the ways of shopping so far.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den TV show, was “angry” when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of the 11-million-pound lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a new collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den.
According to the sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds he would not have time to devote to their brand offering accessories and household items Truly.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was expected to double Holly Willoughby's estimated 11 million pound fortune.
After Holly Willoughby announced her decision to leave the brand on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK for one of his summer homes.
According to the source, “Truly was Holly Willoughby’s top priority.
She had her own future with her and she wanted to take care of it for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to entering the market.
The Marlow Warehouse holds goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of This Morning and one of the UK’s most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products - including articles from pillows to candles to clothing and household items - as well as further delaying entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as CEO.
The couple spent their vacations together, and Jones took a 40% stake in the television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the remark, which some considered "inappropriate to the statesman", as well as the positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
“I gave up nothing.”
The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an “analogous response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have had positive effects: they have led to the completion of missile tests, helped release the hostages and returned the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid efforts.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not demanding international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid from international organizations should be allowed.
Faced with the upheavals constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu - despite the warning issued - likely had an impact on the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading to the city of Palu to help the victims of the earthquake. However, it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's infrastructure a focal point of his campaign and has allocated a ton of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the president's administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo found himself under pressure due to the country’s ongoing religious tensions, with members of the majority Muslim community adopting a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of residents lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons in the streets.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match played at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1-0 to the detriment of his team.
Before firing towards the goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball soared high above the penalty area towards the top right corner of the net.
Then he came to the door, and the door was opened.
“I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to bring it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot possible,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I took the ball and I shot without thinking deeply.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovačić and then ran towards half of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted the application in the middle of the pitch.
He then made a beautiful play forward in the penalty box back to Hazard.
Gambling overtook the defenders and left-footed a shot towards the long post that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said Sunday that the death toll from the country’s recent earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 people.
During the conference, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of Friday's 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble.
The city of Palu, inhabited by more than 380,000 people, is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
After the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, an investigation was launched into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious event.
Brian O’Hagan, Commissioner for Investigations, said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to make a call to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead at the time who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose recorders could record materials useful during the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to enter a residential building, but was informed by police that entry and exit are currently prohibited.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told they would not be able to return to their homes anytime soon.
It was heard that one of the officers had explained to the man that the area was now considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were parked on the fenced-off area, and another police vehicle was parked next to it.
Inside the separate zone are officers guarding the residential building.
Persons with information are invited to contact us via Twitter (@MerPolCC) or by phone at number 101, or to anonymously report via the Crimestoppers organization at number 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's memorial in front of British Parliament last victim in dispute over 'writing history anew'
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban's reminiscent actions of destroying many of England's cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanical supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s character outside the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The iconoclastic actions during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell on the monument testifies to the reputation of this politician in the 19th century and that for many people he is still a figure worth commemorating.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was seen by many, perhaps more often in the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament from outside pressure.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated".
In China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, there was a deadly pig attack on a farmer in a market in the south-western part of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloodied and with a severed artery near a pigsty in a market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou.
A pig farmer is preparing to be vaccinated at a pig farm, Xining City, Qinghai Province (China), on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on its face.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a 200-pound pig that killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and bruised,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that during the time of gathering evidence by the police, the piglet was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
There have been cases of attacks of pigs on humans before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig had nailed a farmer to a tractor.
After eating an Oregon farmer by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, however, the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the right respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, the hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa blows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern Time, it was given category 1. It was located at that time 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it is beginning to form rather than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving masses of humid air north to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the following days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the South West of the USA.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, the displacement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause rainfall of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is forecast in some areas of the Southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Due to the diffuse nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot through the desert.
Heavy downpours can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusty winds and dust displacement.
Upcoming than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small displacements of pollutants and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The fleeting tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, with the cooling in the Arctic region across the United States, there may be temperature fluctuations.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A good example is Sunday's temperature differences in the central United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa), these differences are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations Thursday's touching hearing of Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing the lawyer of sexual harassment occurring in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly aired programs to report the sudden reversal: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was groping her in a state of intoxication and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that the number of TV viewers on Friday was even higher than the 20.4 million given by Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, figures were not yet available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
The given number is similar to the viewing of American football cup competitions or the awards of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day audition.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure in Friday's events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the video, he yells at the protesters who made it difficult for him to get into the elevator on his way to the hearing of the judiciary committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you and I’m asking.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
You have the strength in the face of the impotence of so many women," he said.
Prior to the elevator door closing, Jeff Flake said his office had made a statement and that he would speak during the committee's hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would support the nomination only if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was persuaded in part by talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page, former foreign minister in her government Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the aftermath of Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could levy tariffs on their own behalf, calling it "completely ridiculous".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana (LSU).
Police in Baton Rouge have arrested and placed 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in custody for second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police reported that during the fight Sims lost his glasses.
According to CBS News, police officers found the glasses and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
The defendant’s lawyer said the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked local law enforcement for "the diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re always afraid of,” said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
Ash rising from Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans against approaching the volcano due to an increase in activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center recorded numerous rumbles and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between Catalan independence protesters and riot police. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme referendum on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked supporters of the separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust enveloped the streets, usually full of tourists.
The clashes also occurred later in the day, with police forces using batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while anti-secessionists shouted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people received medical attention due to minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, tensions have not waned, and although the authorities in Madrid have deemed it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate Catalans who want to secede.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the turnout was low due to a wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, however, a change of route was forced.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalan independence.
“Last year we had one of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents wept with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point of no return," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, parties supporting Catalonia’s secession are struggling to continue. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in custody due to the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a protest on the phone in support of police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in detention since the end of last year, announced his willingness to run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“To run for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit several times by a car at a house in the city of Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent at around 7:30pm BST on Thursday.
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow could also be fired at the car.
Mengi's goal secures Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
Starting this season, Livingston stunned the Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in his 18 games as the club's head coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be a win, and Gary Holt's team moved up to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season without a Premiership win. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which it loses eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston has extended his division win streak to six games. Coach Holt hasn't lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed several opportunities against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot into the goal light, but failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow missed after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing they could threaten their rivals during the fixed portions of the game.
This is how the final goal was scored.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to create the situation for Menda, who scored a goal from the center of the penalty box.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possession, however, they were unable to push through the defense of the hosts and did not cause major problems for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half. Alfredo Morelos scored one shot on Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the light of the goal from another permanent piece adjudged in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
Livingston's Phenomenal Performance - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the league. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, but Menga made it necessary for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to be very careful throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although under Gerrard’s leadership, there are great moments, they did not maintain their standards in this match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once they managed to break through the hosts' defense. This should be a serious warning for Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
It is home to the largest number of Turks outside their homeland.
Police said 25,000 people were blocked from gathering outside the temple for security reasons, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt a politician in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions caused by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
The cyclist was killed after crashing into a car in London.
The accident occurred near the congested intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the city's southeastern district, at around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and paramedics arrived on the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile from the scene of Saturday’s accident).
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working to identify the dead man and inform family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus detours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Authorities said six officers were injured in riots at a men’s detention center.
Riots at the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began at about 9:30 a.m. British time (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
For riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant, a specialized unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers on the scene sustained minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities and we are confident that those responsible will be turned over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
According to reports, in June, the director of the plant had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, preventive troops were called to the plant due to dangerous riots in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur early next week. The remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, on Tuesday Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rains will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, just ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona state border".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast precipitation with a height of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa can bring relief as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
While floods pose a serious threat, some rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought prevails.
According to weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first reach the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. She is currently located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a high risk of flooding.
Weather.com reported that "an area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora State is predicted to have rainfall of 7 to 15 cm, although it may reach 25 cm."
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning, it will reach the border of the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will wander to the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora State, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
According to forecasts, the rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and shifting of pollutants in the desert and mudslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a 16-year-old found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at around 4:00 BST.
The victim was taken to the hospital and remains “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers will contact anyone who has access to the footage of the incident.
Trump says Brett Kavanaugh 'experienced the meanness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that several decades ago, when they were both teenagers, the man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during a hearing on her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans could see the brilliance, the class and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of support for one of the most eminent lawyers of our time, an expert on the law with great merits for the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly address the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not running in this election, but I’m very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats have a policy of “resisting and hindering activity.”
As one of the assistants of an important Republican politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of them by high waves crashing into beaches, in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Pal, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in a festival held in the city. At dusk, waves reaching up to 6 meters in height hit the shore, abducting many people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the threat arose yesterday, people on the beach did not immediately flee and were the victims of a tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything in its path, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho reported. He then added that before reaching the shoreline, the element was moving at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by aftershocks.
There have been a number of earthquakes in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people are believed to be missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
According to Nugroho, the communication "has been completely paralyzed", and therefore there are no reports from Donggala province.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
“We can already speak about the tragedy, although the situation may get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming from a building, trying to warn of an impending tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the wall of water crashed to the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within the Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the military has begun sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The airport located in the city was opened exclusively for humanitarian aid transports. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit centers for people evacuated in Palu.
More than 800 people died in the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseb T. Sinay, World Vision’s national director, the organization’s staff arrived safely from Donggala Province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly beginning to help, there have been criticisms that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience are prevented from traveling to Pal.
Under Indonesian law, accepting funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster site has been declared an area of national disaster.
This has not been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,” an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman said.
"When the government decides that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not happened yet."
Two days after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Pal, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled from the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, has been training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono told how, within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was sending messages via WhatsApp to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue-colored hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Replenishing Cash at ATM at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a statement from Newport police headquarters, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was replenishing cash at an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man “runs from behind to a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thieves are requested to contact Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
In announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: "A person formerly known as Kanye West".
The forty-one-year-old musician has already used the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change came before a visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album called Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who she said had resigned “for emotional reasons.”
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures, it means ‘you’,” West said earlier in the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter nicknamed Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye - a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, also wrote down his nickname in various ways, with a hyphen, without a hyphen, and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in Three Cultures Square, López Obrador promised "never to use the military to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square for a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support the young people of Mexico by providing monthly financial aid for learners as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The comment is related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Last year, China presented its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"To begin with, we need to double the budget for AI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubling funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is president of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that beat the then-best American player in Othello. He then held a leadership position at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous technology initiatives of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the struggle, because it will help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to make great efforts to receive government subsidies.
“It’s not China that’s taking away the best representatives of academia, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
“I think that people who have an AI degree should automatically be given a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the U.S. National Science Foundation and other government organizations granting funding to U.S. scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also announced that it will allocate $2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 billion annually in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national commission on the security of artificial intelligence has not moved a step forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory. Therefore, it vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President Orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the turnout would reach the minimum level of 50% required to make the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU in the wake of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia - one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia - to such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us all with greater security,” said 79-year-old Oleifera Georgijewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission reported that no unusual events had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at that time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election of 2016, when 66% of eligible voters voted.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Oosze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in the city of Strumica in Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name to open the way to NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents spread out by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organizations with our heads held high, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in Sunday’s referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
For a vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The defeat in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since taking power last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton home in a 2-0 home game for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with a midfield pass to the Argentine striker.
The player overtook Brighton's three defenders.
Aguero was among Brighton's four players.
He first outplayed one of them, then overtook the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penalty field.
He then played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a penalty field, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with a foot injury," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to get a goal during that time.”
However, it was Sterling who provided the Blues with their first Premier League lead.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great pass along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to the far post.
The Manchester City striker pointed the ball into the net just before it fell on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the chance to play in the playoffs by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to play in the first line-up.
However, rival Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, as long as the Rockies keep their chances of playing in the playoffs, and the team currently has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's game against the Nationals with a 5:2 score.
“Even though we’re playing ‘nothing’, at least we’ll come out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to attend this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday's match. The team, however, is inclined to put Scherzer in the first lineup.
This would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first line-up. The contestant took part in Thursday's shoot-out training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington-based team pitcher scores 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 eliminated batters and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds during the season.
Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly address his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In November, we are putting all our achievements on the line.
We are five weeks away from some of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our great candidates" - he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal, but we won’t give it to them.”
As he said, Democrats are pursuing a mission of “resisting and hindering activity.”
“It’s been very clear in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, mean, unpleasant, and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, recalling the U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which was met with loud booing from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
"Uh, hello?
No... I mean... no». Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their own opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to give me a reprimand, I was not surprised.
In the end, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have been told recently that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan faced similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a reprimand was due to a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday, Labour MPs from Nottingham East said: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
In my eight years as a Labour MP, most of the afternoon General Committee meetings on Friday were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are different now, and the promise of a "more cordial and gentler" policy, if ever remembered, has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no tolerance for dissenting views in the Labour Party. Each opinion is judged on its compatibility with the party leadership.
It all started not long after Jeremy Corbyn took over as president, and colleagues, who I thought had similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would have disagreed with before, on issues such as national security and the EU single market.
After every public speech, regardless of the content, I encounter attacks on social media calling for the removal of nominations, condemnation of centrism or leaving the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are more political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment on a daily basis, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is the move to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of no confidence” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview narrows down.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to lean out and keep quiet about certain issues. Then everything would be “okay”.
That’s not why I took politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government that led to the breakup of my school classroom, I have striven to provide a better quality of public service to those in need - both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew of the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday’s motion, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be of service to you. I promise that no threat of revocation or ad hoc political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 - Ayr undefeated again
Two late touchdowns may have somehow distorted the final result. However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win in this extremely interesting Scottish Extraliga match.
The team placed first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
At the end, it was the outstanding defense and better use of opportunities that led the home team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied with his charges.
“The games so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to pay our respects to the Ayr players. They took better advantage of the opportunities than we did.”
Ayr came out in the lead in the 14th minute after placing Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Clim. However, a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, who had come on the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after a penalty kick just before the end of the first half. He first scored a touchdown and later took a chance for a raise, scoring 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well. Patrick Anderson's touchdown raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
There was then a longer suspension due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury. The player was lifted from the pitch on a stretcher. After the resumption, Ayr increased the lead after a touchdown by Stafford McDowall and a Clim elevation.
Ayr's acting team captain Blair Macpherson was subsequently given a yellow card. Melrose reused his numbers: a touchdown with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking down Clim without the ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown on the back of the approaching defence.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise. He then managed to raise the score again just after the game resumed when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty shot and enabled winger Gregor Henry to score a fifth touchdown for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game begins his career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the series Still Game, seems to be starting out in the catering industry. It was recently discovered that he became the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom. He co-stars and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "developing catering industry" in Glasgow.
‘The sea belongs to us’: Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying from public buildings.
In the naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In the uninhabited sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, and Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. The residents are unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch a meeting of the International Court of Justice together. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia's claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also has hope in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts say that the chances of a favorable ruling for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also warned that it would not affect the arrangements for possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments are presented. Such a short time shows that the case “was not complicated”.
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years may have distanced the country from its goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zárate said.
Morales's relentless rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any vestige of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end a 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the issue of access to the sea as part of a political game.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The ruling is an excellent opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen until it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep promises made at the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “frozen” that the lack of lifting of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War have ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament measures first.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling the arsenal that is seen in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of great headwear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely cover yourself from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a number of crazy, oversized headwear included in their summer 2019 collection, which dazzled with style during Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats dominated Instagram this summer. The mentioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery roundabout flooding the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had a sewn-in mouth and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don’t want to break up with great fashion, you’re in luck.
Style watchers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
The undersized hats follow La Bomba, a straw hat with a 61-cm-wide brim that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which spilled over social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as large as a model wearing it in a swimsuit.
Fired orange bag from the reef, finished with fringes from the reef and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer - because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their academic achievements - in 2018 they were able to boast another excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools with more than 30,000 students across Scotland strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages rank first in league rankings, with the highest pass rates in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored higher on A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of learners of German, 69 percent of learners of French, and 63 percent of learners of Spanish also scored on A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as elective subjects, is conducted in the same scope as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people to start their professional careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills.
Lifelong skills, such as learning a second language, will give you a huge advantage in the future, regardless of your career path.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of speakers was double-digit, i.e. 15%.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered the most important for the UK in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed - whatever the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a large choice, variety and level.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans looking to see LeBron James debut in the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play in Sunday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After training, which took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to participate in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five election rallies planned by Trump to be held next week, along with stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote confirming the suspension of his election to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia be held tonight, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place today at 7pm, i.e. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s election campaign in West Virginia will be streamed live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which were held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated Senate vote to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, pending an FBI investigation.
The main purpose of this series of election rallies, however, is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign with five rallies next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point on the president’s schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said.
Today's election rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" - West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia - a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 - for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Keeping Hope of Winning in Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon may have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but one that athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like these.
So what does their momentum look like at this point?
“They’ve led by six points and now they’re only leading by four, so I think we’ve got a little momentum,” Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are still twelve to be won.
Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy role models, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of scoring three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
Shouts of excitement became louder throughout his round, sinking a key putt and winning the match as he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His rebound on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, was met with a similar cry - one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
“Just focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for any of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and were not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players must be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played at different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double to the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, there's no one to help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and took a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has a knack for fighting, which some, especially in the U.S., doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome matches against the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo took on two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing their Le Golf National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the non-target American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States faced more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for the losses.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points out of the 12 singles to be held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while with Molinari (the team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format in superb style, they defeated the pumped-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 score.
Woods, who overcame two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not participating in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, both ranked 1st and 3rd respectively.
However, the European team did not go all the way on this pleasant, cool day in the field south-west of Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 result in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team make up for the four-point loss by starting singles, although Furyk's team would only need a draw to retain the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says 'definitive no' to unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the failure to lift sanctions only exacerbates North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and committing to non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any specific response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's reluctance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as it has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent President of the United States and the leader of North Korea held on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is insisting on ‘denuclearization first’ and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of a ‘declaration to end the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who behave towards us in an ignorant way.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If South Korea had been a party to the denuclearization issue and not the United States, then there would have been no such impasse on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
The tone of Ri’s speech was completely different compared to last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea’s missiles on U.S. territory is inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but also said much work needed to be done, and also stated that until North Korea is stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until full, final and verified denuclearization is established.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, and within hours North Korea condemned him for "making gangster demands."
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cared about were the security guarantees Trump had pledged to provide in Singapore and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on adequately long rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of “all-night caffeine-powered students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired to give a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“After the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only told this now that I’m in my final year of college?’
She stated that no one ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
During the course, which was held for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation within a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive assignments.
One section includes a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not result in an immediate change in student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “all-night learning” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring enough good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even avoid weight gain because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic device screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered once again during the away fight at Livingston, when Dolly Menga's shot led to the defeat of the dismantled team of Steven Gerrard, scoring 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first win since the 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team to score a difference of eight points against Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment didn't look like he was going to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third - just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may be in further trouble with the need to patch up the head injury of line referee Calum Spence after he was hit with an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and advance to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same Livingston eleven who took away the Hearts team's point last week, being delighted with the way his well-trained team tortured their opponents every step of the way.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but it was the Livingston team that did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow playing in the defender position could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers managed only two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s 34-minute opening goal may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep solid piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, serving to Menga for a simple finish of the action.
Gerrard took a break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, an influence almost immediately on the winger who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it out from his position.
The Livingston team continued to pull the guys into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett made long passes one after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the lead in the final minutes, but McGregor made a good bet against Jacobs, after which Lithgow dismissed the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, was hoping for another penalty kick when he got tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our edition of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 - 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become an element of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring these seemingly unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you will hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Enemy Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells as part of the treatment.
This method involves separating the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells, ovarian cancer atrophy was observed for more than 18 months.
The method involves separating the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “perceive” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is prognosticating very well.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells worked in the treatment of some type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third track titled Ghost Town that night, during which he wore a hat that read “Make America Great,” he made a speech against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist!’”
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
“They came at me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They're on to me!
And then they say I have no choice," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You’re saying I have no choice?” adding, “I’m going to put on a superman’s cape so you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to go forward?
Let's accept ourselves."
His words caused the audience to “booze” twice, and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Variety. The person who was in the studio during these events: “There was a grave silence in the studio.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by the performance of the song I Love It in the guise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR THE VOICE OF THE MAFIA.”
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, said on Twitter that West “was just being himself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who, I believe, accepts and spreads an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also free,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name - he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friend of the rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegations of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor struck a stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think that they have to act tough to be respected.
In a Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he felt "quite confident" about the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point - where did we go wrong on the subject of masculinity?" he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time - what can be done to change it?
It is clear that all is not well with young men."
He also confessed in an interview that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following year, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on set, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of love interest for the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China sees 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to health workers in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people thus infected with HIV has been almost completely reduced, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members leaked data from Republican senators - "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory."
Rep. Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to “ultra-right wingers.”
“Lies, lies and even more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The public information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The news was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct directed against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters cabinet and published information regarding a member of the Waters team, Hill said.
“This baseless allegation is completely false, and it’s a 100 percent lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my team - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false, and it is a hundred percent lie."
The Waters statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This kind of denial is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be wrong.
It cannot provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the accuser.
He has to stay calm for that.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of displaying excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her cabinet had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations."
“The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to justice for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Johnny English: Knockout - A Spy Parody with a Weakened Rowan Atkinson
Finding references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the “Johnny English” action and comedy film series, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English” and returned to cinemas in 2011 with “Johnny English: Reactivation”.
Will the self-ridiculous satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, the ever-astonished, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has been re-licensed to wreak havoc - his name more than anything else signals that he is an elaborate, comical creation intended for non-English-speaking audiences.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre fondness for smoothie glamour, has a touch of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Bean and a drop of this guy adding one note to the theme tune of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world man-mystery - Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there are one or two notable moments.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by the rotor blades.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be clearly seen on screen, but his sense of humor seems to be quite low-key and unnecessary, especially since now "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer comedic elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults - in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and coherent as gags in Atkinson's silent films about Jasiu Besola.
It has always been the case that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker infiltrates the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents working in the field - much to the dismay of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a minor role.
This is the last straw in the Prime Minister’s bitterness, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power to play Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop her wings.
Her advisers from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to restore one of the retired agents to service.
And that means the inept Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent -- some pretty good gags while giving English's spy lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for briefing, reuniting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man tied to a submarine commander - a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, Batman and Robin brawl in Her Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the ominous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters setting fire to a French restaurant; bringing chaos by sneaking aboard a luxury Volta yacht; and English wreaks havoc while using a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's home.
In the latter sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and loud performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
Typical mediocrity.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan that provides for a four-day workweek for the British, for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary for five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, getting the same amount of salary.
Sources say that the idea will “fit” into the party’s economic program and plans to meet the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the change in the economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times: “A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of this year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is something that fits into the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea - the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and its introduction is not being considered."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculators" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back, as the Labour government could make “deductions” based on the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up integrative ownership funds to give 10 percent of the private sector's equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes: Can the FBI Investigating Kavanaugh Change Their Mindset?
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether findings by the Bureau of Investigation could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“On my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when this allegation came up and asked, “Did you do it?”
He was strong, strong and clear.”
Graham's opinion, however, seems to have been forged in stone.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it takes a strong charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he gave could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that boasts an impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission to eradicate poverty around the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the most important goal of the event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you decided to purchase a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a number of tasks or “activities” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant activities to help raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast of in the perspective of 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or is it another case of so-called “clickism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “actions” from campaign supporters since 2011 to pursue a number of different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help tackle malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen members sent over 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was “How can we be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?”.
Global citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we’re going to stumble and fail.
But like the great civil rights and apartheid movements of our time, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars of this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to ‘block’ Russian energy exports
Washington may resort to its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke-Washington Examiner has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate on energy trade, as they are in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, through its navy, has the ability to make sure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to “a ponytail with one trick” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came as the Trump administration continued its mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe - a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “slave” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of an economic nature only.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to meddle in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and that includes women in top positions,” she told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for president."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying she was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren bluntly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released on Thursday showed, however, that a majority of Warren voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the option "probably" said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken from reference to a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's PTSD During Donald Trump's Election Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested on Monday and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at Donald Trump's election rally in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a taboo subject" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if they will show respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the military have given their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, soliciting false testimony in a report of domestic violence, and possession of a gun in an intoxicated state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new United States policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with this policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" mistreated her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where there are large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries struggling with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be processed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that a policy denying immigrants entry harmed the U.S. economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and "become a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group, or who have such and no other political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - even the serious ones - that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts at Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her hot-tempered son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance brings in the bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching through water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had suffered a fracture to his spine and arm, were resting outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside for severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was squeezed into the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The US ambassador accuses China of “harassment” with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in the US daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional election on November 6th.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now escalating the trade war that has led to tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were to affect exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa state governor - the main exporter of agricultural products to China - said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China "now begins harassment with doubled force by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the respected American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
But there will be no dissenting voices in the Beijing street newsstand and no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women with right to vote ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already want to officially vote.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) last-minute FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington-based newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate lobby because Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall, and that’s true.
But he may be taller, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could be met with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party needs to deal with a big mess,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to trust in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having slightly more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied while giving testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a party while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform - Solid - owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“The historic moment has come.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own “online store with personal data” or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and relevant skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
“I’m not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been heavily involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to think about the next era in network development,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: decoration of the clergyman with the Victoria Cross during the First World War
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who during the First World War was awarded the Victoria Cross, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for advancing on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone exactly on the centenary of his grandfather's decoration was "of an exceptionally symbolic nature."
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
He then rushed to the line of fire and, with "the greatest courage" led her forward, then single-handedly launched an attack on the field guns station, incapacitating three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never handle, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the thrill-packed Bellator 206 and ultimately not be able to see the main fight.
The show featured 13 fights in San Jose, including six on the home tab, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked to see the show change to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning specifically to see this fight.
One fan on Twitter described the conversion to a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to government regulation, content of this type is inappropriate for being released at 6 a.m., making it necessary to change to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work out a schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday morning at six o’clock, and we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of program, we were covered with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't a glitch. It was a legal issue.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six - that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much and unfortunately we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'worse' because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on the show for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "simultaneously liking boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: “To this day, this feeling of being less valuable and different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “worth something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and wanted to give others “hope” in this way.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, he said, “it was hard for him to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I understood that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics - it was the best feeling possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which accompanied him in his preparations for the Olympic Games and which continues to give him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will set his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, playing for the twelfth time in the biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with him on the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day cheering the team and working to improve his game in the hope of fixing the cause of his being sent back to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never gave the simplest shots, even at the peak of his career, does not perform well on the tight Le Golf National field, where vicious shots are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn’t daunting enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesc Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with a verve, Mickelson's match may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player - he could not have done anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his individual accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws to his credit. Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he’s funny, and it’s good to have him in the band room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings so much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
He made his debut for Valderrama in 1997, where he and his teammate, Vice-Captain Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but missed the finish line by the shortest hair possible, winning 141-2-131-2.
“You can’t forget that we had a big advantage on Valderrama; we also had a big advantage on Brookline, where we lost, and in the case of Valderrama we only won by a hair,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
Time will tell me, and all the members of the team, that this is not over.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It will only end when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I’ve said from the beginning that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are, the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that’s another thing.
It’s good to play with your partner when things are going your way, but when you’re playing alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
That’s the message that we have to give to the players tomorrow.
Your partner has to do their best as well.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to perform better on their own than when playing with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced major turnarounds on his last day as a member of the winning team at Brookline, after which he suffered a defeat after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah field".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players to fight on the last day.
"Tomorrow we are playing 12 important games - you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brookline and Medinah.
If this momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European team players in the top half of the program.
“I’ve decided on this group of guys in that order because I think he’s going to be able to handle the whole game,” Bjorn said of his singles picks.
New German warship delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it won’t be until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the words of a military spokesman.
The ship should be added to the Navy in 2014, but due to the problems that arose after the delivery, it was necessary to introduce changes to this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among others, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances - it should be possible to operate new frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
The constant delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time the service begins, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships are to be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half as many as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also found the ship to be far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the German-built ships of the same class during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the commissioning of the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the strength of the German naval fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "running out of ships capable of use".
He also said that the problem has increased over time due to the decommissioning of old vessels without providing replacement vessels.
He also expressed his displeasure that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be included in the navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
The new research, conducted at the Highlands estate in Scotland, aims to show how bats use the landscape to acquire food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future efforts to protect them.
The research, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will involve common and small dwarfs, as well as long-eared brown bats and bats from the red nocturnal family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special recorders will be deployed to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct fieldwork using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape-scale behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect perches and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly adhesives and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to the nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, inspections of the perch, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the grounds of the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that it is an ideal territory for bats.
“Threeve has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
It highlights the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance work on the estates, as the inadvertent destruction of one perch can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected - killing them, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their perch is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we don’t even know how their populations fare.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges as His Lawyers Intend to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying that people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Portuguese striker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, the player was ordered to pay the woman $375,000 for her silence.
Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were announced, described the news as “fake news” in an Instagram live message to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s news is fake news,” said the five-time gold-ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” he added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they called "unacceptable privacy allegations," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who was fooled by that “one percent.”
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she still can’t forget the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying .100 million euros for him.
Brexit: UK would “forever regret” carmakers leaving
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after leaving the European Union, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “concerned” when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, then there will be a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, plans to close its Mini car plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the UK leaving the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not have lasted more than a day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid border controls.”
“We need an agreement, and we want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy our current success, but also allow us to take advantage of this situation,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but also those of other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota's representative office was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Works Council of Unite, said union members were increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” due to the ongoing fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump's close associates and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wiretap to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was postponed to avoid interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
A spokeswoman for Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll be sure to tell the press.”
Several journalists questioned the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason for this.
Sanders said a small number of press conferences were not due to aversion to "ostentatious" TV journalists, adding: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatious."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president conducts more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We have become familiar with the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done this very often, and press conferences will give way to sessions where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, behaving too casually and sometimes bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Health minister writes to European Union workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to express gratitude to them from the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter for less than six months until the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processing settled status applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union have continued and the relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that empower and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers forward, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with the team's defeat to Tennessee with a score of 31-27, Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He approached the sideline, then he slid to the ground,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on a stretcher and carried it out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a sophomore released from college representation for a year to further his skills) plays his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On the Saturday before the end of the match he had five charge, which gives him 18 charge throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory plans, buyers from abroad will be charged higher stamp duties for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury said it would raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying properties in the UK will be charged a higher stamp duty, and the additional funds thus obtained will be used to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on more earners.
Higher stamp duties will apply to individuals and non-taxpaying businesses in the UK, with additional funding to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee - charged in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates for second houses and apartments purchased for rent introduced two years ago - may amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise as much as 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult to buy your first home or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many affluent regions, especially the capital, have turned into “ghost cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "housing scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and an end to evictions "for no reason".
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that as prime minister I would be committed to rebuilding Britain’s dream of making every generation’s life better than the last.
It also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, but the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest ambition is to be Scotland’s selector”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is committed to healing the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
but I only managed to get to the B-team," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I used to watch Scotland’s Hampden games with my father and I was always drawn to that.
But that will only come if I succeed as the club’s coach.”
Ross's predecessors included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel intimidated to take on the role after such illustrious personalities at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me now will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and facilities, there is no doubt that its place is there" - he adds.
“It’s not going to be easy to do, but I’ll probably feel like I’m successful here, only if I succeed.”
Ross' coaching career has only been going on for three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and was part of the Hearts coaching team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa advance again after being relegated to the third league, and in the following season led the St Mirren team from the brink of decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” Alloa recalls.
“I really believed that leading a team was much better for me than just playing.
It will sound strange, because as a player I was doing well, earning well and achieving some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure of being a coach, but I feel good in that role.
I’ve always wanted to coach others, and now I’m doing it, and I can say that right now I feel most at home in my entire adult life.”
The full interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Studies show that the best time for a beer is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a surge of customers to the British pubs, but it was reflected by hiccups in restaurant chains.
Studies have shown that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm that produced the data, says: “The continued heat and the longer-than-expected England’s participation in the World Cup made July’s results similar to June’s, when pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in July was even bigger.
The pubs and bars offering drinks performed by far the best - their increase in sales exceeded the decrease recorded in restaurants.
Food-serving pubs also suffered during the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just thirsty.
Beverage sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s entertainment and tourism analyst, said: “These results fit the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the amount of consumption ‘outside the home’ remain the weather and large sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are going through a difficult time is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences, considering the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favourable time for the owners of the restaurants serving food and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.

One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of “fake insta” pages.
The news has compounded fears that sexual content is being posted on it.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, set up social media accounts that they don’t disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts - the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has compounded fears that these accounts are used to post sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a well-maintained “main” account that they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One mother, who happened to stumble across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics management, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that bringing it to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to be able to give the voice of the athletes to the council, and I hope I can really help manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has victories in the 200 and 400 meters races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, can not walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a tough job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all your support!”
Breastfeeding advertising that compares mothers to cows arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactator company caused a storm on the internet by publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent breast pump to be worn under clothing,” its manufacturer, Elvie, has released a mocking video ad that highlights the freedom it gives mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn to a song in which the words are heard: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not just my tits."
And the chorus goes like this: "Pull it out, pump it out, I'll feed the children with it, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my ladies."
The advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused a lot of controversy on the Internet.
The video currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them saying that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Just like people, to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their children are taken away from them a few days after birth," one user wrote.

Another person commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise breast milkers for mothers who can keep their babies.”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others defended the clip, one of the women said she thought the song was "funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I don’t find a second bottom in it.
“It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who pull out their food (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with breast milkers attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many lactating women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies in their hands, and even leave the house while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By juxtaposing breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of pumping, while presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week during the show Marta Jakubowski appeared on the catwalk mother of two children with this product attached.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children being detained is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month is virtually unchanged. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear exposure to deportation if they report for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the common farm would be fingerprinted and then handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency has already arrested dozens of people who have volunteered as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been listed.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who sponsor or live with them in the same household are staying in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we’re constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained - rather than after 60 days, as was the case by previous standards.
Many will present themselves via videoconferencing rather than in person to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centers, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to overlook signals that something is wrong with the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to “conduct its holy battle until the cleansing of Syria’s territory” from both terrorist groups and “any foreigners staying on it illegally.”
There are currently around 2,000 US troops stationed in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in these returns," he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal has a "clear timeframe", and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition to draw up a draft of Syria’s post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to verifying the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the election again
By this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency ends early in an impeachment and scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency to date.”
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s primetime viewership has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s has nearly tripled, to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show, which aired on MSNBC, peaked at cable TV, attracting 3.5 million viewers in the evening.
"People fly like moths into the fire - that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, ABC's lead producer of "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
"Chaos has entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of immigrant family reunification, or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing a book called “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket (“clothes laden with pride,” as The Washington Post put it) or about the implications of shocking descriptions of the anatomy of the president.
I will never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he’s doing is in part like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily twists of the Trump show (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to be in arrears.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t help it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in jeopardy.
“I remember we used to do all these crazy shows and people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

Inflow of money from the outside to the electoral campaign for Congress
Unsurprisingly, after the reorganization of the constituencies, which now leaves two incumbents in the race for one seat, a cash river flows into Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district.
This recently formed Pittsburgh suburban district is represented in Congress by a Democrat representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former District 12 of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new District 17.
The county maps were revised after the January Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that the old counties were unfairly designated, which gave the Republicans an advantage and was unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th district began with a campaign funding fight between the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in a widely commented election for the 18th congressional district held in March.
He has been a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and by the time the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s corporate management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to cease recognising Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, among others to fight drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would have included restrictions on financial aid and the granting of visas to certain individuals, would have been very severe for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address conclusions from a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to speak, which is to be a signal of inviting representatives of the administration to the assembly.
Three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, accompanied by no new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal negotiations.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the report of the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which there is currently concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the US elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for his re-election to the electorate, and may even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that the collapse of Trump, or people in his equivalent positions in Europe, is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how much longer this may take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The railroads of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing the inevitable march of democracy.
There are several such turning points in front of the Americans now.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our newspaper that he offered a covert recording of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is found to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we elect to Congress, mid-term, those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we don't get through these trials, democracy will have a hard time.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future with optimism?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans looks forward to the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory against the Austrians, achieved after an impressive draw with Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the Europa League G group.
Until a 2-2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes the result will act as a springboard for Rangers to greater success.
“It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something - and we won the point.
Maybe in the end we could still push them, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
As for Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope to score three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and we will win a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my injury and the changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and be successful."
The fear of retirement savings sleeps women off their eyelids
Even though the people in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Where to begin?
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your will beforehand.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Funds for long-term care can come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property - if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent legal battles.
Appoint a trusted health care representative to supervise and ensure that the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information so you can have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin says.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having such a plan at hand.”
Man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot from a windbreaker as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as “accidental.”
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not endanger the life of the man. The police ask the witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to broken communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupaten, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some highlights of the city of Palu and the cabupate of Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
In 2017, it was estimated to have a population of 299,200.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which developed especially in the coastal cabupate of Donggala.
Another source of income for the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people were killed in the tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
Major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake occurred, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed as a result.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastation brought by the disastrous 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They have destroyed thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a designated bail of $500.
She said he was brought to trial last Saturday, where he said in his defence speech that he was "certainly innocent".
Palin has three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a prison day penalty and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting, and possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder he contracted while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in tsunami after Indonesia earthquake
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors call for death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who was suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment - it has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he ran over pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification filed in the Southern District of New York about the intention to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 items, including eight counts of murder in the course of illegal activity - a procedure typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases - and an allegation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required “solid planning and thought” and described the way Saipov carried it out as “monstrous, cruel and immoral.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrachi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who were in New York City.
The last time the death penalty was applied for in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse within months after the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was comfortable with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police said he was also demanding the display of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 charges, says he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys who represent Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and to refuse life imprisonment without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought upon all concerned," he said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
A former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel the heat” from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, “the UK would already be outside the EU.”
However, the addition of Tories opting to remain in the community to the separate protest against Brexit that was taking place in the city further underlined the burden of reconciling its deeply divided ranks facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan for a compromise with the Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies say that despite the opposition, it will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its proposal and the “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the plan out of the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become a proxy, to whom responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels should be transferred.
“If it was him, we would be out of the EU by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we need to get the Chequers plan out of the way.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory party, who supported Brexit, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our activists who populate the streets and who elected us do not support it either.
Please abandon the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “Prime Ministers maintain their positions as long as they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel the heat” if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them ‘we will not let you do this’.”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel the heat.
“We are mobilising the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
At the time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved “Tories against Brexit” banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for security issues with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who claim they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus plan, the smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and she means the woman at the top.”
The arrest of LSU team player Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in Friday’s shooting that killed LSU team basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released asking for help in identifying the man seen on it.
Wayde Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1.98-meter-high junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, with 10 starts in his last season, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the dance floor, scored 5.6 points and made 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team command enabled him to win against Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team’s command will have a big impact on the result of the race.
Bottas, who started from the pole, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the peloton tail, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rider rolled into the pits in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track, risking being pushed to the defensive after a double move by a rival aiming to defend his position on turn three, Hamilton advanced to the lead.
Max Verstappen took off from the end of the race and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race by not changing the tyres to make a quick finish and taking away Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
In the end, he drove to the service point on lap 44, but in the remaining eight laps he failed to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was asked to let me through.
The whole team gave their best to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianna Feinstein, who claimed that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "wicked, spiteful, and deceitful."
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, spiteful and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, have you revealed this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we disclose...No, we did not,” he added, mocking the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her cabinet.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
“She asked me to be discreet and I did not disclose this content as requested.”
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats are using innuendo for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power by all means.
You see meanness, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match against Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
Dundee Stars have atoned for their Friday loss to the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 home rematch on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-goal lead after being shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised the score again, scoring for the Dundee team, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss of the Elite League season to Adam Keefe's charges, who despite an initial loss on Friday night won against the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season - the first three matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaul's assist. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10 minutes Sullivan brought the home team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when at the end of the first period he scored his second goal that evening.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the score with a goal scored during the game in the lead at 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second period, Cowie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen give Dundee the first advantage of the match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the final period by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants, who have lost four games in their last five games, will play their next game at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Dies, Helping Hundreds of People on Plane Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died, helping to safely take off the plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many have been reported missing after a major earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many people have been trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan in Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The national disaster relief agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the death toll continues to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” said a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The tsunami, which reached six meters, destroyed Palu, where the mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
Drinking water is running out.
Small shops are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and said: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini airlines report one person missing after plane crashes on lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, report that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to Saturday afternoon's data, they could not account for one man who was traveling in a fatal plane.
They said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats assisted in rescuing the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the crash, and the exact course of the crash is unknown.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, it fell out of the belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane approached very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the belted water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the cabin crew members panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The United States Navy reported that the rescue was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby to modernize the waterfront. With the help of an inflatable boat, they managed to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in plane crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini is not among them.
Analyst reconstructs events from the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors concluded presenting evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as a forensic expert on information analysis.
He described to the judges how, using mobile phone records, he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she was killed.
As reported by the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was from Chambers on a fateful evening.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed her contact information, as well as text messages and calls, from her phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said it was likely that the case would be referred to a jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with positive message.
According to Bristol-based group The High Breed, hip-hop today has moved away from original political content and social issues.
The band members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ text
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for firing her from a racist job after receiving an incorrectly addressed text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racists, comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail."
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was visibly dismayed when it was revealed that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had a feud on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to him, she mistakenly sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the blunder, she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that the warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was performing her duties poorly and was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and was then sent home by Uber.
She is now seeking compensation from the couple for an exemption of $350 a day multiplied by the six months for which she was originally employed with residency, although she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple refuted accusations of racism, claiming that the termination of the collaboration with Mrs Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Posto's husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you entrust your children to the person you hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail," Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to do something like that?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case in court is not yet over, the public quickly handed down a few sentences on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Book Publishers Feared Readers Won't Feel Tied to Talking Bear
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book’s release.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He claims that her father, who, before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book seems "sweet-bitter".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he added.
But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like you had a child who achieved something - you feel proud of him, although it is not your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success more or less that way.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn’t make it out,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep the heart going slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She had died some time before, and that was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit and wait, knowing that it was all unfolding.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was with other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the torments she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
My head was down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nad.
I felt she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from grieving women to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to dissuade others from wanting to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can use to get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed, and he took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said it could brighten up any room."
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and he was the one who found his brother when Tyler committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m still afraid of the domino effect.”
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner Mark shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling down, sad or anything,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was already in a complete hole. When the children opened the presents, he did not even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It tears a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get what he was asking for - a limited-time and limited-scope investigation - maybe we could achieve some unanimity," said Jeff Flake, adding that he fears the committee is "disintegrating" into opposing camps, leading to an impasse.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The election for Congress is in a few weeks - November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans lose them, the chances of electing a specific person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush had already picked up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is uncertain whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the stalemate and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year and 2,706 in 2011.
The key factors that have affected the situation are tighter controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953, according to authorities in Seoul.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back home.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations, which had previously stalled.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, which resulted in a general agreement to clear the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to work in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think if a woman had behaved this way, she would have been considered 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions - he almost screamed and lost his speech when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also clearly reprimanded the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on reputation" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that, according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to work on the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making those statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's removal from office if he received the nomination and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn’t just be sitting on the Supreme Court, he should be sitting on the court where he’s currently working,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would overrule some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person to court who expects us to say 'but it's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women must rule it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of pouring fury, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager at a company, and she said that she cries when she’s angry, too, but she came up with a way that when she gets upset and starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office was one time I started crying out of unspeakable rage. An elderly woman, a cool executive I’d always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and led me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you're screwed."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the limit, Patricia realized that she might actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates before the election, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a backlog of fundraising and promised herself that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She discovered then that some of her followers, who had given the men $1,000, had only $250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and address voters, not delegates, and rage at sexism - that a voice stuck in her throat.
“You’d think I’d had a nervous breakdown,” she recalls.
“You’d think I’d be sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what would be written on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
What are the benefits of an economic war between the United States and China?
The salvos starting an economic war between the US and China have been deafening, and although the battle is still ongoing, in the long run, the conflict between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on China’s key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, resulting in taxation on half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing has reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second economy is going to back down anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing down to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the trade war with the US could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to unleash economic chaos in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return
The government says Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met for refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods to return to the country voluntarily.
More than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe to seal victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not do well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the top position in the world rankings, lost two holes before the last hole against Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am so happy to have the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the team’s victory in Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles game on Sunday, with a score of 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud to have won against Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 result in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and was inferior only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had trouble finding treadmills all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by the American line-up, his captain, Jim Furyk, said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We pulled out.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.”
