Bosnians protest Croatia's plans for radioactive waste dump
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-western Bosnia in protest against neighboring Croatia's plans to dump some of its waste from the region's only nuclear power plant near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad demanded that Croatia abandon its plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosnians holding banners saying "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - Una needs us" said that a radioactive waste dump could threaten the Union river and the lives of about 250,000 residents.
We have to say no,
Miroslav Drljaca, Mayor of Novi Grad, told the crowd.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
The Krško power plant located in Slovenia, built in the 1980s, also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional landfills.
Croatian public broadcaster HRT said on Friday that it had not yet been decided whether to build the landfill on its own or pay for the storage of some of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Environment and Energy Minister Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a holistic solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from every side of the country’s ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find a different location in a part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why does Croatia claim that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?” asked Drljaca.
We can't let them humiliate us!

US Congress approves sale of 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The U.S. Congress has not objected to the purchase of 32 F-35 fighter jets for the statutory 15 days since the State Department approved the purchase, which means that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began.
The decision of the Congress, although it was not unexpected, is of great political importance.
“After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I don’t see any major obstacles,” said John V. Venable, senior defense policy counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned arms sales abroad 15 days before signing the agreement if the value of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to a NATO member country, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft - if this transaction is finally completed - will be the American armaments company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for F-35A fighters Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by the Minister of Defense Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland's bid was - without weapons and technical assistance - about $89.2 million.
As U.S. military experts who wanted to remain anonymous told PAP, such a price given in the initial negotiations was “the maximum price, much higher than the price that will be negotiated.”
"Prices are falling sharply, currently the price of one F-35 is below $80 million, much less than the cost of a Eurofighter, which does not have the same advantages as the F-35," Venable said.
PAP spokesmen expressed hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of American combat aircraft by Poland will be completed later this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction - i.e. offset - will be discussed directly with American F-35 fighter manufacturers.
What is the replacement band of Munchhausen, referred to in the series "The Election of Payton Hobart" on Netflix?
Caregivers and parents with this disorder pretend that their healthy child is eating sick.
Payton Hobart’s “Elections” is coming to Netflix today.
It tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first needs to become president of the student government in his high school.
Ryan Murphy, creator of American Horror Story and Glee, stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details to those who haven’t yet seen the show, it touches on the subject of the replacement syndrome, a mental illness that occurs in caregivers who act as if the healthy person they’re dealing with is afflicted with a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, for example, the syndrome of Munchhausen, which involves causing the symptoms of a given disease.
Munchhausen’s replacement syndrome involves simulating that a person in our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an invented and induced disease, and it is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it look like his or her child is sick.
What are the symptoms of the replacement syndrome?
Symptoms of the disease may vary, but the NHS points out the following examples:
Convincing medical staff that a child who looks healthy does not feel well.
Exaggerating or inventing symptoms.
Falsifying results to make a child ill, such as giving glucose to urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often do you have a replacement syndrome?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, since many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicated that there were 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people in more than two years.
What to do if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?
Please contact your local special services or call the NSPCC Child Protection Hotline at 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid school in Kaduna, evacuate 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Station raided Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal school, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Riga, Igabi Local Government Area, yesterday, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
Police said the children were in highly dehumanizing conditions. The school authorities deny this claim.
Shehu, a school preacher, said: “They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there with their parents’ permission.
Before the children were admitted to school, the parents signed the form.
Parents brought their children food every day and knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of all student food provided by the parents before the school closed.
This is not fair, as parents can attest to whether their children are in poor conditions, according to police.
He added that the previous Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of childcare, never had any objections.
He claimed that children study the Koran and nothing else.
However, Yakubu Sabo, a public relations officer at the Police Station, decided that after the state was handed over to the government, the children would join their parents.
“They were held in dehumanizing conditions in the name of surrendering or acquiring Quranic knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That’s why we’re researching the school to get to know its owner,” he added.
Foreign talents important for China’s development
Guangdong is a leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talent largely due to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Great Bay Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao, and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group interviewed seven expatriates aged 10 to 70 in Guangdong.
Yash, a Singaporean born in 2010 at the Asian Games in Guangzhou, said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and doing a PhD in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student at the Russian-Chinese university Shenzhen MSU-BIT said: “Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together we can create new ideas and new projects.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the USA started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over one million fans on Bilibili and Weibo.
She said she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that “teaching children is like putting on a jacket.
If you incorrectly turn on the first button, the rest will never go to its right place.
Chinese-American Henry Xiao believes that in the very center of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges in relation to new rules, government policies, and capital resources, and in particular talent.
Culinary producer Sean Choi from South Korea said that the cuisine of the Guangdong region is known all over the world and the introduction of the Guangdong "Nanta Show" was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler, Technical Director of Quality at Pearl River Pianos in Switzerland, believes that the secret to quality lies in doing simple work.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products and persistently strive for better results.
Poll: Poles want Banas to resign
Most Poles want Marian Banas, the head of the Supreme Audit Office, to resign, according to a Kantar poll for TVN.
When asked whether the head of NIK, Marian Banaś, should resign, 55% said yes, of which 34% indicated “definitely yes” and 21% “rather yes”.
The answer "I don't know/it's hard to say" was chosen by 26% of respondents, while 19% opposed the resignation - 8% said "definitely not", and 11% - "rather not".
The demands for Marian Banas to resign appeared after the broadcast of the reportage "Armoured Marian and the hotel for hours" in the "Superwizjer" program.
The material shows that the head of NIK was in the owner of the tenement house in Krakow, where the hotel was to operate for hours, and the gangsters leading it were to rent the tenement house for their activities at a price lower than the market price.
After the disclosure of the material, Banaś announced that on September 27 he would go on unpaid leave until the end of the inspection of his property statements conducted by the CBA.
Kantar telephone survey was conducted on 25-26 September 2019 on a nationwide representative sample of 1005 people over the age of 18.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
“I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda,” believes Tomasz Siemoniak.
Tomasz Siemoniak, deputy head of the Civic Platform, spoke to Polsat News about the scandal involving the head of NIK.
“This case is disqualifying for Marian Banas.
He can become the Minister of Culture for some entertainment matters, not the head of NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who is responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
“This is a very serious state crisis,” he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about Klaudia Jachira's candidacy.
“Antonio Macierewicz is on the PiS lists.
A man who didn't just say things, he did them.
He accused the former SKW bosses of spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why is no one calling for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the lists?" he asked.
“People younger than us have a different aesthetic.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that sometimes she exaggerates.
Let’s not make this a campaign problem,” he added.
Tourists after the collapse of the travel agency Neckermann Poland are planning to return to the country
As the office said, there was no need to bring tourists ahead of time.
"The Office successively pays for unpaid hotel seats from the insurance guarantee," it said.
On 25 September Neckermann Polska submitted a declaration of insolvency to the Marshal’s Office.
At the time of filing by the office, there were 3,600 tourists outside the country.
On Wednesday, a group of about 500 people returned to Poland, and on Thursday 230.
On Friday, another 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece are expected to return.
Tourists will fly to Katowice and Warsaw (in total, there will be five charter flights).
Some of them will return on scheduled flights.
Over the weekend, as planned, about 1,000 tourists should return to the country on vacation, among others in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy.
According to information provided by the Marshal’s Office of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, the travel agency sold about 20 thousand trips for the autumn-winter season.
“These customers of the travel agency should contact the insurer, Allianz Partners, directly,” the office recalled.
He added that "the situation of tourists who signaled problems in hotels at the moment seems to be stabilized, and the emerging incidents of expelling tourists from hotels have been mitigated together with the consular services."
Last Friday, Thomas Cook, the world’s largest and oldest travel agency, said it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100% of Neckermann Polska.
'Disgusting' Central Coast child rapist forced to look at victim in court
A costumed masked man grabbed a school-bound 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into thickets on the Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after his arrest, a search warrant was executed at his home, where officers retained a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges related to the attack and to three more involving the seduction and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked back, she saw how unexpectedly he had come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged, “Stop, stop, stop,” he grabbed her neck and forced her into a thicket.
The man said, “Silence, don’t shout.
Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her arms and legs with cable ties, and later tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30 a.m. without answering several texts and calls from colleagues.
His clothes were dirty, and he wore traces of grass and trees, and he claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the embankment.
A further trial of the man will take place on Tuesday.
Pope urges executives of tech companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executives of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of achievement in the digital field risks increasing social inequality if the common good is not ethically taken into account.
Pope Francis spoke at a conference in the Vatican attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered at a conference entitled “The Common Good in the Digital Age”.
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
Technological advances in the art of war and the future of work have been discussed, with machines playing an increasingly important role, as well as a case study investigating the Christchurch attack in New Zealand and decisions made by social media companies in connection with the spread of the video recording the massacre.
During a speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that thanks to the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers were spared dangerous and monotonous work.
He warned, however, that becoming increasingly dependent on robotic devices to make a profit is a risk of depriving people of dignity resulting from work.
“If technological progress were to become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress,” he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become the enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable retrogression to a kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the fittest.
The organizers of the conference expressed their hope to use the expertise of the participants and identify possible future advisors of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technologies.
Martin Odegaard, a player on loan from Real Madrid, euphoricizes fans with his impressive assistance.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assist on Mikel Oyarzabal's opening goal.
By winning 2-0 against Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La Liga table and continues their streak of being undefeated on their own pitch this season.
However, despite failing to score a single defeat this season in La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to a turbulent pre-season and public feud with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a boiling point when Real Madrid were humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal - some of them the Frenchman has plans for now, others not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays for the team.
However, it was Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, who caused a great stir, scoring an incredible assist in the La Liga match.
During Real Sociedad's match with Alaves, Martin Odegaard made an impressive assist with Mikel Oyarzabal's opening goal and Real Sociedad eventually won 3-0 in front of their own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right side, Martin Odegaard outmaneuvered the player from the opposite team by putting a net on him, and then sent an amazing pass on the centimeters between the two other players and his teammate was left only to put his foot in.
The second goal by Willian Jose and the third by the amazing Oyarzabal, this time with a penalty, secured a decisive victory for Imanola's charges before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the end of the game.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid as a mere 16-year-old in 2015, but struggled to live up to the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, Norwegian footballers finally feel confident on the pitch.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pawar's name in the case of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank fraud
Anna Hazare stated: “Sharad Pawar’s name was not on the list when this case was handed over to me.”
The social activist, Anna Hazare, was not surprised to learn that the name of Sharad Pawar, chairman of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, had appeared in connection with the multimillion-dollar fraud at Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank.
The investigative agency Executive Directorate, abbreviated ED, brought the case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar - former Deputy Chief Minister of the State of Maharashtra - and others in connection with the fraud.
The Executive Directorate's information report on the case, equivalent to the FIR police report, was filed by the central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a report by the FIR of the Mumbai police, which lists the names of former bank president Ajit Pawar and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was nowhere to be seen.
"How his name came up, who gave it, they're the only ones who know these things," Hazare said Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged connection to the scam.
Anna Hazare, Sharad Pawar's critic, expressed hope that the truth would come to light as a result of ED's detailed investigation into the fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption rally.
Sharad Pawar denies committing the criminal act and claims that he was in no way associated with the bank, as well as puts into question the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the Maharashtra Assembly elections scheduled for October 21.
The former Union minister assured that he would not yield to the majesty of Delhi, unambiguously referring to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Directorate as motivated by political considerations.
Busy day at SG.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to transport stolen items worth more than PLN 130,000 to Ukraine.
All events were recorded yesterday (26 September) in the direction of departure from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen was transporting an electric bicycle from Specialized.
SG officers, determining the legality of the origin of the object, contacted representatives of the German Police and quickly determined that a modern two-wheeler worth about PLN 10,000 was stolen on the territory of this country.
A few hours later also in Korczowa, border guards controlling a semi-trailer registered in France found interference in the VIN number field.
The driver of the truck was a citizen of Ukraine.
A semi-trailer worth about 30 thousand zlotys has been detained and will be subjected to detailed expertise to determine the original data.
On the other hand, at the border crossing in Medyka, SG officers foiled an attempt to export another stolen Can-am quad (prod. 2019).
The value of the vehicle transported on the lavette was estimated at PLN 75,000.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old citizen of Ukraine.
The Border Guard confirmed that just two weeks ago the quad was lost on the territory of Poland and is wanted all over Europe.
Medica also thwarted a "partial" attempt to export the stolen vehicle.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus driver was carrying body parts from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
Body parts worth about 15 thousand zlotys were retained.
South Africa: 20-year-old accused of murdering Ukzn student Sinethemba Ndlovu
As expected, the man arrested in connection with the murder of a student at KwaZulu-Natal University (UKZN), Sinethemba Ndlovu, will apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecution Authorities (KOŚ).
The defendant appeared in the town court in Msinga on Thursday on suspicion of murder.
KZN’s spokesperson, Natasha Kara, told News24 that the case was postponed until 2 October in connection with the application for bail.
She added that Stan would oppose the release of the defendant on bail.
According to KZN police spokesman, Inspector Thembeka Mbele, a 20-year-old accused arrested on Monday.
Earlier this week, police revealed that Ndlovu suffered stab wounds to his left armpit and stomach.
She is believed to have worked as a hostess on Saturday evening during Msing Diftkhan's automotive event.
In a statement released today, the organizers of the automotive event stated that, as suggested by preliminary reports, after the end of the event and the end of their shift, several hostesses remained in place to watch the music performances.
On the way, unfortunately, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later died in hospital," according to the statement.
On Friday, the U.K.N. suspended classes, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death require us, as a community, to pause and reflect on the fragility of life and the brutality that so often occurs in our society."
Mylan agrees to pay $30 million as part of EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million as part of a settlement over the failure to notify investors of a Justice Department investigation into a possible request for too much Medicaid for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that Mylan NV had qualified EpiPen as a “generic” medicine in its Medicaid reimbursement program.
Therefore, the pharmaceutical company provided the government with a much lower return on part of the price of the product than if EpiPen was classified as a “brand-name” drug.
In July, Mylan revealed that it had reached an agreement on the rules with the KPWiG on this issue.
In its statement on Friday, the company said it did not confirm or deny the allegations of the KPWiG.
Is this God’s punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, death of a child.
These are dramas that cause a lot of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We ask, “Why?”
Sometimes we hear, “God wants it that way.”
Is it the Creator who brings us misery and disease?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life.
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father ran out of the room in horror.
“My son has no arms or legs!” he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child suffered from an incurable disease that deprived them of limbs.
At first, they couldn’t accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick’s mom felt that God had a plan for their baby.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelizer and motivational speaker, thanks to whom many people are converted.
“I’m proof that God is never wrong,” Nick says.
“When suffering touches us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask, “Why did this happen to us?”
If we believe that God rules over the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises whether He has sent us a disease, a misfortune.
Mother pleads guilty to murdering two teenage sons
The woman burst into tears when she was told she could spend the rest of her life in prison after confessing to murdering her two teenage sons and planning to kill the other four of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, confessed to the murders of Tristan Barrass (13 years old) and Blake Barrass (14 years old).
The brothers died 12 minutes apart in the hospital after police were called to the Shiregreen district in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, around 7:30 a.m. on 24 May.
Autopsies were performed, however, during Friday's hearing at the Crown Court in Sheffield, the results of the autopsy were not given.
The exact circumstances of the boys' deaths are not yet known.
Barrass appeared on the dock with co-defendant Brandon Machine, 39, a family member.
Surrounded by three guards, they pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and one count of planning the murder of six children.
During the 20-minute hearing, the couple also pleaded guilty to five counts of attempted murder.
The allegation of planning the killing refers to the period between May 14 and May 20.
Four of the charges of attempted murder on May 23 involve four children, including Blake and Tristan.
The fifth attempted murder occurred on May 24.
All of the surviving children are under 13 years old.
The Queen’s adviser, Judge Jeremy Richardson, told the couple: “I will never be able to fully express in words what shameful deeds you have done.
The crimes you've committed speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
Attempted murder of four children and conspiracy to kill them.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be sentenced to several life sentences at the appropriate time."
The judge will determine whether it will be a sentence of absolute imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
The verdict will be handed down on November 12.
MP Krzysztof Brejza sues Cezary Gmyz
“I am suing Cezary Gmyz in connection with the campaign of lies written by TV,” MP Krzysztof Brejza said on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement of the publicist Cezary Gmyz in the "Gone 20" program on TVP.
One of the leading people in charge of SokiemzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has extensive experience in organizing the hate department.
"People who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda - the founder of the "hetero" profile - are Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych," said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social networking sites and profiles with memes and jokes related to politics.
According to "Networks", behind the profile with this title stands the PR-sheep Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda.
“We were able to find out that since April this year Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw city office, in the marketing office,” the weekly wrote.
"Confederation" in Oława
At the market square in Oława, the “Confederation” election committee organized its meeting.
Krzysztof Szokalski presented his program number 5 on the list, and Halszka Bielecka number 9.
The announced leader of the list Krzysztof Tuduj did not make it to the election rally.
The candidates raised a number of issues ranging from excessive state fiscalism to health care problems.
The issue of the economic zone was also raised, which should work for all entrepreneurs and not favour foreign capital.
Climate Strike in Budapest - The World
Several thousand people, mostly young people, took part in a climate strike in the Hungarian capital of Budapest on Friday.
The government was urged to pursue climate neutrality, declare a climate emergency, and pursue a greener policy.
The strikers went from Clark Square on the Buda side to Kossutha Square in front of the parliament on the Pest side.
They chanted, “What do we want?
Climate protection!
When do we want?
Now!".
Boris Johnson addressed to police watchdog over close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC, an independent police investigation agency, will investigate the possibility of an investigation being opened against the Prime Minister to determine whether he has committed a criminal act of abuse in his capacity as Mayor of London.
The Greater London Council (GLA) said in a statement that its oversight inspector had registered "a matter related to the Prime Minister's conduct" in connection with allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri due to their close acquaintance.
“The ‘proceedings issue’ can be discussed when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime,” he said.
This does not mean that it has been proven in any way.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate the matter.
The matter was referred to the IOPC, which handles complaints against members of the police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police watchdog because Johnson was then the equivalent of a police commissioner and a criminal commissioner.
Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
He had previously said he would comply with a London City Council order and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted the council was "focusing on the wrong issue".
The order follows reports by The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, had received 126,000 pounds of budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions headed by then-Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to Arcuri-owned Hacker House until the case is resolved.
The government is waiting for troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds were allocated.
Digital Minister Matt Warman told the House of Commons his department’s staff had “usually taken due care” and that the company had a UK phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were routed to an office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently expected to live.
The prime minister’s close relationship with the businesswoman “was a secret for the staff.”
The GLA's decision to refer the prime minister to the IOPC's independent police investigation office was met with displeasure at 10 Downing Street.
According to a senior government official, it is a “politically motivated attack” and its timing, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference, is “overtly political.”
"The inspector did not provide any evidence to support the allegations and the prime minister was not given a chance to respond before the press release was released late on Friday," the source said.
Neither the public nor the media will be fooled by such an overtly political set-up.
Earlier today, The Standard was told that Johnson’s close relationship with a Californian businesswoman, helped by the Tourism and Promotion Agency in London, was a “mystery” for employees.
The former senior staff of London & Partners (L&P) recalled that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's overseas business trips as mayor despite the fact that her companies were not considered "credible" at the time.
Third accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the death of rapper Mac Miller last year as a result of a drug overdose.
According to court documents, Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit fentanyl-treated oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol, and fentanyl, the powerful opioid responsible for the “epidemic” that claimed several thousand lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed Tuesday reveal Pettit was receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of acting as Walter’s “courier” who supplied the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly charged with causing Miller's death, and none of them provided a line of defense in their case.
Walter, who is on parole in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violating his release conditions.
Prosecutors on the case, which was first reported on Thursday by the TMZ celebrity website, are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, saying there is a serious risk of the defendant escaping.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer’s answering machine didn’t come right away.
Pettit was charged in federal court on September 4, and his defense attorney declined to comment.
Miller's rhyming lyrics are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of some of hip-hop's biggest stars.
Originally from Pittsburgh, Miller, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was in a relationship with singer Ariana Grande for two years ending earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she posted a touching video featuring Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and his body was found to contain fentanyl and hydrocodone.
The correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
The 9-year-old creates a hide and seek game using the free Scratch 2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player earns a point each time he catches a bat that comes out of hiding.
I learned to create games on an accelerated course.
“Now I create them when I’m bored,” Basil told CNN.
In March, Dad enrolled him in a five-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was designed to provide children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and he received a bura for devoting all his time to games.
“One day he was playing on a tablet, as usual, and he was so engrossed in it that I got upset,” the father said.
Out of anger, I said, “You’re just playing, can’t you think about making your own games so others can play them?”
When I said those words, I was upset and I didn’t think he would take them seriously,” he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning how to make his own games, getting his parents to buy a laptop and enroll him in a course during which he learned the basics of making games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his games titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in the Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were lauded for using codes to create robots to divide their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghana’s secondary school won the 2019 Robofest competition for programming crates stacking robots.
And with the growing investments of tech giants like Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers are well on their way to becoming coding stars.
Former North Carolina Republican Leader Admits to Lying About Corruption
The court documents filed on Friday show that the former chairman of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of a major political donor.
According to the jury, Robin Hayes is due to plead guilty next Wednesday.
A document containing the factual basis, prepared as part of a plea bargain and signed by Hayes' lawyer, shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The plea bargain has been sealed, and there is no basis on which Hayes will plead guilty.
He was initially charged with conspiracy, corruption and making false statements.
Prosecutors have accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in an insurance company’s plan to direct campaign donations to the country’s top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were charged with attempting to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, having been one of the state's major political donors in recent years, having donated more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mostly supported the Republican Party's goals and politicians, but he also donated to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday’s email asking for a comment.
Defense attorney Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's email asking for a comment.
According to court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about state Department of Insurance employees.
According to the document containing the factual basis, Hayes actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors say Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Causey and that he discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million to Causey's 2020 re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, the collusion also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg's company.
A Republican, Causey reported the alleged corruption attempt to federal agents and helped them gather evidence in the case.
No charges were filed against him.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to donate $250,000 to Causey's campaign during a conversation in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
In the course of the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such an amount of money would attract attention, but, as evidenced by the accusation, eventually gave way.
“Whatever you all want to do, we will do,” Hayes said.
“Okay, I’ll take care of it.”
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor did not respond to an email asking for further information about the settlement.
The drivers will drive the first episode of the new cemetery
From Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first of three built mountain sections of the S7 expressway, i.e. the new Zakopianka - from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and further the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
Iwona Mikrut, spokeswoman for the Kraków branch of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), said on Friday that this is the first of three sections of the S7 to be built south of Krakow, from Lubno to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into use.
From more than 6 km from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka, more than a third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, it was driven on viaducts.
Seventeen of them were created, including the longest and highest, counting a kilometer in length and 50 m in height, and four small objects on the watercourses at the Skomielna junction.
From this junction there were exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to the national road No. 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next junction, Zabornia, you can take the DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and the DK7 to Chyżny and the state border with Slovakia.
On Zbójecká Góra, a place of service for ILO travellers was established.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia junction in Rabka Zdrój, to which the approximately kilometre long two-way section of the DK47 has been added to Chabówka and there it has been incorporated into the already existing two-way Chabówka - Rdzawka.
The S7 Skomielna Biała - Radka Zdrój section and the new section of the national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka were built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment amounted to approximately PLN 615 million.
The guarantee of the quality of the work carried out will be valid for 10 years.
The 16.7 km fragment of the new Zakopane, including 15.8 km of the parameters of the expressway, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień - Repair, Repair - Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała - Rabka Zdrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is made by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section - the Italian company Astaldi, and the third - the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, viaducts, flyovers) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km are being built throughout this section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, this year will be available 7.6-kilometer section of Lubień - Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which drivers will bypass the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair - Skomielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, drivers will drive in 2021, after the completion of the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of each thread of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is a welfare state.
“We are building a welfare state in Poland,” Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said.
He came to Szczecin to persuade to vote for Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
“The program of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the welfare state,” the minister said.
“We want Poles to earn much better, so that their lives are at a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented the program that it pledged to implement four years ago.
We said we would introduce a 500 plus program.
Platforma, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said that it is impossible that this money simply does not exist.
We have proven that the money is and was, only AFTER it did not care about those to whom it was supposed to go."
Ziobro also reminded about the children's outfit and the thirteenth pension - and about the fact that the fourteenth pension is also planned.
In addition to the “discreet distribution of national income”, PiS’ priorities are a fair state and economic development.
The money should not go to the pockets of the chosen ones, who have a good relationship with the establishment and the government, but it should go to the whole society evenly.
Emmanuel Macron pays tribute to Jacques Chirac
French President Emmanuel Macron said goodbye on Thursday in a televised speech by his predecessor Jacques Chirac; he called him a great Frenchman and a great statesman.
At 9 p.m., the Eiffel Tower lights went out in tribute to the former president.
Former French President and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac died Thursday morning at the age of 86.
Macron’s farewell speech was broadcast on all the major French television channels.
"He was the statesman we loved, just as he loved us," the president said.
“More than 40 years in politics have brought Chirac’s face close to ours.
And whether we shared his ideals or his battles or not, we all recognized ourselves in this man.
Tonight is a night of gratitude to Jacques Chirac.
He has done so much for the nation, for our values, for our fraternity and for our tolerance,” Macron continued.
Chirac opposed the 2003 war with Iraq, which did not have a UN mandate, and sought peace in the Balkans, stability and peace in Lebanon.
Before the TV appearance, Macron went to Chirac's Paris apartment on de Tournon Street.
At noon, the National Assembly celebrated the former president's passing with a minute's silence.
The Elysée Palace will be open from 9 p.m. on Thursday to Sunday evening for all those who wish to sign the book of condolences.
"The President of the Republic wishes the French people to be able to pay tribute to Jacques Chirac, who passed away today," the press service of the Elysee Palace said.
The palace was the home of Chirac for two presidential terms from 1995 to 2007.
President Macron declared Monday a day of national mourning.
At noon, a solemn mass will be celebrated in the Church of St. Sulpicius, and the official service, according to tradition, will be held in the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which has been closed to the public since April, when the fire broke out there.
Jacques Chirac's funeral will take place next week; the exact date and details are not yet known.
Part of Sopocka Street in Nisko already after expansion
On Tuesday, 24 September, the expanded Sopocka Street in Nisko was ceremonially put into operation.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 803 thousand, of which PLN 26 thousand was co-financing from the FDS, while the remaining amount was own contribution from the funds of the Niża County and the Municipality and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the acquired means, it was possible to make, among others, the surface over a length of 1284 meters with its extension, a sidewalk over a section of 950 meters, dehydration and finishing works.
The contractor of the investment was the Consortium of companies: PBI Infrastruktura S.A. Z Kraśnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. z Sandomierz.
At the turn of the year 2019/2020, the district will carry out a further stage of the development of Sopocka Street, within which a new pavement, pavement and a bridge on the Barcówka River will be constructed.
For the implementation of these works, the county authorities also managed to obtain funding from the FDS, at the level of 80% of the value of the entire investment.
The ceremonial handover of the reconstructed road was attended by: Robert Bednarz, the mayor of Nižany, Adam Mach, the chairman of the Nižany County Council Sylwester Daśko, the chairman of the Board of Malce Estate Jan Bielak, employees of the District Starosty and the District Roads Board in Nisko, the contractor of the investment and the supervisor.
Facebook with concern for the well-being of users will hide the counter of likes on trial
As part of the world’s first-ever experiment to improve user experience, some Facebook users will soon not see likes, reactions, and video views on other people’s posts.
Likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook launched this Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Facebook’s privacy director in Australia, said the change is the result of a survey of mental health professionals’ well-being and opinions indicating that the likes counter may prompt comparisons with others.
“The response from our many anti-harassment groups and mental health organizations has been really positive,” Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of their content, rather than the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and not perceived as a competition,” she said.
Garlick said companies that base their businesses on Facebook will continue to receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
She said it was too early to say whether the test would be extended to other countries, as it was with Instagram when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were included in the test.
As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication as to when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made permanently.
“Preliminary user comments on the new Instagram rules have been positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to feedback,” she said.
Commenting on the site of the global experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically savvy Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe this is an amazing country that will provide us with authoritative opinions indicating whether a new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the Curia
Częstochowa Curia does not comment on the appeal of the councillors to the local Metropolitan Archbishop Wacław Depo for financial compensation for handling waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city asks for 1 PLN from the pilgrim.
On Friday, he spoke about the speech addressed to the Metropolitan at a press conference with the participation of, among others, the Spring leader Robert Biedron, organized on the Częstochowa Avenue leading to Jasna Góra, the Vice-Chairman of the local city council and a candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
Kot informed that the day before the local councilors of the SLD voted an appeal to Archbishop Wacław Depo to give the city one zloty from each pilgrim visiting Częstochowa - to support the work of municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up after the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
“We ask you to donate to the city budget a symbolic zloty from each pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions of stay in Częstochowa," said the vice-chairman of the city council.
Mariusz Bakalarz, a spokesman for the Częstochowa Metropolitan Curia, initially prepared a few-pronged response, but then asked - as he signalled, at the request of Archbishop Depo - to replace it with the information: "Until we receive the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the matter".
According to the draft published on the Częstochowa City Hall website, the appeal to Archbishop Depo concerns “the provision of financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season”.
“Due to the growing number of pilgrims coming to Częstochowa and the increasing costs of servicing the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the image of the city among residents, pilgrims and pilgrims, we would like to propose, within the framework of generally accepted canons, taking care of our common good, the small homeland of Częstochowa, participation in the costs of servicing in the system.
“In order to maintain the cleanliness of the pedestrian-ridden routes used by pilgrims, who simultaneously use a small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bins, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 per pilgrim,” it said.
“In addition, due to the participation in the annual costs, which the city will cover with its own funds, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and wishing to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the above amount will be allocated to improving the tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available to the public,” the councillors declared.
They pointed out that in addition to financial issues, their proposal results from numerous objections raised by residents as to the state of cleanliness of the routes on which pilgrims travel.
“Taking into account the care for the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council of Częstochowa appeals to the Archbishop of Częstochowa, Wacław Depo, to provide financial compensation for the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season,” the appeal reads.
According to the press office of Jasna Góra, in the entire last year, there were 834,000 people participating in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this shrine.
About 124,000 faithful came in 255 pilgrimages.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups - on roller skates.
"News" TVP omitted the Confederation in the description of the survey
According to Pollster’s poll, PiS would get 45% of the vote in the elections to the Sejm, KO 26%, Left 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
It was even reported on the Super Express website for which the probe was conducted.
In the main issue of News, describing the same survey, the results of only the first four parties were presented, quite apart from the Confederation.
The leader, Edyta Lewandowska, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also shown the distribution of parliamentary mandates without taking into account the votes cast for the Confederation.
That would give them self-governing power.
Krzysztof Bosak, commenting on the whole situation, spoke of “public embarrassment in the matter of honesty towards society”.
“They started with the slogans of the ‘moral revolution,’” he recalled, adding that the matter was a sign of a sense of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "'News TVP' in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrasses Urban and Michnik".
He also noted the lack of response from right-wing journalists.
“But let us also look at those who are silent.
Those who are “righteous”, “independent”, “unhumble”.
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they were supposed to be fighting,” he added.
Małgorzata Motylow Vice-President of NIK
On Thursday, 26 September, the Marshal of the Sejm Elżbieta Witek handed Małgorzata Motylow the act of appointment to the position of Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office with effect from 27 September 2019.
“In accordance with Article 21(1) of the Act on the Supreme Chamber of Control of Vice-Presidents, the NIK appoints and dismisses the Marshal of the Sejm, after consulting the competent Sejm committee, at the request of the President of NIK,” reads the statement.
The proposal in this case was received by the Marshal of the Sejm on 24 September 2019.
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Sejm, it was addressed to the Sejm Committee on State Control, which on 26 September this year gave a positive opinion" - recalls the statement.
“On 26 September 2019, Ewa Polkowska, Wojciech Kutyła and Mieczysław Łuczak were also dismissed from their positions as Vice-Presidents of NIK,” reads the statement.
Earlier that day, requests for all these personnel decisions were positively received by the Sejm Committee on State Control, except that the vote on the opinion until the dismissal of Ewa Polkowska was carried out twice - in the first vote on the committee the same number of deputies was for and against.
The new vice-president of NIK Małgorzata Motylow comes from Chełm Lubelski.
Brother Sentenced to Life for Killing Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos posted on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most notorious “honor killing” in the patriarchal country.
Baloch, who rose to fame by posting bold selfies - polite by Western standards but considered provocative in a highly misogynistic Pakistan - was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and declared that he had "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in prison in a long-awaited sentence.
“Inshallah (God willing) will be acquitted by a higher court,” he said.
Baloch’s mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
“He is innocent.
“She was my daughter, and this is my son,” she said.
The murder of Baloch has made headlines around the world and has renewed calls for action against the so-called honor killing epidemic, in which victims - usually women - are killed for breaking patriarchal social rules.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for crimes such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, bringing their family “shame” by manifesting their own sexuality.
Murders are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistan’s law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask forgiveness from their immediate victims.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation introducing a life sentence for honor killings.
However, whether a murder is considered an honor crime remains the responsibility of the judge, which means that the murderers can theoretically invoke a different motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first insisted that their son should not be shown favor under any circumstances.
However, crushed by the thought that they might lose him, they changed their minds and declared that they wanted his acquittal.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself an heir along with the parents, thus forcing the case forward.
One of Baloch's more well-known accomplishments is offering to do a striptease in front of a Pakistani cricket team and putting on a cleavage purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as breaking through restrictions in a country where posing as a Kim Kardashian-like figure could be considered a bold and political movement to empower women.
The roots of the "honourable" killing lie in the tribal social norms that still dominate South Asia, and in particular, they normalize the behavior of women, although men can also be victims.

Start of the competition at 10.30.
The regattas will be held in Omega and Optimist classes in match racing formula.

“Hope” has been singing for 10 years.
The band of singers “Hope” operating at the Wheel of Country Housewives in Rachanie celebrated its 10th anniversary on 21 September.
The manager and accompanist of the team is Stanisław Seńko, director of GOK in Rachanie.
The group takes part in competitions, reviews, patriotic and religious celebrations, festivals and harvests.
The band members sing with three voices.
The ceremonial meeting on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the team, organized by the Municipal Cultural Centre in Rachanie, was attended by Katarzyna Gucz - the incumbent member of the Management Board of the Tomaszów County, Teresa Semczyszyn - vice-chairman of the District Council, who is also the vocalist of the team and Anna Romanowicz-Łagowska, the director of Tomasz Zieński's parliamentary office.
Anarchy doubles the number of displaced people from northwestern Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said increasing violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwestern Nigeria to about 40,000 over the past four months.
The UN refugee agency said the unrest created a “new emergency humanitarian situation” that requires an interagency effort to raise $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been leading an uprising in the north of the country for a decade, was not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsin over the past 10 months is rather the result of the actions of organized armed groups.
“This paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and uncertainty,” he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, extortion, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.
The army and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is being pulled away from the fighting with Boko Haram and a branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which emerged from its former grouping in 2016.
“Refugees don’t come with group names,” he said.
They come with horrible stories.
Most of the refugees arrive in neighbouring Niger.
In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said he expected more people to flock to Niger in the coming months as the security situation worsened, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of a man accused of killing a woman and two children.
A new trial date has been set for a Guatemalan man accused of killing an Iowa woman and her two children.
According to Polk County District Court records, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under what authorities say is a false name he originally gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
Police say he fatally shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.
The court records show that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of a cabinet revolt to lower Brexit demands and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister, there are growing fears that he will not have enough time to make major concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a revolt from the cabinet, which wants to lower demands in connection with Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Negotiations have stalled on a new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has described proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unfeasible".
The Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, headed by Germany’s Angela Merkel, to offer a compromise at the last minute to the criticised Tory leader in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the Tory annual conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand that the prime minister denounce the “aggressive” strategy developed by his close advisor, Dominik Cummings, consisting in attempts to bluff the EU and threaten to leave the EU without a deal, and then accept the last-minute offer made by the EU.
One cabinet minister described the Supreme Court’s devastating verdict on Tuesday on ending the parliament’s suspension as a “warning signal” and added: “The only way for us to leave the European Union on October 31st is to do so on the basis of a deal.
We will never beat the arithmetic in the House of Commons that works against us.
The Prime Minister must now bow down and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness doesn’t pay off: it’s obvious that Cummings’ plan has failed.
We cannot fight on so many fronts.
A second cabinet minister has pledged to tell Johnson to try to push through former Prime Minister Theresa May's deal if all else fails.
The minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the prime minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House of Commons.”
There are many chances to vote for it, and everyone is very interested in ending this topic.
If we are forced to extend the deadline, it will be the end of Boris Johnson and the end of us all.
John Major has accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a snarling speech, the former Tory prime minister said: “The prime minister tells us he wants a deal with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he wrestles the bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales, and argues with the citizens on the main streets of the cities - all before the eyes of the world, as if the election campaign is already well underway."
A spokesman for the current prime minister admitted yesterday that the deal is still a long way off, adding: “No one should have any illusions: there is a very long way to go to secure the deal.”
However, a spokesman also said the Benn Act, which puts a three-month delay to Brexit if no deal is reached, “actively weakens our negotiating position” in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will hold more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how Ireland’s food and living zone works.
A dog without a nose and legs conquers Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The mutt was to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
She was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
A photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal at first sight.
“Initially, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs,” she said.
She decided to take care of the dog until someone adopted her.
But still no one came forward.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and in need of love,” Kate said.
Eventually, the couple decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn’t like the way she looks, that’s her problem, not ours,” she said.
Over time, Bonnie has become a social media star.
More than 14,000 people follow her on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, the heads of television said that due to the Glasgow accent "she will never make a career" as a presenter.
Reminiscing about her 35-year career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that she felt "a lot of nervousness" before her first appearance on screen.
“I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous,” she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and information specialist, the chief executive said that my Glasgow accent would never make me successful on television.
I went to London to meet the whole TV-am team and watch the broadcast of the show before I took over my duties in the Glasgow office.
I will never forget the interview with star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before becoming a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, Kelly began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then began running programs such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak", and later launched her morning show "Lorraine", which took its name from her.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be celebrated with a special program, during which she will remember her best moments and interviews.
She said the secret to her long tenure on television was “passion and enthusiasm” and “curiosity,” adding: “You have to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was "very difficult" for her to report on the Dunblane bombing.
I had no idea that many families of dead or injured children were watching our show live from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked in her house for many hours.
The whole meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, which I attended.
She added that it was "extremely difficult" to interview Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that she "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don’t know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they have to endure the most horrible comments from online trolls.
I am with them with all my heart.
Lorraine Kelly’s 35th anniversary show on TV will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30 on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared imprisonment
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga had rejected an offer made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the peak of the coup because he feared imprisonment to confirm the takeover by the military in November 2017.
As The Zimbabwe Independent reported last week, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of a coup.
However, a senior government official said on social media that Chiwenga had not turned down the offer out of fear, but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost in the coup.
In a Twitter thread that confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga rather than President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom state officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that intense negotiations were underway at the time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was slipping out of his hands.
Mediation between the military authorities and the deceased former president had, according to a senior state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations was President George Charamba's spokesman, then acting head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera, and a cleric representing Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to hand over an offer to the presidency to Chiwendze, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
The man, who was considered an icon of Africa after his death even more than during his life, tried in vain to get the UA to condemn military actions, trying to persuade other African leaders to intervene.
The president's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defense Force (SSO) Chiwendze, was not a choice.
“It was a desperate act to save a situation that gained dangerously fast momentum by removing a part of the deceased’s family,” the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a bit of political temptation, with the help of which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-diplomatic way.
Suffice it to recall that the commanders declared that they had not overthrown and would not overthrow the constitutional order, which would have caused their conflict with the AU position on coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly breaking the leaders' claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and the way to fit it into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, so a call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in this spirit and with such calculation that this offer was made.
Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning a powerful man that he was risking a Gaddafi-style lynching.
The military chiefs told him they would not return the rifles against the citizens if they moved on to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires: to save his family and to prove that the military had taken power," the official added.
The then SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The messenger (Gono) carrying this desperate message was given to understand, through a powerful metaphor, that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we do not compete with each other on a political level, a senior state official claimed.
State officials say the military notified military commanders in the area through an attaché who was in Zimbabwe that they had no intention of overthrowing Mugabe, but rather dealing with the "criminals" surrounding him.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to tempt Mnangagwa again to return from a brief exile in South Africa so that they could talk about a coup and succession.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, which is a key element of the process - not only because of its economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that the then president Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc - refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the military invaded Mugabe's house, as it repeatedly threatened in the background, the troops of South Africa would immediately arrive in Harare.
“It didn’t work because Putin and the African leaders didn’t choose this route,” an insider told The Independent.
China needs strong leadership or will ‘break up’ as policy paper says
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, or else the country will “disintegrate,” the government said in a policy paper released Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office said in a white paper that the country’s successes since the Communists took power 70 years ago come down to the party’s leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, but there are rarely any difficulties in administration.
The document mentions that without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used a hard-line policy to solve problems, as in the case of suppressing the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who will lead the celebration of the world’s second-largest economy on Tuesday, has tightened party rule and imposed sanctions on those who may challenge power since taking office in late 2012.
Xi also oversees a military modernization program that has upset the region.
China does not seek to export its development model, nor does it want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not “hegemony.”
The Chinese do not have in their genes the conquest of other nations or the domination of the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and unrest have left a deep mark on them as a result of their sufferings; China will never inflict on others the sufferings they themselves have suffered.
China is celebrating this anniversary at an uncertain time for a country embroiled in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in subjugated Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never “trade” its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country’s trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that “the danger of trade wars and a further increase in tariffs do not lead to a solution to the problems.”
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a broad market place, and a strong economic growth rate.
The document added that “trade wars will never weaken it.”
China is certain that it will be able to face the difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It added that the United States should look at China's development rationally, as China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that it will stop China’s development.
Reducing and weakening other countries and transferring domestic misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
The World of Jacek Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the real face
The Dubai Emirate is a place still searching for its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, Islamic religious radicalism and the extremism of progressiveness.
This trend-setting global tourism leader stirs up imagination and desire, fantasizing about the vanity of wealthy snobbish hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and traders with tax haven status.
Websites infect with enthusiasm to this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentrate of 21st century architecture in one.
Created on oil-rich sands, the emirate has become Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many admire the omnipresent splendor, appreciate creative hyperactivity and hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto says it all: “surprise, bewilder and enchant”.
And that at almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, “the metropolis has taken on a dimension of tawdry grotesqueness, full of extremes and contradictions.”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, the emirate’s unofficial constitution.
Because here everything has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
Among the thickets of excesses and ostentatious excess, however, something is missing that in old Europe is perhaps not transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
Certainly not in Dubai.
Fleeing the world of magic, I tore off its golden mask, revealing the other face of an artificial paradise.
A face that is not spoken or written about.
I show the misery of the Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine caste of ethnic Dubaians, the grandchildren of the illiterate Bedouins.
I venture into places of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where an army of Asian workers lives in cruel conditions.
They were the ones who in one generation built the desert Manhattan in slave conditions.
They came here deceived by good wages and the possibility of ensuring a decent life for their families, and found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
Increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labor a highly troublesome one for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls banned from talking about diets in her home after her struggles with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls admitted that she was banned from dieting in her home after she struggled with eating disorders for years, eating only fruits and vegetables.
For years, Spice had not eaten enough and had been “obsessed with exercise” as a result of the pressure of being a member of a world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences influence how she raises her daughter, Scarlet, which is why she “doesn’t allow diets to be talked about in her home.”
“Scarlet is now 10 years old and I’m starting to see that she’s more aware of her appearance,” Mel said.
“I think one of the positives of having an eating disorder is that I’m very aware of the way I talk to it.
The use of positive language has now become a habit of mine.
In an interview with Women's Health magazine, Mel, who rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls, said that in the days before the rise of social media, the "outrageous" comments about her caused her complexes.
“I started to look at myself the wrong way, giving up certain food groups, exercising more and more obsessively, until I started to be underweight,” she says.
“I was sick and it probably took a few years.”
The photo that shocked the world
A Polish girl and an American documentary filmmaker gave a testimony to the world about the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk
“Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!” began Julien Bryan, a documentary filmmaker and photographer.
On the tragic September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His story has had a wide resonance in the West.
The president of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the U.S., deposited it in the embassy safe, and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever the Varsovians were.
400 aircraft and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan photographed death, suffering, and the struggle for survival in the ruins of the city.
Just before the capitulation, he and the embassy staff took the negatives overseas.
He didn’t stop talking about Hitler’s crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles were viewed by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
“Dad was showing the truth and fighting German propaganda in this way.
They made films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Trial before a jury against a former athlete accused of multiple rapes
A jury is hearing a rape case against a former University of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, members of the jury proceeded to decide the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who turned 21 says Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The incident occurred three weeks after the two met on Bumble's meeting page and sent the woman a picture of themselves naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway of sexual assault between 2013 and 2018.
Prosecutors said the hugs the woman had agreed to had turned into rape, which she objected to.
Defenders cite the woman's conflicting relationships and memory gaps, and say the woman probably regretted the intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
Gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be seen at the jubilee, 10th edition of the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
Its designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, has just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
An unusual model made a sensation at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under it is the highest quality silver.
This is an unusual coating made by my colleague from Żor.
“There’s a saddle, there’s pedals, there’s a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It’s an electric bike,” says the designer.
“The bike’s body was printed on a 3D printer.
These are cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model while riding my first bike home, a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years,” adds Adam Zdanowicz.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
Inside are batteries, wires, elements that make up the structure.
It is hidden under the bodywork inserted in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
The engine is also hidden there.
The handlebar for this bike was created a week before my departure to the United States for the World Bicycle Show.
I couldn’t decide what the steering wheel would be like.
It consists of transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilos,” he concludes.
The gold-plated bike was appreciated in Las Vegas by the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom bike".
Video footage shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Surrounded by the Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge, Sydney Bay makes a significant contribution of $21.9 billion, pumped into the Australian economy every year by visitors to Sydney.
But there is an ugly truth under the bridge.
Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, which is affected by a volume of pollution equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic swimming pools every year.
These horrifying statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions one of our dirtiest.
According to a new video entitled "Sydney Bay - Up and Down", the waters around Australia's most popular city are full of cigarette butts, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all draining into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest component that suffocates our shipping channels is plastic.
“I would call it a paradox,” said Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a September 27 video, which coincides with World Tourism Day.
This area looks beautiful, but it is one of the most changed and polluted estuaries along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that about 1,560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it enters the bay through storm drains.
“After such a massive fallout, the bay... it looks pretty tragic,” Dr. Dafforn said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious below the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
“For me, unless you spend time underwater, you can’t really realize what’s down there,” said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Manly Dive Centre, noting that he and his team independently extract about 500 kg of plastic from the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water), they'd just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom is plastic mesh.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all this other garbage is being mined just below the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways that people, both locals and tourists, could help reduce the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
“It has to start at the source,” he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better manage the recovery of materials, and be more aware of what we discharge in the wastewater that ultimately ends up in the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we are doomed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of our carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can tidy up this bay and restore it to its former glory, and this is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film, funded by the recycling company TOMRA as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians on the environment and reduce the negative impact of beverage containers that often end up in the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 found that 82% of respondents feel helpless against plastic waste and 25% blame adults for the problem of waste from single-use plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern of parents, with 93% of 551 parents surveyed saying they were growing concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don’t know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland - Slovenia.
Memes after the volleyball match in the semi-finals ME
It was not an easy match.
The Slovenes had a lively audience on their side, which effectively distracted the Polish volleyball players.
There was also a lot of controversy among the judges, who in one of the actions did not count four rebounds on the side of the hosts.
This happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen’s charges had a chance to rebound and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles eventually had to recognize the superiority of a rival who, after winning 3:1, will play in the final of the tournament.
Ghana: Kaneshie Merchants Support Accra Psychiatric Hospital
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated 30,000 GH worth of food yesterday to a psychiatric hospital in Accra during a brief ceremony held in Accra.
This is part of the Kaneshie Market Complex’s 40th anniversary celebrations.
The donation included, among others, various food items, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, yams, paradise bananas, cassava and water bags.
During the visit, the group also spoke with several patients of the facility.
The event was attended by members of the management staff of Accra Markets Limited, the directors of the association and the queens of the mother.
Presenting the items, Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, president of the Women’s Association of the Greater Accra Region Market, said the donation was part of the group’s regular social responsibility charity work.
She noted that the facility's patient care support was necessary to show them love and let them feel part of society.
Ms. Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to emulate this gesture.
Receiving gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, director of the hospital, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be well used for the benefit of patients.
She appealed to other organizations for support for the hospital.
Google is creating the cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
The cooperation is to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw - a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish enterprises was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of establishing the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The partnership between the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the path that we set out less than a year ago, announcing the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains the same - to digitize the Polish economy and boost its growth.
“Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins their group today significantly strengthens our joint project,” says Zbigniew Jagiello, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
“The investment in the National Cloud Operator fits perfectly into the PFR strategy as an important element of the digitization of the country.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
“I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it,” adds Paweł Borys, President of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytics based on a leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner and BigQuery in the portfolio of services.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the National Cloud offer will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators,” says Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power necessary to process huge data sets.
VI National Seniors Parade
At noon, on August 24, 2019, at the Roundabout de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Seniors’ Parade “Matures Magnificent” and the Picnic of Generations, events organized by the Foundation Zaczyn, began.
As Przemysław Wiśniewski from the Foundation stated: “The parade is a phenomenon on a global scale.
This is the sixth time she has walked through the centre of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse the community of seniors is.
Through the Parade, we counteract harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity.”
The parade was conducted by a special double-decker coach serving as a musical mobile stage, on which the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika performed.
Participants in a joyful procession, at the second of the famous Warsaw and world hits, passed through Jerozolimskie Avenue, Krucza Street to Warsaw Insurgents Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Piłsudski Square and Królewska Street and Krakowskie Przedmieście Street to the Main Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous marchers, Varsovians and tourists gathered on the route.
The parade was attended by two organized groups in yellow and blue T-shirts.
The first representing the University of the Third Age and the Senior+ Club, and the second under the name SAGA, i.e. the Senior Active Group of Animators.
At the University Campus, the organizers have prepared, among others, gastronomic stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their everyday life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the stand of Stylish Senior Voice Seniors from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwał, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
The stand also offered a workshop for learning how to move around the stage and pose for photos.
The highlight was the Fashion Show of Stylish Seniors.
On the stand of the National Senior Voice there was the latest edition of the magazine and materials on the campaign "Stop manipulation - Do not buy at the presentation!".
Further stands offered cosmetic, movement, artistic and artistic workshops.
On several it was possible to do research and consult with specialists in health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of, among others: Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadli, Mariola Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow and Robert Janowski.
There was no shortage of musical and vocal attractions at the picnic.
On the stage there was a legend of the Polish song - Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dancing, which was led by DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide clues to cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers make breakthrough discovery that could revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treatment of oncological patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including one from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a groundbreaking discovery that could help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating deadly tumors within the face, threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study determined how to mask some cancer cells in both humans and marsupials, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which turns off a marker that would otherwise give the immune system a signal to attack the cancer.
This can pose the biggest challenge in treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and a type of skin cancer called Merkel cell cancer.
“The enormous importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance to immunotherapy, we may be able to reverse this process,” said AAP lead researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-enable markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
“This potentially has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,” Dawson said.
“This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat it much better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
“It’s remarkable that exactly the same process occurs (in human cancers and in Tasmanian devils),” Dawson said.
“So far, it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devil tumors.
But if human medications can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease.”
Scientists will be amazed by the fact that around a really small star orbits a very large planet
Scientists are surprised to discover a solar system 30 light-years from Earth that challenges our current understanding of how planets form, as a large Jupiter-like planet orbits a small star called a red dwarf.
An artist’s illustration of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting a red dwarf central star, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet slightly differ in size.
The size of the star, GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
“Yes, it’s an absolute surprise,” said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute for Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, who led the research published in the journal Science.
The finding is surprising because theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-mass stars tend to become host stars for smaller Earth-like planets or smaller Neptunes.
“In this case, we found a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter orbiting a very small star,” Morales said.
This planet, which like Jupiter consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star in a very elliptical orbit, and the full orbit lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
“That’s why they’re reddish,” Morales said.
“There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet may have been ejected from the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a Jupiter-like planet,” Morales said.
Planets form from the same interstellar disc of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to a leading model of planet formation called the accretion model, the object is initially formed from solid particles in the disk, and the planet's gravity at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere to form from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can be explained by a competing model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be a bit more massive than we expect and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a disturbance in the stability of the disk, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can build up until they collapse and form a planet.
Delicatessen worker accused of giving co-worker bean dip containing methamphetamine
The Marion County Sheriff's Office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for serving an associate bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, Albany-based Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, 38, was charged with supplying methamphetamine and causing another person to consume it, both crimes being second-degree crimes.
The indictment was based on the September 9 incident at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In an under oath statement obtained by OregonLive.com, a 27-year-old associate of the suspect told Marion County sheriff’s deputies that she had seen Medina-Hernandez make a bean dip during her lunch break and then offered it to her.
According to the statement, the victim, who, according to investigators, never took methamphetamine, said she “thought that one piece she ate tasted strange, but it didn’t raise any suspicions about it.”
When she returned to work, she felt that her stomach was upset and that she could not stand up.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was determined that the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez “told her she was going to add drugs to the food,” while another admitted the suspect had sent her a message, claiming that methamphetamine had hit the bean dip by accident.
The OregonLive website reports on a surveillance footage from the deli that allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez turning her back to the camera pulling something out of her bra, standing behind the microwave and leaning over.
Then he straightens up, wipes his nose, walks up to the table and puts a bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was also probably on the plate.
The Oregon Statesman-Journal reports that sheriff's office employees say there is currently no suspicion that customers will be given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Jail for $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, methamphetamine delivery, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of an illicit weapon.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": casting for the role of Jamie New at the West End
The next big star of the West End is waiting to be discovered, though she doesn’t know it yet.
'Everybody's Talking About Jamie' producers look for Jamie New and hold open auditions
Current star Layton Williams embarks on a musical tour of the UK, so the producers are looking for an “exceptionally talented, undiscovered young performer”.
The auditions in London will take place on October 10 at the Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 bars of the opening track "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CV and portrait photo.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and the next week the producers will be invited to the presentation again.
Producer Nica Burns said: “We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for another, third year at Apollo.”
We’ve found some fantastic young performers to join Layton Williams and Shane Richie on tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical we open up opportunities for unknown talents to join the current young professionals.
Williams, who took on the role of Jamie New in February and replaced John McCrea, encouraged "ALL the boys to send their tapes" on Twitter:
The musical's tour will begin in February and West End performances will be extended until August 29, 2020.
The musical tells the story of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the prom at the end of school in a dress.
He doesn’t know what the future holds, but he’s sure to become a star.
With the help of her mother and local community legend, Loco Chanelle begins to discover her identity, confront her prejudices, and pursue her career in the light of the flash.
The music in this performance inspired by the BBC documentary film "Jamie. Drag Queen at 16" was written by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and lyrics by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval wins an order in the natural gas industry worth SEK 110 million
Alfa Laval, a global leader in heating, centrifugal separation and liquid transport, has won an order to supply air cooler systems to a gas processing plant in the USA.

Marian Banaś.
What does KAS do about the head of NIK?
Renting a property for an amount below the market price is a reservation that arises in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Audit Office Marian Banas.
We asked about what the Treasury does in this matter in the Tax Administration Chamber in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
In a report for TVN’s “Superwizjer”, Bertold Kittel raised doubts about the financial statements of the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Marian Banas.
It has been under investigation by the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau for several months.
The audit is to be completed in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banaś was to rent a house with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received PLN 65,700 per year.
A report from the Superwizjer revealed that the tenement house rented by him housed a hotel for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on state television why he charged just over PLN 5,000 per month for renting real estate.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", citing experts on real estate valuation, estimated that for the tenement itself it should be PLN 15,000 per month.
“The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary contract and just the fact that the tenant was to buy this tenement house caused me to agree to a lower rent, that the remaining receivables will be settled when the tenement house is sold,” Banaś argued.
However, there were doubts as to whether such conduct constituted an infringement of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a spokesman for the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow, told TVN24 that “this matter is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance.”
“Please address all such questions to the Minister of Finance,” he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases “the National Tax Administration conducts activities”.
Paweł Jurek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, admitted that the National Tax Administration itself monitors many matters that may raise some reservations.
“The National Tax Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information and is based in a sense on that information, which is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether to conduct a specific case or not," the spokesman said.
“However, due to the fact that we are all bound by the tax secret in the entire finance department, that is why we never speak out, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a specific taxpayer, a specific person or a specific company,” he stressed, when asked about the case of Marian Banas.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that “the tax authorities do not provide this type of information to the public”.
“It is known that the entire treasury system deals with many similar cases throughout the country,” he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: surprising guests often flying a royal plane revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times throughout their lives.
This is usually facilitated by the King's plane - a private machine that transports the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.
It’s no surprise that having your own plane comes with privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, there are no limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests on board - including truly unprecedented ones.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, it’s not just the Queen and Prince Philip who often travel on a royal plane.
During a program called "Secrets of Royal Flight," the former Queen's Flight Navigator revealed that she and the royal family often flew furry guests.
Bob Shields said, “Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly.”
Unsurprisingly, the Queen may have wished her beloved pets to accompany her on her travels, as she is known for her deep attachment to Corgi dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these four-legged creatures, and there are rumors that she has owned over 30 corgis since her coronation.
She is said to have had five corgis in 2007: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dachshund crossbred dogs: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the Royal Plane must have had their hands full.
An employee of the royal house was seen walking the dogs and asking them to take care of their needs before taking them on board the plane, Shields said.
I'm glad to say there's never been an incident.
The programme also revealed the shocking amount of luggage the Queen takes on board during her travels as part of her official duties.
The narrator of the film stated: “In 1953, the Queen took 12 tons of luggage on her 70,000-kilometer journey.”
To illustrate it better, it is about the same as two huge elephants.
However, the Queen is not the only person with a weakness for fashion.
Apparently, the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own tastes regarding the transport of her wardrobe - it is said that each of her dresses is allocated a separate seat.
The new law comes into force.
Victims of accidents will receive pensions
On Friday, the regulation ensuring further payment of annuities to seriously injured persons comes into force, the Financial Ombudsman informs.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of injured persons in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee amount determined on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It applies to people who were injured before January 1, 2006.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were significantly lower than at present, so in some cases insurers have already stopped paying annuities.
“I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been working for many years to create a mechanism that will allow to provide a guarantee of financial support from the motor liability insurance or the farmer’s liability insurance despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum,” says Aleksander Dashewski, legal counsel at the Financial Ombudsman’s office.
According to the Financial Ombudsman Service, this was necessary, because it is often very tragic situations, involving people in very poor health who, due to an accident, cannot work, and at the same time incur significant costs of post-accident rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on civil liability policies.
Some of them were threatened in the coming years.
By January 1, 2006, the insurer's liability limits were much lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years most often affected people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low, and economic conditions caused an increase in prices.
“We also noticed that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount was EUR 350,000 for each victim of the accident.
Currently, it is 5.21 million euros per event, regardless of the number of victims.
So this is a huge difference from previous periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Aleksander Dashewski.
He explains that due to the fact that the guarantee amount is increased from time to time, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of sending a claim for payment of an annuity to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance company is not obliged to pay an annuity on the basis of a court ruling setting a different amount of the guarantee sum than set out in the civil liability insurance contract.
This is the case if the amount of the guarantee is increased in court on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows modification of the existing obligation relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We inform them about the new powers and, of course, provide them with the opportunity to provide further support in the event of any problems,” says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini learned that her boyfriend had shown his friends a sex tape that had been made in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect by education, explained to the court that her partner had ruined her life in this way and treated her like a “trophy” that you can boast about in front of friends.
“It violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything,” she argued.
The people of Cordoba have decided to do their own justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
Using a velvet band, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the chopper and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled up my pants and grabbed my cell phone to call an ambulance,” he said.
“I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by exposing the sex tape, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said to the jury.
She was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards has died at the age of 91.
On Friday, Alabama Republican Congressman Jack Edwards, who served 10 terms and was among the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South, died.
A family spokesman said Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after battling pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from the state of Alabama in the Deep South due to the party's gaining supporters there.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what kind of world he would like to leave to his great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like to return the courtesy.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-granddaughters will grow up in a country where there will be a return of courtesy to the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said in a statement.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of integrity.
She added that the flags on the Alabama State Capitol would be lowered to half mast in his honor.
“He was the epitome of a true civil servant and was the best statesman for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of its finest politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle 'inspiration' on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high praise for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the mold and makes our world a better place."
The Duchess and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth meeting earlier this week during which they met with leaders of the Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, ‘a caring leader who breaks the mold and makes our world a better place,’” the former first lady wrote in her enthusiastic post.
“Whether it’s meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation or helping girls around the world get the education they deserve, it’s an inspiration to many people,” she added, posting a picture of Meghan smiling posing with the foundation’s leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, guest-edited by the former actress of the TV series Suits.
In an honest conversation, the first lady talked about motherhood and how it changed her.
“Being a mother means leading to a mastery of the art of letting go,” Obama said in an interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that most of the time it’s my job to give children the space to explore the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their heart.
Obama, who knows from experience the pressure of being on the candlestick, shared her advice with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel - imposed by yourself and others - can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
“So my advice is to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent the first few months at the White House mostly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before I devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's what's needed, too.
Trump Hotel Retains Alcohol Sale Permit Despite Complaint About Owner's Attitude
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington, D.C. Alcohol Control Commission has rejected a motion seeking to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its license to sell alcohol due to the owner's disposition.
The agency ordered Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded, as most of them do not live in the district or own property in it.
The Washington Post reports that for the second time, plaintiffs are seeking to revoke a hotel’s liquor license, citing a district law that states that applicants for liquor licenses must be “good-natured.”
The original complaint, filed last summer, claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and cited allegations of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the permit was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
‘The Sun’: A crushing report finds Cleveland’s notorious police services the worst in the UK
Inspectors have called the Scandalous Police the worst in the UK.
In a devastating report, they assessed the work of the Cleveland police as inappropriate in all areas.
Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspector Phil Gormley says there has been a "significant deterioration" in the standards at the Cleveland Police Department.
There were new calls for the dissolution of the police services, headed by five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police did not make efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Her Majesty's Chief Inspector Phil Gormley said: "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year of investigation into "serious, albeit undisclosed, allegations of his conduct."
Deputy Commandant Adrian Roberts was suspended after his arrest on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before the commission on sexual misconduct for preparing female co-workers.
He's retired.
Tory Mayor Ben Houchen said: “This is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
The time has come for the Home Office to intervene now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said: "After making improvements, I take total responsibility for guiding the police force through the changes."
We have a visualization of the skatepark!
Will the young people finally come?
Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scooters and skateboards, while they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.
For years, young people have been asking for a place to ride roller skates, skateboards, scooters, bicycles.
The subject keeps coming back to our pages.
For 10 years we have been paying attention to this problem.
There has been a lot of talk lately about the lack of a skate park.
So we go back to that and ask what happens next.
We would like to remind you that a few days ago a woman who is disturbed by young people driving in the center spoke up.
“I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudski Square, so that you can be interested in the situation of the young people in Olawa,” Małgorzata writes to the editorial board.
“The residents of the block have repeatedly called the City Guard unsuccessfully.
As a proof of such everyday situations in the attachment, I am sending photos."
We asked the others for their opinion on the matter.
Most clearly state that young people simply do not have anywhere to ride in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves for years.
There was an avalanche of comments on Facebook.
As early as in July, we wrote that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built in Oławy Miasteczko.
The mayor announced that the city has applied for funding for the construction of the skatepark.
“The project with the young people is ready.
On 28 March, an application was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for co-financing the task entitled «Construction of the Skatepark in Oława» within the framework of the Sport Poland program”, we were told at the office.
Total value of the project: PLN 798 306.00.
The requested amount of funding: 263 440,00 PLN.
Again, we asked at what stage the matter was.
“We do not yet have information on the decision on the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism,” informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Department of European Funds at UM Oława.
“From the information obtained from the Ministry’s employees, it appears that ultimately the selection of all tasks under the Sporting Poland Programme should take place in October.”
We also asked for a visualization of the Olawa skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editors that next Saturday (28 September) they will collect signatures for a petition concerning the construction of a skatepark in Oława.
“The rebellious youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they will organize a collection,” writes Mikołaj.
Signatures of the petition will be collected from 12.00 in the area of the Lidl market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 of the final.
We know couples, hit from years ago
It was one of the toughest competitions in the league.
The biggest legend was the memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took on the Łódź team in the penultimate queue at the old stadium at Łazienkowska.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew’s second consecutive Polish championship gave him a point.
Until the 87th minute Legia led 2:0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake - Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the Łódź club fell into more and more trouble, until it ceased to count in the fight for the championship and fell from the top class of the competition.
The last time both teams met at this level was in the 2013/2014 season.
On the way to the title, Legia had two victories: 5:1 at home and 1:0 away.
Return to Elite
Currently, the boaters are struggling to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, because in the previous games, being one of the favorites, they failed to advance to the back of the extraclass.
Due to this failure, there was a personnel revolution in the club this summer.
The authorities changed, eventually Marcin Kaczmarek was chosen as the coach, and Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń, seasoned in league fights, are to help in taking the next step up the club hierarchy.
For now, Widzew is fourth in the II league table, but in the Polish Cup he beat the vice-leader of the league Wrocław 2:0.
The legion in the same size won at the departure of the Niepołomice Forest.
Ekstraklasa
The only pair composed of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 final are her ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place on 29-31 October.
This year, 1/8 of the final is scheduled to be played (December 3-5).
The final is to be held on May 2 at PGE Narodowy in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr ‘rebelled’ and impeachment inquiry must be on track
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are participating in an attempt to hide the facts of an attempt to hide the facts, and it may take time to investigate," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
“They will do the work they started by sticking to the facts and the time necessary to find them,” she added.
A White House report this week said Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Red Giuliani, on the matter, according to the protocol.
Trump has denied that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department had filed a complaint with the whistleblower regarding Trump’s conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal filing.
After receiving a complaint as a report from officials from the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department stated that Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign funding.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call as a witness.
She added, however, that she believed Barr had "rebelled".
This condition has been going on for a long time.
“He [Barra] is mentioned in all of this,” Pelosi added, referring to Trump’s mention of his attorney general during a July conversation with the Ukrainian leader.
It is interesting that he made decisions about how to handle the complaint.
Pelosi said she was “very worried” about whistleblowers who Trump attacked Thursday as spies, suggesting that spies had been treated differently in the past.
I think the president's words go beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our whistle-blowers play an important role in uncovering -- exposing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "The President's words about those who can provide information to a whistle-blower seriously undermine the integrity of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal investigation into the commission of an illegal act based on allegations of attempts to pressure a foreign state leader for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint published on Thursday in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his power to “incite Ukraine to interfere” in the upcoming 2020 election.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers had ordered officials to remove the recording of the conversation from the computer system where it is stored for the needs of Council of Ministers officials and put it in a system intended for sensitive information.

A possible speeding ban for Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke
Premier League star Christian Benteke, who has been caught speeding twice in the past two months, faces a driving ban.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old striker admitted driving a Bentley car at 80 miles per hour on the grounds with a 50-mile-per-hour restriction on the A3 road in Richmond, south-west London on January 20.
Then in March, speed cameras in Putney, south-west London, recorded a Belgian driving at 89 miles per hour, twice the 40-mile-per-hour speed limit.
Benteke from Kingston Hill, Surrey, doesn't have to appear at the Lavender Hill Peace Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offences at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure, under which lighter offences are tried at a sitting held by a single justice of the peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of the club Sekondi Hasaacas, has raised concerns about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the Ghana National Football Association (GFA).
He challenged the inclusion of Commission President Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts about whether the President of the Commission would show integrity, because the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Committee should be composed of neutral outsiders who have no affiliation with any of the members and who have not previously demonstrated an interest.
Davies, for example, hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer regarding the 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position on the Verification Committee because he has an interest in doing so," he claimed.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, stood before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President due to his association with the club, while suggesting that if Palmer stood before the Commission, he would be subject to prejudice and bias.
As expected, the members of the Commission were to start work from yesterday, after being sworn in at a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and finish it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and its members are Corporate Governance Consultant and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director, and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: No agreement on unity government
Israel’s two main parties, the Blue-White Alliance and the Likud Alliance, continued negotiations on the establishment of a unity government on Friday.
The meeting, which took place after the president entrusted the mission of forming the government to Benjamin Netanyahu, did not bring results.
The talks discussed the possibility of rotating the leadership of both parties in the government and Netanyahu remaining as prime minister, but - according to the Israeli daily Haaretz - there was no convergence of views.
Talks will resume on Sunday.
The Central Blue-White Alliance said in a statement that it had presented preliminary demands.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of being “stuck in its positions”, demanding that its leader and former prime minister, Netanyahu, remain in the head of the government, and in the cabinet, its former ultra-Orthodox politicians.
“From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue and White would not agree to these conditions,” the statement read.
Likud, acting solely in Netanyahu’s interest, wants to “lead Israel to the second round of elections.”
Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White Party, has refused to support a government he would lead as long as he is charged with involvement in three corruption scandals that could lead to him being formally indicted by prosecutors after a meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
“Likud and Blue-White won a sufficient majority in the September 17 elections to allow them to govern together as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate in ways neither side wanted,” the EFE news agency reported.
President Reuwen Rivlin has sought to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the establishment of a "rotational government", suggesting that the prime minister temporarily suspend his posts, which would allow Gantz to take up this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were sustained and formalized.
There is no shortage of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published on Friday by public television, want to unblock the political situation in the country through the establishment of a unity government under the rotating leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6% of Israelis are in favour of such a solution, while 32.1% of respondents oppose such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society: when asked who should be the first to lead the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents are in favour of Netanyahu and 40% of respondents are in favour of Gantz.
In another poll published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63 percent, while 60 percent oppose new elections, which would be the third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, he won the Gantz alliance, winning 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu, with his traditional and potential allies, can count on the support of 55 MPs, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties collected the 61 seats necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for fight before final match against Australians
Justin Tipuric says it's "time to test ourselves" when Wales faces a final match against Australia as part of the World Cup that could shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales' victory over the "kangaroos" would put the team in the position of a certain favourite to win Group D and secure a share in a possible quarter-final match against France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beat Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 games, Tipuric and his team will be immediately sent back to England for one eighth final.
“Let’s be clear, both teams want to try to get through this and be at the forefront of the group,” said Welsh striker Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they will try very hard to take this victory away from us, and we want to win it again.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big fight.
And now we're here, and it's really time to test ourselves.
Wales has only had one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - and that was 32 years ago in the third-place match when they beat the Kangaroos.
And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 attempts to beat three heavyweight teams from the Southern Hemisphere.
Wales halted a string of thirteen losing Test matches at the hands of Australia in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few survivors of that 9-6 win who will run out to the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
When asked if the team experienced a mental block before this victory, Tipuric added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so even that maybe... people expect there to be some sort of mental block, I don't know.
In the end, in the last match we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final result looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then Tipuric's fight with the beloved Australian third-line mill duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the stop and knockdown will be crucial.
Tipuric has played 67 games in the national team and met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
“They are players who are in the seventh position absolutely world-class,” he said.
When playing against world-class third-line players, it is always known that there will be a difficult match to play.
These two constantly compete with the best players in the world.
You know what game to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world to play defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better about rugby because he’s always in the right place at the right time.
It’s better to play against the best players in the world and face challenges than face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and struggling with these two, you definitely need to be in top form.
I wouldn’t say that Sunday will almost be the cup final, but for us it’s an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly make great efforts, we will fly like on wings and it will be difficult to beat us.

Premiere of the book.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of “gentlemen’s races”.
They took into their own ranks those whom they despised.
Can crime unite more than national identity?
In your hands we do not give another book on the subject of war or military.
We dedicate a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyze the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at the recruitment processes at various stages of the war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a branch consisting of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of collaboration in different European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, these questions are answered by the book “Waffen-SS” based on solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer truth of the picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of history through the presentation of dissertations by researchers from different countries. (...) While the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population - is compared to the comparative perspective.
'Total panic' as White House struggles to find grounds for impeachment
White House officials are scrambling to figure out how to fend off Thursday’s renewed impeachment pressure, and one interlocutor familiar with the situation describes the feeling of “total panic” felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This appears to increase “concern, uncertainty, and concern,” one of the White House associates describes the mood in the West Wing in this way, that the whistleblower’s allegations could seriously harm the president and those around him.
She said, “There’s not much certainty that there’s nothing there.”
White House officials were still unsure how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan to act in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effective avoidance used by the president in the past may not work.
Another person familiar with the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a “state of shock” accompanied by growing mistrust that with the protracted impeachment inquiry, the president is more likely to respond irresponsibly and become “difficult to contain.”
This fear is shared by another interlocutor who says that those around the president predict that he will exhibit more “sorry” behavior, and the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concerns that Trump may display increasingly unpredictable behavior and explode in unexpected ways, a concern in the context of the election year from both the presidency and the election perspective.
Faced with the greatest threat to the presidency to date, Trump has circled from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy he judged effective during Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russia.
He tried to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for help in investigating his political rivals, to divert attention and direct it to the actions of Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as being driven by party motives.
But while many people in the White House are battle-hardened after Mueller’s investigation, something has changed this time, advisers and consultants said.
The president, whose hallmark is strength, was shown to be defeated by Wednesday’s press conference,” said one person familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the president’s allies believe damage can be avoided, and some hold to the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of the controversial phone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which they say undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case when the president is the object of attacks, this fact is vividly raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House indicates that the results of the polls of support for the president are sky high, and impeachment will not affect too much to win new sympathizers.
"There is no positive in the need to focus on the president's impeachment in the next four months," especially if it hampers his legislative agenda and predominates in a new news headline cycle.
Another interlocutor claims that those who claimed impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worrying White House officials sought help from advisers, completing a response team to impeachment.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any command center-style initiative will be taken and what form it may take.
He said he believed a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a determined leader capable of launching a PR attack that would counter the whistle-blower’s virulent report and halt the Democrats’ momentum on the impeachment broadcast by the release of the report.
An interviewer familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin declared that they had no intention of disclosing a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was felt that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
It is now expected that the pressure will be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who mostly kept quiet and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who may be involved in the development of the response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trump’s dirty work and former head of the election staff.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will direct this action.
“Over the past five years, I’ve done everything I can to support the president and his program,” he said, “but I haven’t been involved in any conversations with the president or his team about joining the team to counter the false narrative of impeachment.”
Donald Trump's private attorney from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in the impeachment efforts.
"We're responding to things as they should," Sekulow replied when asked by NBC News for comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of an experienced impeachment lawyer, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton’s impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller’s investigation, passed away, and the current counsel, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
A spokesman familiar with the White House's strategy said officials generally did not plan to involve people or create a command center at any time, but acknowledged the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person capable of leading the political struggle.
Explorer of the Seas Royal Caribbean has been renovated for 89 million pounds.
Explorer of the Seas, part of the Royal Caribbean International family, will embark on a cruise this summer, presenting a completely new look.
After a renovation that took in an impressive $110 million ($89 million), the ship delights with a wide selection of culinary delights from around the world and a rich range of entertainment for the whole family.
This summer, Explorer will stop at the finest ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to experience the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land comes to an end, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable experience at sea.
With a satisfying offer for everyone, the Explorer has transformed after a $110 million renovation, or about 89 million pounds, into a passenger ship providing great entertainment for the whole family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family movie while enjoying the weather, as part of an outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that allow cabin occupants to enjoy ocean views without having to board.
Water lovers will be delighted by the newly designed deck by the pool combining the style of a Caribbean resort with the charms of a water park.

Created for toddlers Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and an exclusive place to spend free time for teenagers offers great games and a music zone prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this proves to be insufficient, the whole family can compete in the "studio B" on the ship in the game laser tag with the effect of shining in the dark, which in an impressive way can also serve as an ice skating rink.
During the cruise on the Mediterranean Sea, guests will also have the opportunity to experience exotic flavors from around the world, going to conquer the restaurants on board.
Modern Asian cuisine is offered on board at the Izumi restaurant, while the freshly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen serves delicious food inspired by a fresh take on traditional Italian cuisine.
Other dining options on board include the American Chops Grille, the Boleros Latin Bar, the Schooner Bar, and the Johnny Rockets Express Bar.
The cruise, with the option of a seven- or nine-day tour, departs from Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, she will join Allure of the Seas, which has also recently undergone an incredible overhaul.
After a 58-day metamorphosis of Allure, costing a whopping $165 million, the cruise operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation a $300 voucher to spend on board the ship.
The cruise operator said: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager-class vessel to undergo a transformation as part of the Royal Amplified fleet upgrade.”
The program, which requires an investment of more than $1 billion, spanning 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unique attractions and dining experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding ‘naked pictures of Trump’
Congressman Devin Nunes of California apparently can’t stand the naked truth that President Donald Trump is under investigation.
In his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused Democrats of wanting to receive nude photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the above allegation during a preliminary hearing following a complaint by a whistleblower that Trump had asked Ukraine for help in launching an investigation against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque portrayal" of the left and their "media ace" before stating that Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in negligee.
“Democrats on this committee have been negotiating with people who they believe were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump,” Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to impeach the president when they have a chance in a year.
When Nunes finished reprimanding her, HuffPost political reporter Jennifer Bendery set out to see if the Democrats were really trying to...discover it.
So far, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is a naked truth, which is a confirmation of the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com suspects Nunes' comments about the nudity referred to "certain more lascivious and unconfirmed information" that likely appears in Steele's controversial acts,
This is the notorious collection of allegations against Trump, gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape that allegedly shows him watching urinating prostitutes in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels could help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Tesla's Semi have dominated news services in recent years, one issue seems to be eluding renewable energy -- airplanes.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta’s Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Environment, who began working on this project in 2003.
His laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel derived from fatty waste such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than petroleum fuels, as well as use waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is designed to imitate hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
“What our technology has done in the first generation,” Bressler said, “is [to create] hydrocarbons that are identical molecules to diesel fuel.”
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuel, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which posed a serious threat in the case of high-altitude aircraft.
“The problem with jet fuel is a bit of a vicious circle,” Bressler said.
It’s actually worth less than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuel.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional hydrocarbon biofuel treatment and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
A splinter company formed by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to commercialize the product as airlines, as well as the Canadian and U.S. military, increase investment in the renewable option.
“They are able to imagine times when the situation can be reversed and a carbon tax will be imposed on them,” he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that is a contingency plan.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and has recently received a $4 million grant from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support the $25 million construction of a manufacturing facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel annually.
Bressler also notes that the projected carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transportation and fuel production are holding back further carbon reductions.
“As a technology specialist,” Bressler said.
I have the task of developing options that allow for informed decisions and multiple choices."

A resident of Zamość lost PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
Police were informed of the incident on Thursday by the son of a swindler.
“A woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he had an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he'll go to jail.
In order to help her grandson, the senior woman donated PLN 8,000 and 750 euros to a fake police officer who came to her house,” reports Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the Zamość police.
Police are looking for the perpetrator and once again call for caution:
“Any phone call asking for financial assistance needs to be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Remember that the police do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that raises our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling the emergency number 112.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s allies have warned that if Brexit is reversed, the UK could be threatened with DESIRE like in Los Angeles, and he is calling for calm.
One of the cabinet’s chief ministers said last night that the country faces a “violent social upheaval” if the initial result is challenged by the result of a second referendum.
The British prime minister's allies from his immediate entourage warned that the country was threatened with social unrest on the scale of the "yellow vest" protests in France due to social inequality and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson called for a "calm mood" during a heated argument over the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "surrender."
Despite his call for calm, the cabinet minister told The Times: “There have never been such protests in this country as the ‘gilets jaunes’ demonstrations or the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
People think it's impossible just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example - gilets jaunes - they use encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate pickets, and it only takes a few unfriendly populist leaders to push people to protest.
The Los Angeles riots erupted after a jury acquitted four white police officers of beating a black taxi driver, Rodney King, in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests - gilet jaunes - have been ravaging and devastating the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
Mr Johnson said that if the UK fails to leave the EU, there will be a “catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system”.
“If we have a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them are in favour of the UK remaining in the European Union, 10 million people will be unhappy,” he said.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their MP and who will not let go.
It doesn’t take much to see tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the cabinet’s chief ministers added that the country faces a “violent social upheaval” if the outcome of the first referendum is challenged by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide the fate of Brexit.
According to reports, the prime minister faces the risk of a cabinet revolt wanting to lower demands in connection with Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU instead.

Such a goal was set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The motto of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and it was around the creation of the future that the speakers invited to participate in the conference focused.
The first session was opened by the managing director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how the brand that is being built around itself can have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas took to the stage to change the perception of the audience about the phenomenon of rejection, arguing that it should be accepted if one wants to create the future, while Chris Badura took up the topic of empathy in the era of rapid development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help you manage your career and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right work-life balance.
The second part of the conference was opened by a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who talked, among other things, about how the profession of a lecturer in Poland has changed over the years from her perspective.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that - thanks to the development of technology - today everyone can engage in this profession.
However, he does not think that in the coming years the person in the position of a reader will be completely replaced by technology.
Just after that, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of living in times of information overload, emotional overload or overload in the matter of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Lętocha in his speech talked about what the next industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0" can lead to.
Playing teaches, teaching entertains
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting illusionist Daniel Jedynak to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonim and then - on the example of his own career - talked about how he tries to maintain the right balance between his career on the stage and his private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Szymon Hołownia, emphasizing the role of time in our lives.
The publicist noted that even two minutes can radically change the situation and you need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Hołownia shared his thoughts about the reality around us, recalling anecdotes that could cause a smile on the faces of viewers.
Then came Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and related them to how they are used today.
In the end, Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik’s cube, talked about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the great commitment on the part of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all those who were personally unable to attend the event, and recordings of the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
“Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers,” the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights wrote in a report published on Thursday.
The report “Rule of law instead of the rule of law” documents, among other things, changes in the judiciary and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “Rule of law instead of rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the greatest regression in the field of human rights protection in Poland after 1989 was recorded.
Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the tri-division of powers.
By adapting the law to political ends, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," the HFHR experts write.
What about the HFHR report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women’s rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the three-year-long dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
“In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the law to pursue particular party interests.
This has translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as the weakening of the entire system of human rights protection in Poland,” emphasized Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As the report points out, the last four years have been a “period of systemic changes both in the state” and “in the protection of human rights”.
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legal acts for the protection of human rights.
“Changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without public consultation and despite the objections of the legal community, the Ombudsman or international organizations,” said Małgorzata Szuleka, a co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “weakening independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), disregarding binding court judgments and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening the guarantees of human rights protection.”
The authorities did not react.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights said it was particularly concerned about “those situations in which the state authorities did not react or directly disregarded the emerging cases of aggression.”
Foundation experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state’s activity in the field of limiting the rule of law is an ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from subjects of international law.
“Failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland’s position as a leader of democratic changes in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to liability for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights,” the report reads.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life sentence for honor killing
Women's rights experts say that seeking justice is often difficult due to protracted proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail, and the blurring of cases in the public consciousness.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzana Bari, a women’s rights advocate and founder of Pakistan’s first gender studies department at the university, and adds that even the widely publicized Baloch murder case has been settled for more than three years.
Despite the fact that, according to groups fighting for women’s rights, reliable data is difficult to determine, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission in 2018 found at least 300 so-called honor killings.
Many activists say the actual number is much higher, and a network promoting awareness of honor-based crimes estimates that there are about one-fifth of the 5,000 honor killings per year in Pakistan around the world.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are decreasing, because many emigrants settle outside Poland permanently, reports Friday’s Rzeczpospolita.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that average earnings of Poles working in other European countries in 2018 amounted to over PLN 8,600, which means that they increased by almost PLN 1,000, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “estimates that the total income of Polish economic emigrants in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one-seventh more than in the previous year”, we read.
Paweł Kaczmarczyk, Director of the Migration Research Centre at the University of Warsaw, says that Poles are doing better and better in the international labour market, where they use various available options.
“There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of better conditions, as well as employees of multinational corporations,” the newspaper reports.
During the year, some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Germany.
“It was in Germany in 2018 that the total earnings of Polish emigrants increased the most, by 11% (to nearly PLN 27 billion).
However, Poles in the UK earned the most - almost PLN 35 billion", we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic emigrants is not decreasing.
Saxes in the West and North of Europe (led by Norway) are often a chance for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
“Even with minimum rates in a given country, which in Germany, for example, are between 9.5 and 11.7 euros per hour,” reports the daily.
Rzeczpospolita reports that Poles stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles take root abroad, which can also be seen after decreasing remittances to the country.
Last year’s were the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chroscicki reminds, with the extension of the period of stay abroad, the group of people transferring money to the country decreases and their amount decreases.
“Emigrants bring their loved ones to their homes,” says Rzeczpospolita on Friday.
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
India’s monsoon season has already been extended by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from building collapses and many crops to rot.
In northern India, monsoon usually subsides at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the norm by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon in decades.
Rainfall is still unprecedented in many areas of the country, with heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday in the western Indian city of Pune, resulting in the deaths of a dozen people and the ravages of buildings collapsing.
There was a flood of houses, people walking through the streets in water to their knees, which normally happens only during the apogee of the monsoon.
Heavy rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
As a result of prolonged rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
The monsoon also started with a delay.
Water was scarce in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a probable drought.
For too long, monsoon is not welcomed by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
“Because of him, my vegetables - and I now have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes - will rot,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the effect of a delayed and also late ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, which is an indispensable ingredient of Indian dishes.
Onions, which usually had to be paid 20 rupees (0.23 British pounds), currently cost 80 rupees (about 1 British pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
The next big festival is Dasara on 8 October, during which Hindus build huge puppets like from a comic book, depicting Ravana, a character with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic “Ramajana”.
Ravana smoking symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's images are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana will be the last to laugh.

Doodle Celebrates Google's 21st Birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google.
In the search engine, we look for answers to all the questions that bother us.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" are some of the favorite categories searched by Poles.
According to the data of the giant, last year we were eager to ask, among others, “Where is the storm?”, “How to make asparagus?” and “How many fingers does a horse have?”, “How to get rid of fruit flies?”, “How to eat kaki?”.
Today, the search engine celebrates its twenty-first birthday.
Its users - and in Poland as many as 96% of people use "Uncle Google" - are welcomed today by a special Google Doodle.
This time it is not animated.
Google is recalling its birthday by showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and a digital date was printed in the lower-right corner - as in a photo from the 1990s.
Cataloguing information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose - it was supposed to catalog all possible information and share it via the Internet.
Its name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning the number ten raised to the hundredth power.
The name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as many pages as possible from the world's Internet resources.
Google Search was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than methods of simply sorting results based on the frequency of occurrence of a given phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to a given result.
Page and Brin founded Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon after launched the now-famous website google.com.
What next, Google?
In December 1998, the PC Magazine reported that Google’s search results were highly relevant.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquering more markets and increasing the value of the company.
As early as June 2000, Google’s URL index has over a billion entries, making Page and Brin’s work the world’s largest search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
Is there still room for development?
“Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information resources so that they are widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this area, we still have a very long way to go to achieve this goal,” Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland told Newsweek.
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to high-concentration plant protection products may translate into a high risk of heart disease later in life.
This was the case for a group of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii who were studied for more than 30 years.
The researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
“This study highlights the need to use personal protective equipment for the duration of exposure to pesticides at work, and the importance of accounting for contact with such agents at work in medical records, as well as controlling for standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease,” said study co-author Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
The results were based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Cardiology Program.
The study results may not apply to women and other populations, as they only applied to men of Japanese descent.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so the effects of their effects on health can be felt many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said: “After 34 years of observing men, the association between pesticide exposure and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.”
This was probably because aging-related factors were becoming more important, masking possible cause-and-effect relationships between pesticide exposure and cardiovascular disease incidence in later years of life.
The researchers found no significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko adds his three cents
Washington’s politics has had a turbulent week with the initiation of an impeachment procedure against U.S. President Donald Trump
Getting involved in a political scandal is a situation for political debutant Volodymyr Zelensky, which he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelensky-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching consequences for the former?
Almost at the beginning of the phone call, Trump told Zelensky that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes released by the White House are not complete, they describe in detail Trump’s attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader, along with other leaders of European countries, are engaging in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
Zelensky responded that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelensky added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to speak through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s former president, said on Twitter that the EU’s support “was unprecedented.”
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU’s support during the “Russian aggression”, which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska, who said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now?”
Trump then mentioned military aid and asked Zelensky to investigate not one, but two cases: one involving Joe Biden’s son Hunter, and the other relating to a DNC server hack, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democrats’ email boxes during the 2016 election.
It is not known whether this will damage European relations or break relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who helped us,” Zelensky said after the phone call was published in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelensky is scheduled to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming Normandy Four summit in October.
Former provincial inspector legally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the charges against him.
After 6 years Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally acquitted of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Provincial Inspectorate of Quality of Agricultural and Food Products in Rzeszów, of the charge of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin prosecutor’s office accused him of revealing to the then Marshal of the Voivodeship the date of the inspection in the plant producing food oil.
A final acquittal was recently handed down in this case.
The appeal was heard on September 12.
“The court upheld the challenged acquittal,” confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, a spokesman for the District Court in Przemyśl.
This is the verdict of February 14th, issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on his Facebook page: “Six years have passed since the Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin presented me with an allegation of an alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship at that time was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of events that the media drew up in 2013 by the Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin was untrue and caused irreparable damage to both the food manufacturer’s entrepreneur and the loss of my image among my employers, employees and the local community.
The indictment that was drawn up against me in the opinion of the Court contained a number of errors, untrue facts, unreliable determinations of legal grounds, not confirmed in the reality of events.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of funds.
I stayed with my wife for a long time.”
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the provincial inspector of agri-food quality in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from his post after the prosecutor’s office in Lublin presented him with charges in 2013.
According to investigators, in a telephone conversation he was to reveal to the then marshal of the province (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the date of control in a food oil production plant belonging to the wife of the then deputy marshal of Podkarpackie.
This warning, according to prosecutors from Lublin, was to make the owner of the company aware of the inspection and to correct the labels on the oils, which were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski was charged with exceeding his powers, for which he was threatened with up to 3 years of imprisonment.
“I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now confirmed by a final verdict acquitting me of the charges against me,” Jerzy Wiśniewski comments.
The White House tried to hide the record of the conversation with Zelensky
In a report released on Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, sought foreign interference in the US election, and the White House sought to hide the record of the conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the whistleblower, who is probably an intelligence official, wrote: “As part of my official duties, I have been informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president has been using his office to demand foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election.”
“Trump used part of the conversation [with Zelensky] to pursue his own interests.
Specifically, he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president to be re-elected in 2020,” the report said.
The Ukrainian leader was “understood” that his contacts with Trump depended on whether he would “make the will to play” on matters that President Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer was supposed to have informed him about.
The author admits that he did not witness the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its content by "many White House officials who had direct information about it", and their relations overlapped.
“In the days following this conversation, I learned from a number of U.S. officials that high-ranking White House officials intervened to “seal” all archival records pertaining to this conversation, and especially the literal record that was made, as is usually done, in the White House crisis room,” the statement continued.
“High-ranking White House officials told me that the White House lawyers “ordered” them to remove the electronic record from the IT system where such records are stored.
The record has been moved to a separate electronic system, which is typically used to store and manipulate sensitive information," the report's author wrote.
"In my opinion, these steps demonstrate that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the whistleblower said.
The document is likely to speed up the investigation into a possible impeachment of the president, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The recording of the conversation with Zelensky was made available by the White House on Wednesday, after pressure from Congress, not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the accounts of the people who witnessed it.
The report, in an edited version, was released a day later by the House Intelligence Committee.
Also on Thursday, Acting Director of U.S. Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee and gave explanations on how he handled the intelligence worker's report.
Maguire said the whistle-blower made the right choice and did as the law dictates.
He also stressed that in his opinion the issue of talking with Zelensky is an event “without precedent”.
Democrats on the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the whistleblower's report from being made available to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he had no authority to disclose its contents, the confidential nature of which guarantees the so-called executive privilege.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that in connection with the suspicion that the president was pressuring the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump’s impeachment.
A day later, she said Trump’s record of talks with Zelensky confirmed that the US president had broken election and security standards.
Voters in the United States are not allowed to use the help of foreign countries.
On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said there was “nothing inappropriate” in the conversation, and the report said there was “nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts and press clippings glued together.”
“The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative propagated by the mainstream media,” she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was given in recognition that Ghana had the highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent in the Temporary Effective Implementation (EI) rate.
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Agency’s Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program.
The security award was a recognition of the country’s high commitment to implementing ICAO-recommended security standards and protocols at airports and in Ghana’s airspace.
The award program was developed to provide support to the ICAO’s No Country Left Behind initiative.
In addition, ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards have been granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ghana Ambassador to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo, and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed the need for Member States to maintain safety in the airspace.
“It is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in an age of innovation, aviation security and sustainability must remain our top priorities.”
For his part, Mr. Adda noted that the awards were a tremendous achievement for the state's efforts, as they compliment the industry's hard work and perseverance.
He also added that the aviation industry has great potential for the development of the country’s economy, saying “the aviation industry has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but it all comes from the security and protection we have managed to achieve."
He gassed and ran and stole a bike.
The 50-year-old from the Zamość municipality drove his Audi to the distributor, refueled and left without paying.
In this way, he robbed gas stations several times.
A month ago, a man also stole a bicycle from one of the Zamość authorities.
The owners of petrol stations valued the losses at almost PLN 1,000.
The owner of the stolen bike - for 2 thousand PLN.
Last Tuesday, one of the Zamość districts noticed an Audi on Wyszyńskiego Street, whose owner was suspected of theft.
There was a 50-year-old man behind the wheel.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he was charged with stealing fuel from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
They also found a stolen bike.
The car will soon return to its owner.
For theft, the thief faces a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as FEMA chief: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when testifying at a meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on National Security on FEMA's 2020 budget proposal at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, FEMA’s deputy administrator, serves as the head of an agency that oversees the government’s response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has operated without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long fired the position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which controls FEMA, found that Long had improperly used government vehicles to drive between Washington and his North Carolina home.
Another candidate for the position, Jeffrey Byard, was pulled earlier this month when a thorough background check revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor was expected to be nominated for the position.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became deputy administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considers finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized in the 1500 metres distance, winning the European Championship gold medal in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the European runner-up for the 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this is not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation right after the games in 2016, but the pain returned and this season has become much worse.
The pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes the system of my body, other unnatural loads occur and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example in the hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the World Cup, and for two weeks the pain has been so severe that I have difficulty putting on the spikes,” the runner told NRK TV.
Father and coach Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, they concluded that the only solution for him not to end his career and participate in next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although drastic solution and the decision has already been made.
“If a part of the body hurts, you should get rid of it, and in fact Henrik doesn’t need that finger so much, and in this situation you should forget about the cosmetic aspect,” he explained.
Police close illegal marijuana e-cigarette factory in San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police on Thursday shut down an illegal marijuana e-cigarette factory in the San Gabriel Valley.
A raid was carried out on an office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue around 4:37 p.m., during which police searched for illegal marijuana-containing e-cigarettes and found large jars containing butane hash oil, a cannabis concentrate.
According to Lt. Christopher Cano of El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to replenish vaping cartridges.
“This process is very dangerous,” Cano says.
Cano, who once worked on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
“A simple electrostatic spark from our clothes can ignite these fumes, causing not only a fire, but due to concentration, even an explosion,” he says.
“If we have many jars and the like in the room, one explosion will be followed by another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could wipe out the entire complex.
A task force was called to the office building to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, which detected illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products have not hit the streets, given recent articles on the dangers of vaping.
“People don’t really know what products they’re buying,” Cano says.
“They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can pose a threat to our community and children, which is why we always caution them against reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has made a decision on a cure for thrush
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate announced that the drug for oral infections has been withdrawn from the market.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat thrush and yeast infections of the oral mucosa, infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used to help treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to non-compliance with the requirements of the product quality specification and a decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenowy Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, each month, GIF issues several decisions to withdraw individual series of products from the market.
A series of drug suspended in Poland can, after presenting evidence of its safety, be re-launched on the market.
This is not possible if the medicine is withdrawn.
19 PLN banknote - where to buy a collector's banknote of this denomination?
It bears the denomination of 19 zlotys and features the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collector’s banknote will be put into circulation, the National Bank of Poland announced.
This is another banknote from the “Independence” series.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Polish Security Printing Works.
As stated in the NBP statement, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the 100th anniversary of the PWPW.
Also, the nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of the creation of the Plant" - reads the NBP statement.
The watermark depicts the image of an eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after regaining independence.
A novelty is the holographic strip located on the window in the ground.
The front side presents a portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription “independent” a stylized image of the Order of the White Eagle is presented.
This inscription, copied from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is the logotype of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Poland’s regaining independence.
In the laurel branch, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, is a special form of angular effect.
On the reverse side of the banknote there is an image of the Wytwórnia building against the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
Next to the PWPW logo there is a SPARK Live protection and an iridescent strip, also visible in UV light in the form of the repeated number "19" and the abbreviation "NBP" - describes the NBP.
The banknote is due to go into circulation on October 2nd with a circulation of up to 55,000 pieces.
One bill will cost $80.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NBP, including those from special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value far exceeds that which can be achieved in the collector’s market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or over two million, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto a barge.
From there, he crossed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
PiS President Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming elections.
“Please do the same,” he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for the photo of the PiS banner candidate.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" boasted on social media that it will gain Kaczyński's voice in the parliamentary elections.
“Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska,” reads her Facebook profile.
The head of the party pointed out that he is a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to help.
“I will cast my vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska and I ask for the same,” she appeals.
Gosiewska is a candidate for the Sejm from District 19 (Warsaw) and from the third place on the list.
The “one” is Kaczyński himself, and Mariusz Kamiński takes the second place.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
We have meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
“We’re here to break stereotypes.
It is said that the inhabitants of Podkarpacie do not read books.
We will show that it is different," Marta Półtorak said during a press conference.
Who is going to be supporting Rzeszów this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia, hailed as the first cook of the Republic of Poland, will appear at the fair, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Świek.
This autumn, a great cultural event will take place in Millennium Hall - on November 22 and 23, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair, which is one of the most important reading events in the region, will come to the shopping center.
The most interesting publishing houses and bookstores from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, including Agora, Znak, SQN, PWN and Czarne.
At their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book novelties, which the participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, authors who write about important issues and are not afraid to take up difficult topics, and moreover, they are winners of prestigious awards and... they cook great.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, participation in the fair was confirmed by, among others, Łukasz Orbitowski - the winner of a political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-selling "Loneliness in the network", and the queen of Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year’s fair will be Sister Anastasia, the author of several books (including cookbooks), which have sold over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of Elizabeth I's missing dress at Hampton Court Palace
The dress, interspersed with silver thread, made of the finest silk camomile, was exquisitely decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The faded fabric hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny village parish church she was looking at could only be a missing piece of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn accidentally stumbled upon a lavish altar cloth in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth’s missing gown is set to hit an exhibition at Hampton Court Palace next month, close to the same rooms where the Tudor queen could have worn it over 450 years ago.
A measure of the significance of this discovery is that of the entire collection of royal dresses, only one more element of the 16th-century dress has survived.
While there is no conclusive evidence that Elizabeth ever wore the dress, three years of research have strengthened experts’ belief that it must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silverheads", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, indicates that the dress belonged to the most exquisite of people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, may have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
“Furthermore, in the 1690s, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt threatened by other women at court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fancy fabrics,” Lynn said.
“As this is a very important statement, I have asked a lot of people in the community to look at the dress.
I was really happy that seeing the dress, they also admired it and were practically convinced that we had an element of royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long, renewed life of a dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth at the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the village from which Blanche Parry, the closest lady to Elizabeth, who served the Queen throughout her long life and with whom the said fabric was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth must have given it to the Parry family or the parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four hundred of which were spent on the most delicate hand-sewing using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar cloth will go to the exhibition next to the portrait “Rainbow Portrait”, one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a cloth.
“When working with historic fabrics, the craftsmanship of the people who made them is really beginning to be respected,” says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse at Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough place to house some of the palace’s priceless tapestries.
“Looking at the embroidery on the front and back, I started to feel a huge respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elitist.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth opens on October 12 at Hampton Court Palace.
Fitch confirmed Poland’s rating with a stable outlook
On Friday, Fitch confirmed Poland’s long-term rating in foreign currency at the “A-” level.
The rating outlook remained stable.
“Fitch points to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a well-diversified economy that is supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector,” the statement said.
Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the peak of the business cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
The agency forecasts that the general government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below the 3 percent limit, respectively 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent.
According to the agency, the ratio of government debt to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, and in the following years it will be smaller (on average 48.3 percent in the period 2020-2021).
Rating Poland
S&P and Moody’s will conclude the autumn round of Poland’s rating reviews on 11 October.
According to Fitch, Poland’s rating remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the "A-" level with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest rating agencies, Poland’s creditworthiness is rated the highest by Moody’s at the “A2” level.
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is “A-”, one level lower than Moody’s.
The outlook for all assessments is stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are set up to help investors assess the risks of their investment activities.
The rating is given to companies, banks and states.
In the case of the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
A credit rating is nothing more than a credit rating.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information also suggests who is best not to grant any loans at all, because there is a big risk that the money will not be able to be recovered.
A lower rating carries a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Any assessment must be reasoned and reasoned.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At present, more than 90 percent of the global rating market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s.
Each of them has its own evaluation system.
"Confederate Five": First 1000 plus
The "Confederation Five", or the main assumptions of the electoral program, were presented on Friday in Koszalin by candidates for the Sejm from District 40 applying for a mandate from the KW list of the Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koszalin Sejm list, Krzysztof Chmielewski, presented the slogans of the “Confederation’s fives”.
“Firstly, the 1000 plus program for Poland, secondly, quick and fair courts, thirdly, cultural and educational vouchers, fourthly, national security, fifthly, it is a healthy life,” said Chmielewski.
He noted that “Poles must finally start earning decently”, which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, “the problem with the tax-free amount will resolve itself”.
“Poles must be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary Social Security for all,” said the leader of the list about the assumptions of the “1000 plus program for Poland”.
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadencka, starting from the second place on the list, referring to the slogan “healthy life”, said that “food is getting worse” and to change this, we should “support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture”, work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy is also in favour of stopping the “stigmatization of hemp.”
Zadencka declared her support for the Confederation for “the development of construction using natural raw materials”.
She also spoke out on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccinations.”
“The right to informed consent cannot be violated,” she added.
Subsequent candidates for the Sejm from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederation is in favour of “conducting a deep reform of the judiciary”, which would include examining the case by a judge “day after day”.
They also advocated that the educational subsidy should go to schools without the mediation of local governments, that is, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of civil servants.
The Confederation is also behind “a strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”.
Candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of the army.
They also need easier access to weapons.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for “permanent access to energy”.
"We can gasify coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider a return to the idea of a nuclear power plant," said the fifth on the electoral list, Piotr Karpiński.
Mexican drug cartel boss is responsible for one-third of U.S. drugs
Just after sunrise on the West Side of Chicago, CBS News reported on the morning's drug chase.
Brian McKnight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has given a full picture of what is going on.
Last year, nearly 800 people in Chicago died from drug overdoses.
McKnight stated "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
“It’s a top priority for the DEA and directly for federal enforcement agencies in the United States,” said Matthew Donahue, the DEA’s chief agent in Mexico.
The prize for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one-third of the drugs reaching the U.S. by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled “tons” of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he set up the brutal cartel.
It has a huge number of weapons, RPG, 50 caliber weapons.
Basically, it has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho defends his empire with impunity, using such measures as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hangings this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to statistics of the Mexican government, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that you can't deal with them without protective equipment.
In a cocaine lab, it's called a smuggler's brand.
For more than a third of them, the traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He's the one who's responsible for sending the poison that kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So, when someone’s child dies, Donahue says there’s a “high chance” that the drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of an overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmails French president and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, according to French prosecutors.
The defendant assures that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He demanded from the head of state, among others, 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man, who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police force in France, claims to have received “explosive” documents from a person employed at the Elysée Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but revealing them in their entirety may even threaten the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300,000 euros - he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from a previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the accused refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He said he would pass it on to the media, but it is not yet known if the documents really exist.
They were not found at the time of the search in the 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric examinations, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders in him.
PS4 will be old-school - Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony is shedding more light on the upcoming PS4 exclusive The Last of Us: Part Two.
As part of the recent State of Play presentation, Sony announced that the sequel The Last of Us will be released in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed in the days following the release of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school vibes in many ways.
It was decided to do something that we haven’t seen very often since PS1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several discs.
Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann confirmed this in a sensational interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most comprehensive games in history.
“The plot is ambitious and intricate in aspects where the one wasn’t,” he said.
It had to be so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren’t going to create the most extensive game, it just happened.
“We’re excited about how many possibilities there are in this story. There will be times when you think you’re coming to an end, but you realize that this is just the beginning and that a whole new chapter is beginning,” Druckmann continues.
It’s such an ambitious game that it didn’t fit on one BluRay and it’s on two discs.
It was revealed elsewhere that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggs with adult content (information provided by Gamestpot).
We will not spoil the surprise, but the Easter eggs appearing in the game refer to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two launches on February 21, 2020 exclusively on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the release of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered from October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the aforementioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a pre-order for the sequel, Sony has announced that there will be multiple versions of the game, including an exclusive edition featuring a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this iconic character.
Run, tug and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskidzie and he wants to win.
Stomil’s players have been undefeated for three rounds.
The charges of Piotr Zajączkowski scored seven points during this time, because they won against Stała Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match there was a goalless draw in Suwałki.
Now the Olsztyn team on Saturday at 6 p.m. will take Podbeskidzie, which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to the Ekstraklasa.
Stomil's closest rivals take fourth place in the table and have a point advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskidzie has played six times this season and has scored two victories, draws and defeats. Stomil feels very good at his facility - at the stadium at al. Piłsudskiego 69a Piotr Zajączkowski's team won three times and lost once.
Alsztynians accumulated 17 points in ten rounds and are at the top of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the competition, nothing predicted this.
“Every change takes time to produce results,” explains Piotr Skiba.
“In the end, something happened to us, we believed in ourselves, and we can work under normal conditions.
We just focused on the ball game.
There are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil’s players eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed extra time and a series of penalty kicks.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zajączkowski gave these key players a rest before Saturday's skirmish with Podbeskidzie.
In Chorzów, however, Jakub Mosakowski returned after an injury, who finally scored his long-awaited goal.
“It’s always nice to score, and I hit a point where we can still play in the cups (Mosakowski equaled 3:3 in the 119th minute - ed.).
My dad used to chew on me and laugh that I couldn’t score, and I always told him I’d shoot when he didn’t expect to.”
Now Mosakowski hopes to return to the basic line-up, especially that because of the yellow cards he can not play Oleh Tarasenko.
“That’s why I play hard in training so I can play in the first team,” says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzów I did everything to present myself as best as possible.
However, whether I play or sit on the bench, I will support the team just as strongly.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the match against Podbeskidzie.
We will certainly have a tough meeting where the victory will have to be run out, torn down and fought.”
Rafał Remisz can still play in the middle of the Olsztyn defence, who recently also suffered an injury, so we will know whether he will perform on Saturday, especially since coach Zajączkowski traditionally tries to keep personnel matters secret until the end.
Man raped and murdered his niece
“You will never see the light of day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alexa Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and despicable that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple pointed out the location of the body.
“How could anyone do this to their niece?” asked Dejay Smith, the girl’s uncle.
“You’re the worst person humanity has to offer,” Whipple told Alexa.
“I would give anything to meet her again, to hug her,” said the mother of the murdered girl.
“Our lives will never be the same again,” the devastated woman added.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the hearing.
Last month, he admitted to abducting, sexually abusing and murdering a girl.
The man’s lawyer said his client had grown up in an “imperfect family.”
He was to be molested as a child.
He added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was willing to face punishment.
The man was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of applying for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would donate nearly $100 million in additional funds to drought-affected communities.
The scheme to provide money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for allocating farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package includes nearly $34 million for a support initiative for drought-affected communities, allowing eligible farms to receive up to $3,000 in emergencies.
Each of the 13 local government areas under the Drought Relief Program will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and disaster relief assistance.
The new support package is in addition to the more than $7 billion the government has allocated to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
In China, the number of divorces has doubled in the last decade.
This was generally due to third parties.
More and more men are having extramarital relationships, which has resulted in the development of a special industry in this country - professional slayers of lovers, who are tasked with saving the marriages of betrayed wives.
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-ear!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Piekary Śląskie
A strange general rehearsal was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląskie.
Ladies and gentlemen, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let’s shout loudly: “Ma-te-ear!”, the leader urged.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic leader did not bring the expected result.
Election campaign in progress.
Politicians are driving around the country, persuading voters.
The intensive campaign is also led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as the leader of the Silesian PiS list is a frequent guest in the region.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the right setting.
That was, or should have been, the case in the United States.
A special guest must be greeted.
Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, the present leader decided to conduct a general rehearsal.
Like a dry sailor, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
“This will not be a greeting for me, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder dear ones!” he encouraged enthusiastically.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not let themselves be fully taken up by the hot suggestions of the host and reluctantly answered "Ma-te-ear", but the recording of the enthusiastic leader makes a furore in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of murdering ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
Authorities said he entered the Stay home on July 9, 2014, demanding the whereabouts of his wife, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one member of the family, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
Authorities said she was badly injured, but managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the grounds of insanity.
The jury will meet again on Monday to give its verdict.
Quantum Internet is getting closer to reality - ScienceDaily
U.S. military research takes the quantum internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection, and time-keeping accuracy unavailable with the traditional approach to networking.
The Center for Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Advancement of Combat Opportunities of the U.S. Army looked at researchers from the University of Innsbruck, who managed to achieve a record-breaking transfer of entangled state between matter and light - over a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quanta such as qubits.
When two qubits are entangled and one of them is measured, it will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the other qubit is physically distant.
“These [50 kilometers] are two orders of magnitude further than previously possible, and this is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks,” said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and principal investigator in the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant knots of physical qubit networks that are entangled with each other despite the large physical distance.
The researchers concluded that this scattering of the entangled state is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
“This demonstration is a big step forward to achieve a diffuse entangled state on a large scale,” said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-director of the military program supporting the research.
The quality of the entangled state at the other end of the fiber is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team began the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
With the help of laser beams, the researchers entered the quantum state into the ion, simultaneously arousing it to emit a photon in which quantum information was stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were entangled.
The challenge is to send the photon with a fiber optic cable.
“The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the fiber,” said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of the photon has been converted to the optimal value from the point of view of long-distance transmission - the current standard telecommunication wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometer fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and particles of light were still entangled even after converting the wavelength and traveling this distance.
“The decision to choose calcium means that this result paves the way for the creation of a tangled network of atomic clocks over long physical distances, as calcium can be co-imprisoned with high-quality ‘clock’ qubits.
The Army is very much interested in entangled large-scale clock networks due to their applications for precise positioning, precise navigation, and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
