Welsh National Assembly MPs fear they will 'look like fools'
Some members of the National Assembly were alarmed by the proposal to change their title to “MWP” (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned that this could bring ridicule.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that “the abbreviation rhymes with twp and pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" means poop.
A Welsh MP said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative MP said his party was taking a “liberal” approach to the name change, but noted that the MWP is not far from the word “muppet.”
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission is currently working on the bill, which will bring about changes in the names, stating: "The final decision on the possible designation of the Assembly members will of course be the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on the proposals with the public and the results showed broad support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the designation of the Assembly Members, the Commission preferred the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament" (WMP), but the MWP option received the greatest support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are obviously trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be reaching an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Members of Parliament and a draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on their designation when they debate the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to “North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was announced in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor expresses a claim to Greek territory, and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Orge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price a country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bells Suspended Due to Harlem Church Problems
“The old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams says.
“Today there are neither one nor the other.”
In his opinion, the decline of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently,” he says.
“The bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.”
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as leaders think, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
He said churches could be printed by rental homes, with residential neighborhoods filled with people who won’t support the remaining temples in the area.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says. “The day will come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the capital of the black population. Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Congregation of Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The building was claimed by a black congregation that performed religious services nearby.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson. He was a central figure in a boycott of retailers on 125th Street (Harlem's most prominent shopping street) who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but Johnson's parishioners had plans to rebuild the church to produce the bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The specialist, who played the bell in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This specialist is Tiffany Ngová from the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bellplay in the world played by a black musician - Dionisio A. Lind. He began playing a larger bellplay at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one at St. Martin's Church replaced him.
Over the past few months, a complex story of architects and contractors has taken place in St. Martin’s Church, some led by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish administration, which is made up of secular leaders and runs the parish, wrote in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “lead the costs to” the parish administration, despite the parish administration not being involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency regarding the conduct of the diocese.
13-year-old boy who hunted lobster in California injured by shark
Authorities said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday as he hunted a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then sailed with the group to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited that he had caught the lobster, but then “he found the boy screaming: ‘Something bit me!
Something bit me!”
He had a completely torn clavicle," Hammel said, noting first when he got to the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but they are mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create cosmetology aisles in the style of department stores and compete with the chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
This is a significant investment of 2.8 billion pounds in the UK cosmetics market, which is constantly growing, while sales in fashion and household goods are declining. As part of the investment, larger aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If this step is successful, more stores will be added next year.
The cosmetics investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on shelves that once belonged to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its product range to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, as there will be spaces reserved for brands similar to Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its Boutique make-up range to make most of its products available to vegans, which is increasingly required by young consumers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open before the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble department stores. His supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and other than groceries.
Sainsbury's has incorporated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and has also integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains were bought by the company two years ago. According to its representatives, this step increased food sales, making acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to innovate its cosmetics and medicines departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested the partnership with Boots after 2000, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio three years ago. The company owns the LloydsPharmacy chain, and the sales value was 125 million pounds.
The company said the Lloyds chain will play an important role as a wider range of premium skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, will be added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of beauty aisles to make shopping in a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all requirements. The impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' by Holly Willoughby's 11 million pound contract
'Dragons' Day' star Peter Jones 'infuriated' that TV host Holly Willoughby had terminated her 11 million pound contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of interior accessories and Truly accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop.
The host of This Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that she is quitting.
Holly Willoughby infuriated the star of Peter Jones’s Dragons’ Den show by backing out of a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new mega-contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when a golden girl on television during a nervous meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire admitted that the new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant she would no longer have enough time to devote to their brand of interior accessories and True accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated ’11 million fortune.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew away from Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Project Truly was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
It was to be her long-term future, and she was to secure it for several decades to come.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was happening. The launch was so close.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which is one of the most lucrative stars of Britain, can cost the company millions. This is due to huge investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, but also the possibility of further delays in marketing.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby proposed Project Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became director in March.
The two couples spend holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin, who hosts I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on business matters.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that awaits him from the media for his comment. Some will consider her an “unworthy president” and will reproach him for saying so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with a mocking “moderator” voice.
“I didn’t sacrifice anything.”
He noted that after the initial joint meeting in Singapore in June, Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a great step on the way to the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Negotiations for the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s chief diplomat, Ri Jong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an “adequate response” from the US to North Korea’s first steps on disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. instead continues to impose sanctions in order to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were in danger of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - an end to missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also advocated an unusual way of talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there trying to get in, instead there would be 200 people out there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged one of the islands and killed hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to leave their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary condition for obtaining international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it’s a bit difficult,” she said.
Although Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will have the opportunity to work in the field.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Due to the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country's preparedness for the anger of nature is deplorable.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Pal is likely to have contributed to the large number of casualties, despite the fact that there was an active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was on Lombok to provide care for the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign to improve Indonesia's disintegrated infrastructure. He spent generously on roads and railways.
However, Widod’s administration is suffering from a lack of funds, and he is again facing elections next year.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure over the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, as supporters of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed in street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs, and tens of thousands more were forced to flee their homes using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from FC Liverpool from a distance equalized against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League. He scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate. His team was losing 1-0 at the time.
He flipped the ball to the left and sent a shot to the far center.
His attempt glides high above the penalty area and heads to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga into the net.
“I was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to play as much forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made one touch. I didn't think much about it and I fired."
Chelsea led after halftime 1:0. In the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored for her.
The Blues forward returned the pass to Mateo Kovačić, turning in the middle of the field and sprinting in half of Liverpool.
Kovačić showed a quick bump in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a beautiful penetration pass, which with Hazard headed to the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and ended up with a more distant pole when he overtook Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool face off against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will battle Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 3:00 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, has filled the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come forward to testify.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything with an on-board camera to contact us as they may have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene, thinking they knew the woman, and they wanted to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is ongoing and police said they are now informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he couldn’t say anything.
The owners of the apartments are now learning that they will be able to get inside again in a few hours.
One police officer was heard telling another man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was out.
Several policemen were standing in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, citing protocol 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s statue in front of parliament is the latest monument in a dispute over “rewriting history”
Its removal would be gratification for the fact that its fanatical Puritan adherents such as the Taliban have destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
However, the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "foolish" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent production of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft testifies to his perception in the 19th century and is part of the history of a personality who, according to many, still deserves respect."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more than today, as a protector of parliament from outside forces, in his case of course a protector of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description of reality, historians continue to debate.
What is certain, however, is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique personality who embodies one side of this controversy.
The achievements he has achieved as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and respect."
A Pig Slammed a Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southeastern China.
A man, who is only referred to by the surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and drenched in blood near a market in Liu-phan-shui prefecture in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing a vaccine in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of the next house was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with a bloody muzzle.
According to the report, the court investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram boar had bruised the farmer to death.
“The cousin had bloody and crushed legs,” said a cousin named Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security cameras, Yuan came to the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager for Evening News said the pig was separated so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although attacks by pigs on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains in many places in the southwest of the US.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring torrential rains in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the US.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, located 620 km southwest of the Mexican outcrop of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins to push deep tropical moisture north to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimetres of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture then combined with the approaching trough will create extensive and dense rains in the southwest in the coming days.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of rainfall will fall, which will cause severe dangerous floods, flooding of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rains, during which 5 to 8 millimeters of precipitation per hour will fall pointwise, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, precipitation is expected to range from 5 to 10 centimeters.
Violent floods can occur, as conditions deteriorate rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Given the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to go on foot in the desert.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in canyons, with thunderstorms locally bringing fierce winds with dust in the air.
The approaching trough in some parts of the coast of southern California will cause heavy local rains.
It can fall more than 13 millimeters of precipitation, which could cause, to a lesser extent, the flooding of debris and the slipperyness of the roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
Late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, scattered showers from tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona. Rain will already be widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the states of the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
There may be significant temperature fluctuations throughout the US in October, as the Arctic cools while the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at a short distance.
A great example of a rapid temperature change is Wednesday in the United States.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, it will try to reassert and expand the lingering summer heat.
In the middle and east of the US, a warm beginning of October is expected in many places. In several territories from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast, the temperature will exceed 26 degrees.
In New York City, it could be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US throughout the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was followed by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the impressive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford reportedly took place in the 1980s.
It wasn’t until Friday that radio and television stations stopped broadcasting for a last-minute turnaround: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal under which the FBI could investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was teasing her and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers, announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with office audience measurement.
By comparison, a similar number of spectators watch a playoff match of American football or the Oscars.
On average, 5.69 million viewers watched Fox News Channel, whose opinion-forming moderators strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, according to Nielsen during the day-long interview, which is the most among all networks.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high even after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning. Protesters shouted at him as he tried to get the elevator to interview the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down and listened to the live coverage of CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one of the women.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
Someone said to him, “You have great power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
All cable and other networks went live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee over the next week, something the minority Democrats are urging.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had a lot of power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of 'playing political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused those who criticize her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with the future of Britain and distorting national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which is next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her plan in the framework of Brexit, which is likened to the game of the lady. He said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other is "completely absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: police in connection with the death of the LSU player arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested the suspect who allegedly shot and killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson. Police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
Police seized the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to WAFB, a partner of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Sims.
According to the defense attorney, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for “the diligence and enforcement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-centimeter-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
“That’s what you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash on Mexico City
The ash that flows from Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The centre has experienced noise and tremors several times.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windows in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot police. Thousands more participated in parallel demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession, which divides society.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by riot police, who threw eggs and powdered paint, and so the streets, where it was sometimes teeming with tourists, were full of dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, there were also skirmishes. The police used batons to get the thugs under control.
Within a few hours, a group of independence supporters who chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist Protestants who shouted “Long live Spain.”
According to reports in the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but Catalan separatists celebrated it.
A large majority of the voters chose independence, but the turnout was low, as opponents of secession boycotted the vote to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police in violent clashes tried to make it impossible to continue voting in polling stations across the area.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it had to go in a different direction.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
My parents were crying with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he says.
Although Catalan political parties demanding independence in the regional elections last December achieved a close (but important) victory, this year they are no longer able to successfully continue. Many of their most famous leaders have themselves gone into exile or are waiting in custody for a trial for their participation in the holding of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who shoots the protest in support of police by phone, says politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is showing us,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent at approximately 19:30 UK DST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said both the gates and the building were damaged.
In addition, there may have been a shooting at the car from the crossbow.
Meng's goal marked Livingston's victory over Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga secures first goal for Livingston
Livingston shocked the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard only a second loss in 18 games since taking over as Ibrox coach.
Dolly Meng's hit proved decisive, with Gary Holt's team reaching the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still out of the Premiership this season, and he will face Hearts next Sunday, behind which he is eight points behind.
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his invincibility streak in the league to six games. Head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has still not experienced the bitterness of losing.
Livingston Burns Chances Against Crippled Guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the goal.
Scott Robinson penetrated, but his attempt passed in front of the gate. Alan Lithgow's ending was then directed only next to him as he slid Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The home-satisfied let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests from standard situations.
That’s how the decisive goal was scored.
Livingston managed to break through, Declan Gallagher and Robinson found Menga after the combination and he scored from the center of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but were unable to overcome home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's attempt was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow ended Livingston's next-to-standard situation.
The centre was constantly moving into the Livingston 16 and the defence was constantly turning them away. The players were demanding a penalty twice - after Halkett's move on the alternate Glenn Middleton and after the alleged hand - but the referee allowed the game to continue.
"Phenomenal" Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All players as one man were exceptional. On their way up, they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of the game and the players in the team have hardly changed since returning to the highest competition, but Holt deserves great recognition for how the team has risen since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible. He managed a perfectly organized defense, while Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall rest the whole match.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played very well under Gerrard several times, but they did not reach this level.
They missed the final pass - they only made it past home defense once - and for Rangers in the middle of the table, it's a raised warning finger.
Erdogan not only received a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany. The purpose of the visit is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque there.
The largest number of Turks live outside of Turkey.
Police said for security reasons they had prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but there were many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of whom were Kurds) were also aware of Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Contradictory protests show a difference of opinion about this guest. Some German Turks invoke him as a hero, while others condemn him for autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. It is a busy road in Deptford in the south-eastern part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics came to the scene, but the cyclist succumbed to injuries on the spot.
The accident occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who fled the scene of the accident. This accident happened on Childers Street, about 1.5 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police were trying to identify the man and inform relatives.
There is a closed road, diverted bus service and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
Six prison guards were injured in the riots at the men’s high-security prison, according to a prison report.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time at the Long Lartin British Prison in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Tornado special forces were called to the scene to bring the riots under control, with eight prisoners being held responsible and managed to separate them into one wing.
Minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident at the British Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
More than 500 prisoners are serving their sentences at Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had ended up in hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In addition, an anti-revolt unit was called to the prison in October to end the serious riots, when the prisoners attacked the guards with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (areas affected by drought may benefit)
Tropical low pressure in Arizona is an exceptional phenomenon. However, it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is directed through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for the area from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecast for Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix noted that only “ten tropical cyclones within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix have had tropical storm or pressure below status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, while in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona it may be up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 millimeters, exceptionally it can be up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no risk of flooding, rain caused by dew can be useful, as the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first head over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican outcrop of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm has hit the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and is losing its intensity.
Therefore, when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to have the power of a tropical storm.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
“A total of 75 to 150 millimetres of precipitation is expected between Baja California and the northwest of Sonora, and in some places it may be as high as 250 millimetres,” Weather.com reported.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north until she reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical downward pressure storm, which will then head up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late in the evening on Tuesday.
“The greatest threat to Rosa or her remains is a very large amount of rainfall in the Baja California region, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening torrential floods and flooding of debris in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three boys between the ages of 17 and 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a "stabilized" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area, police in the Avon and Somerset area said.
Police are asking all those who have registered the incident with their mobile phone to come forward to testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered the meanness and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and repulsive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said before a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday. He abruptly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey-Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also pleaded guilty to the charges at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people had the opportunity to see Kavanaugh's uniqueness, character and courage that day."
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most respected legal experts of the time and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service," he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“There are five weeks left until the elections, which are among the most important in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m doing my best to support exceptional candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats’ goal was to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to be on the agenda on Friday at the latest, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives and many were carried away by the waves when huge waves caused by the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when in the evening they encountered waves up to six meters high on the coast. Waves destroyed everything that stood in their way, and many people came and life.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach. They didn’t run away right away and became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone. It took away cars, beams, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before it hit the coast.
He said that in an attempt to escape the tsunami, some people climbed a tree and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 resorts in Pal.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in this coastal town.
There have been several earthquakes in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake exceeded the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima about 200 times.
The intensity of the tsunami could have been increased by the location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, department stores and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, located 300 km along the coast north of Palu, as the area is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication was "completely crippled" and there was "no information available" from Donggaly, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday that it had not reported the Palu tsunami, but authorities said the waves had arrived at a time when a warning had already been issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building is heard shouting desperate warnings at people on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the record.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communication with the city of Palu and the surrounding area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
Authorities said the army had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other places to help, but the evacuated people were still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been re-opened for aid aircraft only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Pal on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala made it safely to the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in the tarpaulin shelters created in the office yard, they walked through the destroyed areas on the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups embarked on a difficult task and began to work on reconstruction after the disaster, some of them complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Pal.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and workers from other countries can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says it's a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid, but that hasn't happened yet."
When Palu was the second night after the quake and tsunami on Friday, the families and friends of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle in the bleak story of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped for two days among the ruins with the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, coached two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“Since I’ve been doing paragliding for a long time, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse swept around the paragliding community, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to contestants in Pal who attended the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one grey check mark instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Replenishing an ATM in the Newport on the Levee Area
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who replenished an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a report.
While he was busy, another man “runs out from behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money to put in.
According to the report, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have information regarding their identity, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “An entity officially known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is to present his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the participation for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has in the past stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
From the word Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, came Ye. It reflects what is good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album is more about who we are.”
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also presents himself with a hyphen and without a hyphen and both upper and lower case letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never, under any circumstances, use the military to overpower the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired on peaceful protesters, killing up to 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to take hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. to double investment in artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this sphere. This was stated by investor and promoter of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after various U.S. government entities made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China presented its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation.
“Since all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we’re trying to make another breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI), a double budget for AI would be a good start,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of another big success in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the top-ranked U.S. player under the name Othello, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the CEO of Google’s Chinese subsidiary.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help reveal future visionaries.
As Lee said, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders away from us, it’s big corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired the best minds from universities to work for them on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in AI.
“I think that holders of a PhD in AI should be automatically offered a green card,” he said.
China’s State Committee released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distributing money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from the industrial and academic community. The White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
At the same time, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment this month for an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In contrast, U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Citizens of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." This move would resolve a dispute with Greece, stretching for decades, that has blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments drew up an agreement in June to include the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a prize worth admitting Macedonia, a country that emerged after the demise of Yugoslavia, into communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future for the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the will of voters and make decisions based on the outcome.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities during the referendum until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum to change the country's name to allow it to join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, put a small podium in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents set by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I am convinced that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
The poll, published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday, said 30 to 43 percent of voters were preparing for a referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those surveyed, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum’s failure would mark the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to the leadership last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero overtakes Brighton's entire defence and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England broke the Brighton defense and secured a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguer's elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He went through three Brighton defenders and ran into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed past one defender and then circled a few more on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left, where the ball found Sterling.
The English forward touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguer, who right-handedly overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguera has some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal in that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Cityzens the opening advantage in the Premier League.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got to the ball deep in Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling towards the far pole.
The attacker Cityzens touched the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
City is set to face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances for the Rockies
When the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there wasn’t much reason to push for another start.
But Scherzer hopes to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, even if the consequences may still be for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the NL.
By a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have at least retained their wild card option, but they still need to confirm their first division title.
Even if we’re not playing for anything, at least we can still get on the pitch with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and an opponent, this will probably be the highest level we’ll get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.”
The Nationals have not yet announced the first pitcher for Sunday, but it seems likely they will let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, threw a bullpen on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, when he normally has a rest day.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 record with a score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly pointed to the situation around his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve achieved will be at stake.
There are five weeks remaining until the most important election of our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity, and even though I’m not running, I’m actually running, so I’m going up and down the country fighting for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats. It's happening right in front of our eyes.
They are determined to win back power by any means, mean and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, went on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“You could have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, mean and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with loud booing from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hm, hm, what?
No, um, no, I, wait - her body language was really bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists voted for my reprimand, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour Members to be told that he is no longer welcome - all for expressing an opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the reprimand motion criticized that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was the importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically, in fact, similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting for Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are not carried in such a tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if ever applied.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy got in the lead because colleagues I had previously thought shared a similar political stance suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a tirade of criticism on social media, calling for an appeal, giving up the politics of the centre and listening as if I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face the holocaust of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how the level of attacks has normalized.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the notorious liberals, and with every incentive to express 'distrust' or change the rules of choice, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
Over the past two years, a lot of people have advised me not to stand out too much from the crowd, be quiet and keep up, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the indifference of the Thatcher government, which allowed my high school class to literally collapse, I have tried to promote better public services for those who needed it most, whether in the local council or the ministry.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
The only thing I would say to those who supported the move on Friday is that as the country creeps towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy trying to address my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not from the Momentum initiative in Nottingham. It is for the people of my constituency, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to have served you and I promise you that no threats of appeal or political calculus will deter me from trying to enforce what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr gets to the top
Two late attempts may have waved the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this stunningly engaging match of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
He is now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the victory brought home a great defense, as well as better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to joy.
“We’ve had a lot of tests during the matches and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hats off to Ayr, they took a chance better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt to convert Frazier Climo put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to outnumber him, and Jason Baggot made an untransformed attempt.
Climo took the lead with a penalty and then, at exactly half-time, scored a solo attempt, allowing Ayr to take a break with a score of 17-5.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This was followed by a lengthy delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was weaned, and as soon as the game began to continue, Ayr came further into the lead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
Acting Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then given the yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it in the form of an unaltered attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under intense pressure.
However, the home side came to life again and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting the Clime without the ball, MacPherson achieved a touch-down from a penalty shootout with an approaching horde of Ayr behind his back.
Climo transformed, as he did almost at the beginning of the event, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away on the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of the series Still Game embarks on a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be starting a career in services. According to our information, he was appointed as the director of the company with a license to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC programme that he writes and stars in along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be their last, and Kiernan appears to be already planning a life outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang (the show's set).
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a “blooming restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to restore access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors besiege the naval headquarters in La Paz dressed in sails.
There are blue flags in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titikaka to the Amazon are marked by the motto: “The sea is our right.
It’s our duty to get him back.”
Across Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coast lost in favor of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to roam the waters of the Pacific Ocean again.
After five years of hearings, Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
“Bolivia is on the rise, has a spirit of unity and balance, and of course believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the international court on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, so that after decades of adjourned negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate for granting sovereign access to the sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who will take part in a controversial re-election campaign next year, also has a say in Monday’s decision.
“Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach,” he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia - and even if it did, not much would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s statement comes just six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there can be no doubt about the Bolivian arguments, it is possible that she has taken a step back in recent years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric undermined all remaining accommodating Chile, she hinted.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue to negotiate, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The two countries have not had embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision would be unusually quick.
Monday will provide Bolivia with "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements and achieve mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - would use the maritime question as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Rejects Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will not be the first to get rid of nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that continued US sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country very likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest trends in impressive headwear, which you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your hat collection or perfectly protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unusual oversized headwear in their Spring/Summer 19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed viewers at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the catwalk.
A unique piece from Valentino was a voluminous beige hat decorated with a down roof that covered the heads of models.
Other supplements of excessive size included a melon inlaid with precious stones, a magic hat, and even pineapple - but these are not meant to warm you up.
Thom Browne also performed a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, even with a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion expressions - you're lucky.
Style experts predict that huge hats will also make it to the usual stores in your area.
Oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a roof 60 centimeters wide, worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that lurked behind every corner of social media sent another big creation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model clad in a swimsuit carrying it.
A ruff bag of tan orange color, framed by fringes of a raffia and complemented by a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to come to regular stores next summer - since the designer has been such a huge influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: No global citizen can do without language skills
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic performance and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of extraordinary exam results, further enhancing individual and collective achievement in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, careers as they see fit, and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement tailor-made school curricula, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and demanded subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you are speaking to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the chart with the highest grade point average among independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A grade in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons cited by employers as problems in filling jobs were language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities are created that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, as long as he has learned a second language, with such a lifelong ability he will have a real advantage in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak any foreign language enough to be fluent in conversation, with French being the only language in which the number of people reached double-digit percentages (15 per cent).
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of countries with developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages continue to be fundamentally important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be called “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be ready.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James commented on his plans for a schedule of six Lakers preseason games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any more preparatory games to start,” he said.
Trump Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump today began a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s planned meetings next week, including stops at related locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After abstentions from his Supreme Court candidate, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterms as Republicans risk losing control when they vote in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the current Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing, which has been strained over allegations of sexual harassment, with the Senate confirmation vote postponed for a week while FBI investigations are underway.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who are looking forward to the difficult November elections, regain their strength.
According to Reuters, the five meetings next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that when he enters a busy election season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s meeting, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, a country where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to back West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, whose poll preferences lag behind.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to pick up his poll preferences,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Courage to Fight and Hopes to Succeed in Sunday’s Individual Clashes
After three one-sided series, foursome matches on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum of the driving force is an invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the momentum is on now?
“They led by six points, now it’s only four, so we could say we have a slight momentum now,” Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for his competition day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, a four-point lead and another twelve in the game.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel a slight wind in their sails and have quite a lot of reason to hope, thanks, among other things, to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each earned three points out of four.
Spieth was unsurpassed from the tee to the last hole and leads others by his example.
As his round progressed, the throaty cheers became louder, sinking the key putt and the fourth match was indecisive when he and Thomas had two each by two less.
His putt, which won them the match at 15, celebrated with a similar cry, which proves his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to roll up your sleeves and start thinking about your own game,” Spieth said.
There is nothing left for any of the players.
18 holes where you have to get the maximum.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favorites of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and has no way to make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the stormy crowd and the players confirms that these players will have to be beaten on Sunday, and it is hard to find a more popular player to cement a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both are best at the same time.
However, talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played in a pair with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes excavated a Spanish and a Swede pit from which they were no longer able to dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you dig your way out of the pit.
The fourball and foursome matches are fascinating when viewed closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a substantial lead to the final day, but these foursome rounds have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight, which some, especially on the American continent, doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-some games with the lead against the United States 10:6.
Encouraged, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to add four points to their Le Golf National account so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, with an effort to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the failing American side in the early fourball games and won the series 3-1.
In foursomes, the Americans offered more resistance, winning two matches, but failed to erode their deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari, nicknamed “Molliwood”, they are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they clinched their performance excellently, defeating the downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau for an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who bowled two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 four-ball and four-some games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the early fourball games, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome and together they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the number one and number three in the world rankings.
But Europe didn’t have it easy on that pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a skewed 2&1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball matches and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in four-game matches after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team managed to get out of a four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Furyk's side as the defending champion only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two whole days, however, it seems that Sunday’s counterattack will probably be beyond their strength.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Institution’s annual general assembly that North Korea has taken “substantial accommodative steps” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
“We don’t see any response from the United States,” he added.
“Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his position was crucial in that he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea a security guarantee.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to release severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. first insists on nuclear disarmament and increases the level of tension through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way and even by objecting to a ‘declaration to end the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the US, disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not get into such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech differed dramatically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil” Trump called Kim a “suicidal mission rocket.”
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, sang praise for Kim at the UN for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions had to remain until North Korea was free of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable, saying it “doesn’t matter if it takes two, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue rigorously and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle both the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him the "corresponding measures" he expected were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
The goal of this year’s course at Harvard University is to get all students more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of studying all night long with the help of caffeine.
Researchers have found that students at a world-leading university are often clueless when it comes to the complete basics of taking care of their health.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in the Brigham and Women’s Clinic, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture he gave on sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and sports performance while improving general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to open the course when it found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section, the screen shows a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and how important a regular sleep regimen is.
In the next section, participants will learn how a long-term sleep deficit can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about it, just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to have been able to learn all night, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, even against weight gain because sleep deficits put the brain into starvation mode, so they feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step it will be possible to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before embarking on a challenging study.
Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to become aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emanating from electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of grief at the outdoor game when Dolly Menga's shot doomed Steven Gerrard's battered team to a 1-0 loss at Livingstone.
Guests from Ibrox tried to record their first win out since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only brought Gerrard his second defeat for 18 games as manager, leaving his team at the position of 8 points from the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership table, which are Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of halftime, and the Rangers lineup, lacking inspiration, did not even come close to evening out.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third and lags behind Hibernian with only one goal difference.
And Rangers may have other problems after line referee Calum Spence sustained a head injury as he was struck by an object apparently thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and subsequently the Rangers overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same eleven Livi that took away the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled at how his well-matched team strangled their opponents in every event.
Rangers may have dominated in possession of the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were to score only in the second minute of the match, when Meng's first recall from the field sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long straight kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to miss the back pole by far.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have hope rather than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty after a quarter-hour game when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was barely upset by Lassan Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been in conflict with the course of the game, no one can argue that they deserved it just for their efforts.
The Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' corner again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball through a slit to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took the break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the winger found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the type of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side could stretch their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then withstood Lithgowa's wide head from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton later claimed a penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson overlooked it again.
The inventor of the Geiger computer
And now we have a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an integral part of science to this day, also became a staple of pop culture when he was discussed in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by the cowboys who smelled science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s computer, detecting radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the sounds of atoms being produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Really, I can hear them crackling!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells in Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They then “see” the protein common to many types of cancer and inject themselves back in.
The vaccine tested shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, disappeared from ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient’s immune cells are extracted, modified in a laboratory to “see” a protein common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “learning” how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, has been criticized for his support of Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third track called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the words Make America Great on it, he launched an attack against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“I talked to a white man so many times and he said to me, ‘How can you recognize Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was a racist, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday Night Live (SNL) show began with a scene with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make West look ridiculous by sharing it.
West also complained to the audience that he had had a hard time behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go in there with that hat on.’
I was usually bullied!
And then they told me I was down," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how I am at the bottom? I will put on my Superman cape because it means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments received booing from the audience at least twice, and others performing in the SNL were embarrassed, Variety magazine reported, with one person saying to the media, "There was grave silence throughout the studio."
West was invited as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West was supported by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “A message to one of our bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BEING AGAINST THE MASS.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “simply was himself and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I am determined not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothing brand, or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, also had the name Snoop Lion, and there is, of course, the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be assessed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Condemns Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO’s harsh medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a male hero and said that for such characters on screen, young boys often feel that they need to be tough to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said: “Something is getting out of hand and thinking about how to tackle toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, admitted that solving the problem was “very important.”
“I personally feel it’s very important to address where something has gotten out of hand in the masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men during adolescence when the problem we see now arises?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity for its overly masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What does television teach, and what is happening on the streets that young boys feel they must have this particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change it?
Because it’s clear that something has gotten out of hand with young men.”
He also admitted in an interview that when the series ends next summer, he will no longer be filming any prologues or sequels to Game of Thrones, as he has "already finished with the battlefields and the horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“Thanks to this show, I met my wife, so in a way she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, she played Rose Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As a result of conservative country values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with a man eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies letting her employee leak GOP senators' data, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters rejected allegations that a member of her staff had sent the personal data of three Republican U.S. Senators to the legislator's Wikipedia page.
A Democrat from Los Angeles says the allegations come from “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, leaked by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks were linked to Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
“This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for leaking that information.
This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Her denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not commit, they must not be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the plaintiff's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running for Waters' seat in the interim election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified the authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and are held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: An Undersized Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British point of view, and this also applies to this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English - which was first introduced in 2003 by the film Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 in the film Johnny English Returns.
Will there be an ironic self-satire about how obviously incapable we are of a new national export article?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his distinctive facial expressions, has gained the opportunity to spoil everything again - with his name signaling better than anything else that he is a generous comic creation designed especially for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, the clumsy undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims of gentle glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a spoonful of that guy who contributed a single note to the opening tune of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character was originally based on an international traveler and mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this latest Johnny English adventure, one or two sweet moments can be found.
I liked how Johnny English comes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller slightly hits his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident here, but humor sounds a bit undersized and strangely superficial, especially when “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as one of their ingredients.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s strange adventures aren’t as inventive and apt as Mr. Bean’s wordless Atkinson gags.
The current background of the film's story is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web spy network and, to the dismay of a low-profile agent, Kevin Eldon, has revealed the identities of all the British agents in the area.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and combative figure who is already on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a quasi-Terese May figure, but she has little to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to call someone to retire.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene, now employed as a director at a posh institution, who gives private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some nice gags, as English gives lessons in spying in the style of School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his longtime sidekick, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, strapped to an affectionate submarine commander, for the role of which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a shame.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disasters in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in the field and encounter a beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova, performed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously succumbs to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd skirmishes: in disguise as waiters, they set fire to a gleaming French restaurant; cause chaos when they sneak onto Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volt's house.
All the tricks are pulled from the sleeve in the last minutes, but no matter how impressive and stormy they are, the whole thing acts a bit like a children's TV program.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I still have to think about why the British film industry won’t finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies working on plan for UK four-day working week paid as five-day
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should consider a radical plan to give Britons a four-day work week, but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company’s leadership to reallocate the savings obtained by the AI revolution to give workers an extra day off.
It would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but home would carry the same paychecks.
Sources say the idea would “correspond” to the party’s economic plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen from evening to morning, but the four-day workweek is an effort that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour would not be the first to support the idea. The Green Party included the four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet made any efforts.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy, nor is it considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated his determination to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “rich people” in the service sector.
At the same time, the shadow chancellor’s plans mean that the current shareholders in the water companies would not recover their entire shares, as the Labour government could apply “withholdings” due to the found fault.
He also confirmed plans to add employees to company boards and create Inclusive Equity Funds to give 10 percent of private sector equity to employees who could receive annual dividends of up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes: Could Kavanaugh's FBI Investigation Change Their Minds?
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week and raised the question of whether the office’s findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something for which they would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were brought, and I asked, ‘Did you do it?’
He was decisive, determined and unequivocal."
Graham’s voice seems to have been decided.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there would have to be a bulletproof charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied everything,” Graham said, referring to Blasey Ford.
“And no one he appoints can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how anything can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive crowd of stars with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
In their seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers must complete a series of tasks or “events,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or some other meaningful way to raise awareness of the event’s goal of ending poverty.
There are still 12 years to go, so how well does Global Citizen really achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to persuade them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” - where people feel they are actually making a difference when they sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen says they’ve seen more than 19 million “shares” since 2011 from their backers, moving them toward different goals.
The organization says these actions have helped to rouse world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said 390 commitments and statements had been made, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who are committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” while promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition benefits.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “On what basis do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we’re going to fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the personalities who will perform at this year’s event in New York, along with presenters Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to curb Russian energy exports, says Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary,” Washington can call in its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria - where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy there just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe,” he said.
According to him, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States can, with the use of the Navy, ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event, held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the U.S.
He also compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarked on a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow, Trump said.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am convinced that we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position brought resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'seriously consider' 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in the top position,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said on behalf of President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Center of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats that are being talked about in connection with a potential run in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump Meeting About Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin, 26, was drafted on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested Monday and charged with domestic violence.
"As my own son has been going through since he came back, I can identify with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with," she told viewers at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "some come home a little different, tougher, asking if people have respect for what their fellow fighters and airmen and all the other members of the military have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a gun under the influence of narcotics, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. Support Objection to New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker’s objection to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but her asylum application was denied by U.S. authorities on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Representatives of states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a high number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
In the filing, the officials further argued that policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum should never have been designed to solve all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Pal is doubling, and desperate efforts are underway to save those who survived.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It’s very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to sway her restless son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their flooded belongings, and saving everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were bursting at the seams.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Pal, where they treated patients outside for severe aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered the feeling of a devastating earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ through ‘propaganda ads’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advert promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referenced a paid advertisement last Wednesday for the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's top-selling newspaper - after he accused China of wanting to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusations of Beijing meddling in the U.S. election are a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish trade-promoting advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war in which both sides adjust tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade conflict should have hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, both Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his contribution to the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its promotional ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is using America’s venerated tradition of free speech and a free press by posting paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, you will find limited dissenting voices in a newsstand on the streets here in Beijing, and you will not see any real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, as the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected his offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans may miss out on female voters over Kavanaugh debacle
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, analysts warn that it will backfire on them in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding the case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted a last-minute request for an FBI investigation from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, an adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted in the halls of the Senate “November is coming!” as Republicans in the Judiciary Committee decided to continue running for Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross all borders,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say motivation is already high; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially between undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don’t like the president, but often don’t.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed his allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there might be a sharp reaction if Republicans confirmed their support for him.
“This has become one big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Commission, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just the vote of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it’s also how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S.-based group Priorities, which helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided about who to trust at the dawn of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with favors leaning more toward Ford.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, told The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The Solid app allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they’re all available on a single browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that only the user decides who will have access to each type of information.
The company calls it “strengthening personal powers through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s goal is to bring the resources, process, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could start building their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t negotiating with “Facebook and Google about whether they’re going to make a complete change that will completely overturn all of their business models overnight or not.”
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based website.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in discussions about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I see the next era of the web very optimistically,” Berners-Lee added.
Priest Bernard Vann: celebrations of the bearer of the Victoria Cross for the First World War
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated his 100th anniversary in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned of Britain's highest military honour.
In a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "amazingly symbolic" that the board was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed across the firing line and with "most bravery" led the troops forward, while himself disarming three of the field weapons.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions “are something I will never get close to in my life, but it makes me feel deeply humbled.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath at the end of the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to be able to take part in the parade,” adding that “the bravery of a real hero shows the support that many people will give him.”
MMA fans waited until late at the end of Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling finale of the Bellator 206 and ultimately not seeing the main event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 games, including six majors, and was broadcast live throughout the night by Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of the transmission.
Some were really disappointed because they were waiting until the morning especially for this match.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's fairy tale as "some sick joke."
“This is a government order that this content has been inappropriate since 6:00, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
“Yes, it was Peppa Pig.”
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work to ensure that viewers in the UK can watch their broadcasts in the future.
“When I think about repeats, I think we can sort it out somehow,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday morning at six o’clock their time and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday of our time, which is Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it happened, we exchanged a lot of messages, and they weren't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you that won’t happen again.
"We're going to cut it down to five games instead of six - as we normally do - we've tried to give the fans something more and we've stretched it out.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Least Valuable’ for His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior to others because of his sexuality as a teenager - but that's what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said it wasn’t until high school that he realized that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4’s first show Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
A regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off for illness.
As an outcast on the first program with Laverne Daley, he said he felt "less like everyone else during his adolescence because it was not socially acceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls."
In his own words, “Until today, I have truly felt inferior and different, and that has given me the strength and motivation to succeed.”
You wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone after they learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT rights fighter and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give that “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "it surprised him."
Daley got married last year to an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem for them.
“When you live through so much at a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer, “it’s hard to find a peer who has experienced similar successes and misfortunes.”
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole world view" had changed.
“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have only talked about how I needed to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie's my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the idea of death, and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you’re not going to be here anymore so you can sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and he was dead that I was finally able to admit that he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’d dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story also inspired his choice of song - Heather Small's Stream - which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form deposed for Saturday's Ryder Cup games
American Phil Mickelson will reach the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to show himself in better shape so that it is not an unfortunate milestone for him.
Mickelson, who has played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was deposed by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-some games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has been many times before for the US, the five-time winner spent the day alternately cheering and improving his game in the hope of fixing his reputation.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old didn’t shoot straight, which isn’t ideal for the tight Le Golf National course, where bad shots usually come back in long terrain.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t challenging enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesca Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who, in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, managed to win all the matches this week.
If Americans who are four points behind before the start of 12 individual games make a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say otherwise.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed me around the shoulders and said he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has high self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has made a significant contribution to our teams in the past and this week.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized and we felt that this is exactly how we have to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Falda's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual balance sheet.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some incalculable value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him and it was great to watch.
It’s not just in his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows strong leadership may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that a significant lead when entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 game at Valderrame, where the team under captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but nevertheless made it past the finish line with the tightest possible win of 141x2:131x2.
“I always have to remember how strong we were in Valderrama; we had a strong lead in Brookline, where we lost, and we won in Valderrama, but just like that,” Bjorn said in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday he led Le Golf National with a score of 10:6.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that the game is not over yet.
We'll go full throttle tomorrow.
We will stand on the lawn and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the match is not over.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that is what we need to focus on.
“As I’ve said from the start, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but I’m also well aware that we’re up against the other side, the best players in the world.”
Excited about how his players fared on the challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have overtaken events.
We have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow is going to be an individual performance, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re doing well, but standing there on your own will test all your golf skills to the full.
This is a message that players need to remember, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, fellow player Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than the individuals they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the big tournaments on the last day when he was part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing defeated when Europe reached the "Miracle at Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw had encouraged his players to the last day in 1999.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start as quickly as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
When this momentum kicks in one direction, those mid-range games matter a lot.
We created our line-up and placed the boys in a way that we felt we were going to try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, being in the top half of the standings.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I thought we would go all the way,” Bjorn said.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
Local media reported that the latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into service in 2014 as a replacement for aging warships from the Cold War era, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and cost accumulation.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship of a completely new class of frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered after being delivered with worrying problems.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will come as replacements for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known to contain a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals, which should allow the deployment of the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which allowed Germany to demonstrate power overseas, will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of fundamental "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable when deployed on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is considered twice as heavy as similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) versus the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the newest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that German naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, confirmed that the navy actually “does not have ships capable of deployment”.
The government official said that the issue had been repackaged over time as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement vessels had been provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to enlist in the navy.
The National Trust Reveals the Secret Lives of Bats
The new research, which is being conducted on the Scottish Highlands estate, aims to reveal how bats use the land in their food hunts.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the whistling and whistling bats, as well as the bright and water bats in the gardens of Inverewe in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders are placed on key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
Employees of this organization and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of calls of bats and the activity of individual species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work, such as meadow formation, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect grasslands and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats can also be a danger.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of assemblies, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established the first and only dedicated conservation area for bats on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have a wonderful space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of protected trees and all good habitats.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It highlights the importance of inspecting bats before performing maintenance on the property, as it is possible that the unwitting destruction of one maternal assembly site could kill up to 400 females and pups, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb, or destroy their gathering places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in the aid.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know about many of our species how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Claims as Lawyers Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape claims “fake news” and says people want to “make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Juventus attacker Kathryn Mayorga was accused of raping a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers during a live Instagram conversation, calling the allegations “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner into the camera.
“They want to be seen with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
“I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine over the allegations, which they called an "unacceptable report of privacy suspicions."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada, after a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where she was allegedly anally raped.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who had failed by "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "feared of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reassess the deal as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' loss of car makers
The UK would “forever regret” losing its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, trade secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnastone near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnastone.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small Oxford plant a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption of borders, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts in the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to hold more than the daily value of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would have stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to prevent these border controls".
“We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal that will allow us to not just talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would stop, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the Trade Union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and potential obstruction of the investigation by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence, Washington has been gossiping for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of using wiretaps to record talks with Trump and recall the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, with new information that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he “wouldn’t” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The deadline has not been set, it could be this week, I understand the shift to another week given all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
We’ll see and always keep the press informed.”
Some reporters have denied the claim: Sanders has not held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press briefings was not due to resentment towards television reporters who want to dazzle, although she said, "I don't agree with the fact that they want to dazzle."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president is doing more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him,” she added, without providing evidence: “We’re going to look at those numbers.”
Short press briefings will still be ongoing, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and in the last few weeks you’ve seen us really often, there’s going to be a brief press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, having appeared freely and several times bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at National Health Service in Scotland over Brexit fears
The secretary of health wrote to EU staff working at the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish they would stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent residence of EU citizens working as part of their transferred public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on the way out towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent urgent surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured shortly before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and sort of collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was after surgery at a health center in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there are "no details yet about the type/range of injury" and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year university student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before leaving the game he had five total hits, which brought him a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK, raising additional cash to help the homeless, according to new Conservative plans.
This step neutralizes the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
State Treasury Expects to Raise Up to 120 Million Pounds a Year to Help the Homeless
Theresa May announced today that she will charge foreign buyers higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. The additional cash will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success aimed at attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing, and to target high-income people.
An increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, additional funds will support the government in the fight against sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and properties for rent after purchase, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" for the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to more help young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by fighting over land but not using it, and called on May to drop quotas on affordable housing in order to remedy Britain's "housing shame."
Corbyn announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending eviction “without fault.”
It also wants to give more powers to the committees to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my function to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
That means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, we cannot allow it to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy houses as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become manager of Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points away from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after moving with St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in running the club.”
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he feels no fear of such a big club being followed by such respected names because he had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
“For me, success will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could get the club there.
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as head coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from their relegation to the third league and changed St Mirren's team from the verge of relegation to the championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled when joining Alloa.
“I really believed that management was better for me than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing well, I ensured an adequate standard of living and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good in management.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it, which makes me believe I’m in the right place as never before in my entire adult life.”

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat increased sales in British pubs struggling to survive, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data revealed that the pub and bar sector saw sales increase by 2.7% in July, but restaurant sales fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor who compiled the data, said: “Continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8%, with the exception of restaurants that were hit even harder.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
The pubs offering drinks and a bar fared much better than the restaurants, which, taking into account the same factors, saw a decline.
Pubs offering food also saw a decline, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Seems like people just wanted to go for a drink.
Within the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% this month, while food fell 3%.
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to domestic sales.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a year-on-year fall in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful given ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come for operators to offer food at a worse time, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new open operations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand adoption.

One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
Research has revealed that one in five children, some under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Instagram accounts”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of "false Instagram accounts" -- a photo-sharing site.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a safe “main” account that they show to their parents, while also having a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page found a teenage girl urging others to rape her.
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40% of the population between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' on Scottish Athletics committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to capitalise on her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect among the Scottish, British and global athletic communities and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing her to the board of directors,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution and help lead the sport in Scotland."
An American who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and has won four Olympic gold medals together, and who is a regular commentator on the BBC, has suffered a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It is exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing exercises for agility.
Thanks for the encouraging news!”
Breast milk breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has divided views in the online world with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the “world’s quietest breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a dark-hued music video to showcase the freedom the new breast pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a hay-filled barn with cows for a song that contains lyrics like “Yes, I suck milk but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “I pump, I pump, I feed babies, I pump, I pump, I suck my beauties.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, opened up controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video elicited mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it denigrates the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except that we steal their babies from them within a few days of giving birth,” one woman wrote.

Another user commented: “This is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the cub.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk extractors for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song appeared to be "successful".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a breast pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was sucking milk.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I take it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “A fun ad aimed at moms who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they have all danced with discreet breast milk extractors tucked in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on an understanding of the essence that many women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast milk extractor is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold babies and even suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarina, partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development program, commented: “The Elvie breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows, we wanted to put breast milk extraction and all its challenges at the centre, while demonstrating in a fun and telling way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie has appeared in the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children peacefully move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, though monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and procedures introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children thanks to supporters.
Traditionally, the majority of supporters were illegal immigrants themselves, fearing that they would jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country by coming forward with a claim to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the office had arrested dozens of people who had asked to support unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporters’ household are illegal here, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Officials seeking to process child-related matters more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained and not after 60 days as per the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will present themselves via video conference call and not in person to present their case regarding their legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are classified as not eligible for aid will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape, shelter workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months said.
Advocates said these concerns are increasing in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the symptoms of a child suffering are more overlooked due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma that many struggle with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who addressed the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "we will treat them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and an "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" which led the refugees to stay away from home.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem said the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be “removed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members soon in order to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will get a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, although many liberal viewers are likely to hope that his presidency will end the impeachment and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever"!
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the average viewership in prime time on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has a top rating of up to 3.5 million viewers in prime time news nights.
“This is an eye-catcher that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, creator of ABC’s “President in Order” drama program about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny," Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories originating in Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade dispute, whether immigrant families will succeed in reuniting, and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
But it’s already beyond an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a six-hour conversation by a group of experts about a “deeper background” than the source of Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich bomber’s leather jacket (“a rough piece of clothing with arrogance,” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of the stormy descriptions, Mr. Sm.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he does is reminiscent of a reality show that feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the daily airing of Trump’s show with the recurring part of the show and daily plot twists (fighting N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'd fall behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 26 degrees outside on the north bank of Kauai, but he was staying inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t help it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember in the past when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was just a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside is pouring into the mid-term elections.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, resulting in two contenders competing for one seat.
This recently revamped Pittsburgh suburb stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamba, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th District.
The maps were redone after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district touched on campaign funding between the main party financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became well-known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely watched March special election to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight lead.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador Instead of Supporting China, Then Resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners moved Trump's organizational management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to advance and effectively end any assessment of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance of the assembly attached to him by the administration, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new major news or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of Mr. Bolton's debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
Another unexpected event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on a possible obstruction to President Trump’s justice, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face responsibilities in this body just as he is preparing to go back to the electorate and perhaps to the jury of his House members.
That’s a lot of conditions, if I don’t want to imply that the fall of Trump is inevitable, not even its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice in how we can influence the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans now face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was reported in this report that he had proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated on his incapacity to hold office.
Mr Rosenstein says the explanation given by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote mid-term in Congress to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be put to a long winter’s sleep.
I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the coven candles on that table with the hook cross.
I just have to be optimistic about the past.”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers feels optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that winning over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and we believed we could get something and we left with a point.
We may have been successful in the end, but overall the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed more in the second half and we were a better team.
Thursday will be another big night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us I’m sure we can push them and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there’s a factor in why we feel good.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, we have great training.
Let’s hope we can push past last season and be successful.”
Women do not sleep because of the fear associated with retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to their family members.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they won’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, senior vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here’s where you need to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t present your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help you cover those expenses, or self-insurance with your own property, if you have that money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a solicitor for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and arrange for your bills to be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent requires prompt medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s also about who the doctors are going to be,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said an increase in the death toll is expected.
As a result of the crippled communications, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the regent's office in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck the western part of the city of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes hit it regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the execution of a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Mounted Police released on Saturday.
According to the police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the listed crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at a detention center in Mat-Su and is being held on an uncovered $500 bond, KTUU television reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "not guilty, certainly".
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and get a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possessing a gun while in a state of intoxication related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, with an increase in deaths expected in the coming days.
The quake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment not given for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck on October 31 to carry out an attack on a cycle route along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and a cyclist on the route.
According to the Death Penalty Notice filed in New York’s Southern District, if prosecutors want to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injury.
Both of these charges are subject to the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight counts of murder with intent to blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “disgusting, cruel and perverse.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” the report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time New York City passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The couple had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also requested the display of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
At the 22-point indictment, he said he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and living in prison without parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
A former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “run into an awkward situation” from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s parliamentarians suggested he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would be "already gone" if Mr Farage were secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in easing her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by Conservatives for remaining, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, pro-remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted on continuing to seek a deal with Brussels despite opposition, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the “chaos.”
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to remove the Prime Minister.
He suggested to Mr Farage to get involved and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to take down the prime minister.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU saying, "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone dismissed views that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The prime minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for her, it’s unpopular with our party and our activists, who are actually tearing down the streets and putting us first.
Please leave the Prime Minister and start listening."
She added: “Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians must “feel anger” if they betray the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilising the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham for a stay and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit. The group was formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have information systems in place and all the technology for a border without friction and for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "think carefully" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting on Saturday in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was rumored that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at City Hall since Trump took office.
He asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in the top position.”
Arrested in the shooting of Sims from LSU University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of basketball player LSU Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who is being captured on video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near Southern University's college dormitory early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," Murphy police chief J. Paul told media on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter junior player, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders win over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes team orders will play a significant role in the race.
From the best starting position Bottas got a good start and almost put Hamilton in an awkward position, defending his position in the first two corners and challenging Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first walked into the pits and let Hamilton walk into the traffic on the group's tail, which was supposed to be crucial.
Mercedes went to the pit stop a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close overtaking in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside at the risk of having to defend himself a third time after a double move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race as he held on to the road and focused on a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
He eventually made it to the pits in the 44th round, but failed to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, it has an exceptional combination of two strong personalities," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not deal directly with the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead noting that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "various, repulsive, and dishonest."
“One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at disclosures and leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t do that.”
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you posted this?
Remember her answer... you published a document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, wait a minute.
We published ... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter was published in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't publish her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill newspaper reported.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
However, her denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who said during Saturday’s rally: “I’ll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but she had the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats were using the claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power by all necessary means.
You see meanness, indecentness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control.”
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee hockey team
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a 5-3 match on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants team gained a timely two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowie, the home team equalized, but Dwyer subsequently reinstated the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, but subsequently gave Lukas Lundvald Nielsen two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score and defeated the Dundee team 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the rivals, having won the Giants in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m. assisted by Kendall McFaull and four minutes later assisted by David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening leg, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cowie's 15:16 settlement.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the team to the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored again in a goalless game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead in the second leg for the first time in the match, and he secured the win in the middle of the last leg.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home at Milton Keynes in the following match on Friday.
Air traffic operator dies to secure escape of plane with hundreds of passengers before earthquake
An air traffic operator in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died securing the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to plague the area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the wildly swaying tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed put to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation service, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were very sad when we found out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The disaster relief agency in the country says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number is likely to continue to grow as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people could not be reached," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
“Small markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earthquakes struck Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air Niugini reports one man missing in lagoon after plane crash
The airline operating the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, says one man is missing, after previously saying they had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it found one man missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and what was the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway began.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“It was a great luck,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to wade up the strip of deep water to the emergency exits in a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier were also assisting in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases suggest that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
An analyst sets a timeline for the night during which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution completed the indictment on Saturday in a re-opened case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He sketched for the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis to the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening she died, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, with Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to make final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the court to go before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed says hip-hop has shifted away from its origins to political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-pop the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are experiencing renewed fame in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple over 'racist' text
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly sent text message from a mother who complained she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on her first day in 2016.
“NIEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after the "shameful" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her misstep, she fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that their outgoing babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Ms Maurice is now suing the couple for dismissal compensation and is seeking $350 per day for a six-month period, for working with the employer she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that these things are not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to claims that they were racists, defended themselves, and argued that Mrs Maurice's termination was a sensible thing to do because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post newspaper.
“But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife was only two months old and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public quickly denounced the couple on social media, alluding to their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington's Publishers Worried Readers Won't Be Related to Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to find yourself in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we now know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said that the father was optimistic about the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about the little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "bittersweet" for his death last year.
She added that Paddington's eventual success, which she describes as "a very important member of our family", was quietly proud of her father.
“He was a calm man and not a praiser,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me it was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me and told me that he would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart functioning slowly faded and left her system.
She died a short time ago, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could neither cry nor cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers, regardless of the suffering she had suffered.
“Nobody knew about it,” she said.
“I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt tremendous compassion for Nada.
I knew he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women's messages prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have come for suicide about their loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post links to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile would brighten up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that it will have a chain effect."
Ms. Davis created the messages “to let people know that there are people you can come and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Davies' longtime girlfriend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, the partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Eve, he was at the very bottom of the day, when the children opened their presents and didn’t even look at them.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get through it: “It will create a hole across the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could really achieve what he was asking for, either a limited investigation or a limited investigation, we could agree on something,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “break up” in the middle of an obstacle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
Elections in the middle of the term are only five weeks away, on November 6, if Republicans are not expected to succeed, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they have elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the tiebreaker and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's deserters 'decrease' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been falling since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 deserters last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the north will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, officials from both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on suspended denuclearization talks.
This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work on a nuclear-free peninsula in a broader sense.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was due to US sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to disarm unilaterally at first,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', says he is unable to serve on Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suited to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did, they would say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school period.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated type of assassination" orchestrated by liberals angered over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Ms Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony would prove he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it would prove he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he persecutes the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was evasive when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not just fit to be on the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to be on the court he’s on right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roe v. Wade because she considers herself a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questions in his hearings about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court rulings.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t it wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
Women have to control it.
It’s a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can’t be restrained, and she can’t talk about it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a leading worker somewhere, and she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great."
Tears are sometimes allowed as a way out of anger because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of an early job in a predominantly male office, where I once cried out of indescribable rage, is when an elderly woman, a cold manager I’ve always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the back of the head and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they got under your skin.”
Patricia Schroeder, a later Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his bid for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended her candidacy, a deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not be concerned with the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already started, she was behind on raising funds, so she promised not to enter the game if she didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
“Do they think there’s a left on me?” she wondered.
During her talk of not launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she choked.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
“The one who cried?”
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the conflict between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time, recently placing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to come to terms with U.S. tactics, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
Making concessions to Washington would mean yielding to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public acknowledgment of the US would be even more embarrassing.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the US trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one country is actually much more dangerous than we have previously observed,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugee return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation here is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe confirms victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, batted his first shot into the water on the 16th hole with par 3 and gave up his match in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds and became one of four players to play 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the lowest-ranking player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, succumbed to 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played at his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the record European winner of tournaments with a career score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy that the cup is coming back.
It's about the team. I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said under the influence of emotions after the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes at the remaining hole in the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournament record.
Special statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the right path except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk stepped out after an unsatisfactory performance in front of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
The time has come this morning to make Europe uncomfortable.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will form a group again, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to have been a captain.
Hats off.
You have defeated us."
Current state of red sludge: Concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red slurry concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, there are inconsistent conditions related to the coating, indicating declining concentrations.
Red sludge extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but on a smaller number of sites compared to last week.
Red mud was also observed in the Pasco area.
Medium concentrations on or off the coast in the Pinellas area were reported last week, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in the Manatee area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Sarasota area, medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Lee area, and low concentrations in the Collier area.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
