Civil Rights Movement issues travel alert to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued warnings to people of color traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel advice to the state of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to heed heightened attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents currently occurring across the state," the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said the move was based on current Missouri state laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
“We have the highest number of complaints so far.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued to the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated insults directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody without charges of committing a crime.
The travel advice also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of a travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring money to pay the bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel in the state."
According to current FBI program numbers, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, placing the state at sixteenth place among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on charges of violating that law, which the ACLU says is designed to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for Foreign Countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is not at peace!
The victim is model Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the meticulous criminal work of looking into the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted assaulting a minor in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
After three years, the police arrested him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting on fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and charged him.
After confessing, Dixie talked about his horniness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at her ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people out there digging these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror's mother, Linda, told The Associated Press.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimacy.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
“Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different,” she tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in Prague’s Benediktská Street, he runs the Intimacy boutique, where he sells erotic gadgets in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are commonly offered.
Why wouldn't I?
They are also design objects.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, come on, don't be such purists!
The Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to.
No covered windows, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to accommodate the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"Intimacy has something to do with it, and it's also, you might say, tender," she says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the winner was a variant that spread the store into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem perfect because he wasn’t on the main street, but because of that, he was sitting down to the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It is in the alley next to the main one, so no one looks at the customers," praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with brand-name nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered into such a trade at all.
When I walked into the intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the sex store.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, it does not mean that a man’s foot will not come here to ask for help.
Most men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
“Men usually don’t know the right size and prefer a bigger one,” Martin smiles at a common mistake.
It's such a prejudice, such a cliché that women need some great tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith will choose, for example, a unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer mostly black underwear, while women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the expression on my face, it must be clear that I don’t know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a touchless clitoral stimulator.
There is an adolescent need in me to be amazed at the serious tone with which my interpretation is given.
It's like it doesn't feel right.
And it doesn't really suck.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care of the fact that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a We-Vibe vibrator.
He has completely broken down the taboo that may persist in some men, namely, that they see competition in erotic aids.
"Various options are being made," he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer to men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but “more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience.
In Japan it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought that Japanese women were very fond of erotic aids, I object.
“That’s the reality of the internet,” he explained.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic devices are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboo for women." Just for the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not very prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Unlike other countries, such as Italy or Poland.
A typical shopper is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience with both sex life and some aids.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of each product to make sure that it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into specials such as bondage and latex, because we do not have the space for it, and it is not suitable here.
Things like this might discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always had the shame of going to a sex shop because they were afraid something like that would come up.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of renowned brands.
Some have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was given to the seahorse "and this triggered a change in the industry as a whole.
They began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with health-conscious ones, began to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that behind the design of some is a Czech, namely popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised how many people buy those designer things from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Anna Marešová’s Venus Balls.
She did a really huge job by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to be in control of the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since this is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than large series.
I may be going against the tide, but I think it is important to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are embarrassed.
Anna Marešová is currently offering a vibrator for which you can make a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and other news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin won’t sell?
It's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one, to another may seem completely abnormal, so we rather define ourselves by the assortment of brand manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail arrived in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we do not have such a thing.
“I’m not kidding,” Martin said with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is struggling with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's true, unfortunately," the singer confirmed the sad information of Lightning himself.
I know about my illness and I am still able to manage it, given the circumstances.
"I'm taking medication to slow down the disease," he said, adding that he would thank those close to him for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make life easier for Karl.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, her daughter from her first marriage, Zuzana and Tereza, takes care of her father Karel called Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has had 60 chemotherapy treatments.
He was able to return to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I am told by the astrologer that I will be here until ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
“I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don’t forget them,” Karel admitted.
Actress Květa Fialová is currently battling the same disease.
Do you have an Alzheimer’s patient in your family?
See how to treat him.
Chile’s parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the bill will review.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out even for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said in a statement.
Chile's Constitutional Court has 10 members and is expected to receive a new president at the end of August, which is close to opposition, according to AFP.
The bill lifting the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the right of the unborn child to life.
MPs postponed voting on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the bill, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if a woman’s life is threatened, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
The Spanish newspaper El País reported that there had been similar exceptions in Chile since 1931, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, some 20 women are currently behind bars, serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting a pregnancy.
In many cases, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump’s White House now targets Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what was coming when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitations of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque was placed on the pedestal with the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, not until 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta, saying: "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not a part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he said himself, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let it come to me, who is dwindling, who is poor, who can hardly breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not seek to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classical theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Combining the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Renowned commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Strangely enough, Limbaugh comes up with an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned traveler who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to kindle hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Athletics Championships: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the United Kingdom Athletics Federation, said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge asset for the team".
For the 2017 World Championships in London, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that “something special is happening in Scotland” and that British athletics could learn little from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we'll work on that," Black said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they have done.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or non-Scottish, came out of the room with a sense of pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Cup, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
At the World Championships, he will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m run.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The team captain said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had joined the team, but in many cases they would also attack the participation in the final and the medal.
“The extraordinary thing about being a team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is very gratifying,” she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scots who made it to the team.
It shows where we've gone.
It is the athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I was just pointing out that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I will enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
This criticism did not leave him cold.
He did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on his way to acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and many "who cares" views appeared in comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not an outrage.
As you can see, he runs his state with confidence and strictly adheres to the principles.
He has also been shown to be adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents, with the exception of publishing the first photo with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum marked as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments took place from a post moderation position.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people to whom the posts had been deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's attorney Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “concentrated spam interest” would likely be called “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, where she barred one of her constituents from accessing her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have been accumulating in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very heart of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept that.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is according to O2’s latest statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
Therefore, it is no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum number of people go during the winter, data consumption has increased even fiftyfold this summer.
Italy came second in the data consumption ranking.
Most minutes Czechs call from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs per year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
People here, however, exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
"Tens of millions of photos could fit into the transferred data," Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2, said in a statement.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Moreover, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic through Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data following the release of roaming charges, growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled since last year.
Germany dominates here with a huge advantage over other countries.
“Roaming calls are more likely to be used by business customers on business trips,” Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the East Lothian area of Scotland, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open, over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final. This year, he will serve as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an avid defender of the game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in good hands.”
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“I have a good feeling about it,” said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when Sharon and I were very lucky to win.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th birthday this year, returns home.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play on home soil,” Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I am happy with the result so far.”
The three players will also be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance to the tournament is free of charge. Parking fee is 5 euros for a car with one passenger and 10 euros for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with his hands unwashed.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol, and there are soldiers in the village.
“After five o’clock in the afternoon, no one is allowed to wander around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in a public handshake before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and ravaged city, which can be reached after a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach cramping ride.
Mass transit does not work at this location.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have looked at this place, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing this dress,” Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark t-shirt, and bright skirt.
“We used to only carry leaves.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
It is also the country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of American Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of logging.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including an amount of $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The mass murders in the Papuan tribal area during the 1970s were tantamount to genocide, the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province’s 3.5 million people, 83% are Christian, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
“Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"The indigenous people of Papua - mom-mom (women) - have lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he will hear our call for justice," You said.
In fact, just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai was shocked.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the twilight of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and tone, and later returned with four other soldiers, local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, citing victims and witnesses of the events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which a circle is run and the singing of birds is imitated - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered via radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” the official document said, the content of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of Enarotali district Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one paid any attention to his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes told TIME in a sullen voice, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “ensuring” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injury.
The news of the killings swept through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding for the victims' families and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be made.
“Most of the violent acts took place a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are committed to punishing these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in an interview on June 5 for the TIME weekly held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than 1,000 deaths during the independent 1999 elections in East Timor, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven’t seen anything yet,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, he still lives in fear a few years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me,” he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The skirmish, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the members and the response was a warning shot.
However, locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaries police) began shooting into the crowd, killing one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” said Domingga Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the participating police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal peoples who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Liberation Movement of Papua (OPM) - an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has in recent years arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the guise of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
The fire is fueled by poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began flowing into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp, were expelled from the papaya for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the pens of foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesians in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir slammed the allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people called out, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom".
Another election is scheduled for 2019, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robber army - are wallowing in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be a "debt" that must be repaid to Jokowi.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he said.
Despite threats and intimidation from the family of the victims of the Pan-Ai shooting, they continue their last symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
“What can we do?”
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
The four-man crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, were arrested during the raid.
The yacht, named Afalina, set sail from South America, and after being detained, police towed it to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it will work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going and to expose the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said Col Blanch, executive director of the agency.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Because of high street drug prices, Australia is an attractive destination for their smugglers.
The country is also facing the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, attempting to smuggle them across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, infusions of saline, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin, could be a solution.
However, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and get dehydrated very quickly," said Madlová.
You should definitely drink two liters.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, it is often not supervised by a doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated with infusions.
"I think it should be introduced gradually so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking in confusion," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, a maximum of a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin air out," she said.
This is the second time The Torch has burned in Dubai.
One of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers caught fire in Dubai on Friday, with firefighters having to evacuate all residents 337 meters tall and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the convenient name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and the alarm woke us up. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Geroge, one of the occupants of the skyscraper.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4am (00:00 GMT) before continuing to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide replacement accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could spark a renewed debate over the safety of the materials used to line high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by Torch after the fire in 2015 showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey found that more than one in five U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board a plane.
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on board the plane. At least six percent of passengers boarded the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they have been delayed in finding out they have traveled with a firearm, ammunition, or explosive device.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1,000 respondents responded - showed that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to consciously travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours, compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of the TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents knowingly passed a sharp object over security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport checkpoints and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and in what amounts they can carry into the plane.
Unsurprisingly, the TSA confiscated most of the banned liquid.
For some time, people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Transportation of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on Postponing Planned Directives to Reduce Obama Administration Emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its head Scott Pruitt rescinded his earlier decision to delay implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, making it more responsive than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This includes the latest deadline, set for October 1, for countries to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or threatened economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s state attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
Wednesday's sudden turnaround is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
“Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans,” Pruitt said, filing more than a dozen lawsuits with the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA's statement states that Pruitt may at some point use "the possibility of a delay and any other legally available authority" to ensure that regulations "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
The White House budget passed last month seeks to defer implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure still did not pass the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group would not allow legal pressure.
“The turnaround in the EPA’s views - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
“It’s worrying what pressure needs to be put to change the minds of those responsible and to protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to struggle with the Trump administration’s ideological drive to help polluters and special interests.”
He spilled acid on the man, yet he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the next minute your whole life changes from the ground up.
And worst of all, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was glued with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
This was reported by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christopheros'.
Andreas said he was going to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, immediately spilled acid on him without warning, saying, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I only felt an incredible pain in my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was hit, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most torturous thing I've ever experienced.
“You can’t hide from the unexpected light, you can’t close your eyes,” he said.
Today, Christopheros has completed twelve operations, which are far from the last.
Injuries sustained by victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and they fight deformation and disfigurement all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict changed dramatically to the amazement of the Christopheros family.
"The three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of corrosive attacks has increased significantly.
The Interior Ministry said it plans to set new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of such attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose more severe and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores as they are different cleaning products.
In Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, the famous The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to some residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
The alarm went off, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant George described the events.
Another witness on CNN estimated that about 40 apartments were engulfed by the flames.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building fell on them.
About two hours later, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there was a power outage in the surrounding buildings.
The massive fire also damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was harmed, as the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world at 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the 23-year-old Ippolito had a diverse collection of illicit drugs, from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year standoff and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record for caught athletes.
The third player, according to his words, began taking steroids a year before, when he succumbed to bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-lover!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also grabs attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into the arms of her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
They were separated, but remained friends to this day.
This was also demonstrated at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both turned blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal’s pranks until she fell by her stomach.
Then they hugged each other and posed willingly for the photographers.
But their meeting was no coincidence, as they will play a couple in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in prison in the UK for plotting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell known as the Three Musketeers to life in prison for plotting a terrorist attack against police and the military, prosecutors said.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar crimes, were arrested last August.
Authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "infidels", and a mock-up pistol.
This happened when an MI5 agent placed a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown just how terrible the defendants could have been if they had not been stopped," said Sue Hemming, the prosecutor's attorney.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth defendant, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodonín.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
At 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it surpassed Thursday, which thus became the warmest day this year so far.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice on Břeclavských Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice on Brnoských current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records were set in 2013.
It was 10 degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures occurred on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to rise there only now later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China has a lack of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion annually to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
The state media are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, according to an article by Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at the University of Beijing.
An example that speaks for itself is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, while the rest have to get their visas in advance.
Therefore, in the Chinese authorities in the US, crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait in line for hours, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, just two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and less than one percent of the total population.
China often exacerbates the problem by using tourism to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a spat around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visitors fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central bank, China may have left as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will raise about $35 billion a year to sell the currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists are inflicting a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously obstructing the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general reticence towards foreigners.
In many places in China, almost no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners in China.
There are many more in the United States as well.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to boost economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But you won’t find them in China.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, they have multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the offspring of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It is also growing meters in length," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
In the meantime, the young of the other two species, the Death Eaters and the Red Cobra, will be gaining strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian death vipers were born, descended from a breeding couple native to the Sydney area.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exposition belongs to the perthians," said Vobruba, adding that in human care wintering is required for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a pack of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched a total of four young from four eggs.
"The incubation took 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species sprays poison on its prey in nature, up to a distance of four meters.
Aims at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse holas in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect hatching chicks from a mamba black, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with leaders from Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peca Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
Trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border and said Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked a transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. deal on surveillance of refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came out under President Obama's administration - he would look "resourced" after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most uncomfortable call of the day.”
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor's office over Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," said Jaroslaw Kaczyński, the brother of the dead president, the head of PiS.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk said, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse the justice system against political rivals.
On leaving the prosecutor’s office, a crowd of people was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that the judiciary should serve as a tool for the current Polish rulers against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
It was the second time he had been interrogated.
The former prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor’s office for the second time, this time about the misconduct in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a confusion of bodies in the coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
“Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was supposed to serve to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU,” Kaczyński told Catholic television station Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk’s chances of winning the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
He did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summonses were seen as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by associating him with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
Since the last parliamentary elections in 2013, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies in these and several other countries.
This follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update and is currently in the process of commenting.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explains.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the document says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the version for the press.
It is their list that is being changed by the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also withdrew its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
There will also be no election at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital Dakar, and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Iraq’s Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan province.
Voting tickets for registered voters will also be available at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state election commission shall determine by lot the region for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when a decision was made among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, just like this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
Four years ago, there were 10,571 voters at the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Commemorate Racist Lying
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed by an onlooker in Monroe, Georgia and scrambled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked the way for him.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled out a long cigarette and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" shouted the man.
“Bring it to me!”
Silence is interrupted by the scream of a young black man being pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose through "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for murder yet.
“It’s a wonder that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand a prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated.”
On July 27, 1946, a medical examiner covers one of the bodies of lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to attend the lynching.
No one has been prosecuted yet.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates say that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court granted the citizens of Georgia the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
According to the FBI, it was during the summer elections that a black farmer named Roger Malcolm allegedly stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester over his wife.
According to Brooks, it was rumored in town that Hester had been having sex with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and had brought her into a different state.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white-skinned landowner, made a $600 bail against Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks was brief on the matter.
“It was a massacre for the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: ‘this is how you’ll turn out if you sign up and vote.’
The annual Moore's Ford Bridge reenactment has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is graphic, engaging, and concise, showing deep-seated racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden inside each of us,” Greene said.
“There can be no relationship between us if you don’t hear what I’ve been through.”
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - flocked to the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years, the leader of the Kukluxklan played, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
“I have a bad feeling about this because it goes against who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, respectively Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish - Malcolm argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n--e!"
Rascona can't be done.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
“What happened?” asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I being too rude?
“No,” Greene replied cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n--r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
They all want the performance to be authentic, just to make it worth the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronouncing of the word on N.
Now no one's laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
With every word there is sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, many bystanders from nearby.
Each endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks is in a crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murders could be viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is spooky.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel at the heads of the victims, watch the fake blood and immobile bodies, and whisper something into their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy muttered.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two fellow actors and weeps in their arms; eventually he is overwhelmed by emotions.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“I know you hate that role.
But you had a reason for it.”
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find words to express her feelings about today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous acts... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,” she added, adding, “it’s just called police skirmishes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying her dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience, but it is also a moment to reflect,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything was a rather rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one paper with hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some components, all with some secret markings.
When something broke inside me years later, I offered the document to the shaman, who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk, he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid to chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
A new era has brought new guidance.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply stuck to a sliced grapefruit, required about ten images.
A sketch was particularly good with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-part and no other procedure was possible.
Giving it the opposite required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking off certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the manuals ended with my self-propelled SEAT Leon.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among others, the replacement of a blinker bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right could only be replaced in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw in a new one.
3.Put the cover on.
The light bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
Initially, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the body of the car, I would find a spring, a screw with which the cover could be easily removed, and then I would follow the points of 1-3 of the energy-saving author of the service book.
Footbridge error.
The cover had no place, no room, not even for a slim Cinderella hand, let alone an obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life without success.
The situation was further aggravated by my wife’s entry into the garage, which was summoned by a roar and words that she heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?"
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I omit vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking so long?" she risked with a sentence that may be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, placing the main emphasis on the torture procedure of the author of the manual, where the ironing with hot iron on the hand that wrote the manual, and then its removal, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of instructions of the Hammer on the Witches, including his commissionual burning on the top above Losiny Castle.
"How about removing the box?" the woman said, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, this occurred, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collapsing state after checking two officials of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories in an unexcited voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having my handwashing instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I extracted from it the whole problem, which lay in the fact that over the sink in the patients' toilet there is no pictorial instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument to the commissioners that adults usually wash their hands and that it does not take pictograms to handle the usual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
“It’s not just that,” she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of soapy palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of a Cro-Magnon, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to let the water out of the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a joyful discovery that a person washed his hands exactly as the hosudar from SUKL orders him to do.
Finally, I have to say that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there is no problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an exact drawing of all anatomical details, which could cause a certain outrage to the prudish visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has wiped the appropriate hole with a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off another 3,000 employees and cut dividends in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon said would occur at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost reduction program in an effort to resurrect declining business due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in base sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh city district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement further stated that all wounded soldiers are out of danger to life and are located in a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
The growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should be helping military units and police officers in the country.
Reporters say the suicide attacks, which have shaken public confidence in the government in recent weeks, have shaken the school's public confidence in the government and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghanin's reputation.
EPA reconsiders decision to delay smoking rules in response to lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration’s law that mandated states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to cede “Ozone Standards 2015,” saying it was putting forward the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that EPA negotiations were illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to circumvent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, in an effort to boost economic growth, Trump said.
However, the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this relatively new singer in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event for Czech conditions, where he hosted such prominent personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was hosted by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and present their music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was attended by the just-named personalities.
However, few people already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shooting with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it was not without a lot of embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer’s jukebox was supposed to indicate a slap in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I did not expect it, I immediately let blood out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers talked about the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe as to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
Now we bring you the video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with a punch.
However, an unsuccessful version with blood was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, the two boxers who could stage the most thrilling light-weight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each was in a separate room at ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council - walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's match at Showtime, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer duel would be a "perfect test".
“I’m a former featherweight champion,” Garcia adds.
“I had to put on weight because of the match with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small for my 63 kilos.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not give it to them.”
Lomachenko agrees.
Boxing would be good for this game.”
Klimas has made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the title in light weight in a forum.
"The match should be a pay-per-view style, that's what fans are asking for," Garcia said, who later said he was open to airing the match on the TV station that would come up with the best deal.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could attend his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, did not let Garcia's praise lull him when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow...sorry Mike, but you're calling yourself a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers stated that they felt increasing tension before the duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game gets so much attention.
And I'm very happy to put it on the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match.”
A young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
There was a huge search for them, but without success.
Finally, the police stopped the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story came to a sad end.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, Chuvash.
It was only thanks to the documents left in the car that the police managed to identify a few.
The documents survived for a decade underwater, without them it would have taken the police much longer to find out the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of the young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of people were surveyed as over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency began testing the drug earlier this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged that the respondent was "perhaps over 18 years of age".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under 18".
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the respondent is disputed.
According to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases, “the person interviewed was 18 years of age or older.”
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the respondent said he would be 18 years old this year.
There has also been criticism of the medical method of age determination, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and x-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, is concerned with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
In a sense, the assessment of biological age is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," he told Metro newspaper.
The forensic medical agency, Agency's Goransson, defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is just under 18 years old, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that the funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has also spoken openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to a transcript of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump rebuked Pena Nieto undiplomaticly for criticizing his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
The funding will somehow come up and eventually it will work out well.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to see you guys anymore because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took power.
Mexico has refused to build and finance the 3,200-kilometer-long wall, and relations between the two countries have been strained.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project will be paid for by the United States.
Trump met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States admitting people from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not a deal you made, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escalated.
“I hate receiving these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They won't be great people going to work for local dairy farmers," he said.
In an interview, he said a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
At the end of January, roughly a week after arriving at the White House, Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in a single day.
Turnbull ended up being the least pleasant call of the day.
He said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching too.
The execution took place on the square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Magrabi chose Rana Almatari, a little girl who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He also raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim’s father told the media his feelings.
I feel like I've been reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the slogan "let justice live".
The attacker was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was dragged out.
The police put him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I was standing in Sana'a Liberation Square waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful frenzy, grabbing the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by the court, which is under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions caused such outrage that the judge decided to use the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
As police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the wounds that were carried by Ran's body were terrible," he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a gruesome act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
Yemenis were disgusted by the crime and began gathering outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused did not appear to show remorse for his act.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the sentence, but the condemned man only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings made by the crowd on the Internet.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
West Virginia's Democratic governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's rally that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me,” Justice said.
“Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce to you... Today, as a resident of West Virginia, I say to you that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor.”
A crowd of onlookers burst into joy.
“Tomorrow I will join the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you that it’s time to go to another game.”
Trump has previously promised important announcements to the people at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, “The run-over of the Governor of Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to uplift our country.”
“For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last straw for an already woeful leaderless party that is vainly seeking to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sports was right and that he is committed to fighting doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia was encouraging doping of its athletes.
“I think we saw a very honest response and presentation today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All the members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working with all its might to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been a very successful day and we have advanced to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“We have to do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the coming months.
“Our goal has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones,” he said.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag, having met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being allowed back in.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to run their business, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to František Savov, whose state is prosecuting him.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the Czech state prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The order, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta by entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was reported by news server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion helped Savov’s company significantly.
According to information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
As a result, it moved it ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with the amount of CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the judges in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the server Aktuálně.cz, falls under the publishing house Economia.
VLM filed several objections to the tender result, claiming that its evaluation was unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant of Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the proposer and other suppliers," reads the proposal to initiate the procedure submitted to the Office of the Public Procurement Office this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an unreliable and 100% assessment of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as improbable and suspicious," he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade agency does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on the course of the contract," Štěpán Dlouhý, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in that article.
In the tender she could be helped by the fact that she provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first tendered in 2013 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state the alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the United Kingdom for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, a London court rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the United Kingdom regarding the acquisition of the legal force of the judgment," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Public Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá fronta, Savov worked for Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company that controlled the České Budějovice-based Samson brewery, and for Maraflex, a Cyprus-based investment fund that buys endangered assets.
He will also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist rode along the sidewalks and through the park, ended up in a pile of rocks.
The motorcyclist attracted attention by reckless driving on streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to run away in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers followed the man with extreme caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Police later found out that the biker did not have a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle had been stolen, his serial number had been cut and the production label itself had been removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The breath test was performed to rule out the presence of alcohol at the driver's place, but the test showed a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How Football’s Financial Rules Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain in France will not be affected by the rules restricting funding for European football clubs.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial terms of Neymar's move to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has grown rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on buying players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his appointment as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, FFP rules shifted its focus from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend exorbitant sums for players y build a global brand - suddenly wasn't as profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount of Neymar’s redemption in a lump sum, it may spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million every year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG was fined 60 million euros ($82 million) - which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar's income in PSG could be paid by the 2022 FIFA World Cup organizing committee in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the 2022 World Cup officials in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become the World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to insiders, UEFA has not launched any investigation into Neymar’s transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous, as he was not allowed to comment on the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
The Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to frustrate Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told Spain's AS newspaper, referring to the club's ownership of PSG by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the same La Liga stance on club funding.
“It’s the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world in the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“Once you become a club owner, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the set.
The same scene as in the Sunday game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
Letenský team pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements thus ends after the opening double-match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything after the match in Belgrade?
We had to score four goals, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to raise our self-confidence so that we would have something to bounce back from to the next matches.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is terribly busy.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we only shot once in half time.
Of course, that’s very little if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the opponent into such positions more often.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the assembly?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three matches and the line-up is constantly changing.
The idea is for the coach to find the perfect 11 to sit down.
Are you excited to have played two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
“I don’t know how I’m going to develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It’s the same with injuries.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
It was a wonderful visit, as it was with Boheme.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something that they'll come back for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a considerable extent.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court’s database.
It is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, consider factual or legal errors allegedly committed by ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where he was, according to the resolution, also at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was incurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage exceeded a billion, according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, it paid taxes in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company has been doing business are related to the entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, who was sentenced by the judiciary to 13 years in prison for machinating with VAT in fuel stores.
His complaint was rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series “Summer to Survive” and “Comrade Detective” play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s; for the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd fled to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the French point of view, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to absurd humor (an example can be the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables, which was narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not push so much on the emotional plane, and satire is sometimes even sporadic, including parodies of thrillers from the 1990s as "Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds on a pile of junk Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being fomented by George H. W. Bush (a very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
Especially fun is watching the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character Matt Dillon from Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as the return of the Seven Up series, until it achieves what I suspect will be the logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” in which the whole group will embark on the premiere of “Summer to Survive.”
Meanwhile, “Comrade Detective” on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War revival of the series “Such Normal Americans”, the film “Atomic Blonde: No Regrets” and even the series “GLOW”, in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes clash.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism following the Marxist-Leninist style.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, voiced in the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (like the police watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors have voiced the series, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloé Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective focuses too much on a clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan-masked assassin - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long and comedic moments are not enough.
For a shorter run, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in the lobby of which two fat men devour burgers stacked in a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
Russian athletes have not yet been banned from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) confirmed at a congress in London the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to the state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the World Cup, which will start on Friday, is expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted in favor of the ban, with only 21 against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF special investigation group Rune Andersen stated before Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have yet to be heard, and there are still reputation-damaged coaches working in the country.
Russia’s anti-doping agency, Russia’s anti-doping agency, does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though there has been progress, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015 after Russian athletes lost the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Cup, 19 Russians have already demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to compete in the national colours and will not play the Russian national anthem if they win.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
As expected, the Bank of England should announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by bland economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has dampened speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “in the background” of maintaining interest rates despite the squeeze on family budgets.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has voted six-to-two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years due to inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents on capital should increase more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Financing Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has said that it will now offer 15 billion less than the planned 115 billion euros.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and consumption burdens.”
On the issue of rates, the bank said it would need to “tighten the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a higher degree” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled to 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases, the bank said, adding that the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise “significantly” towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the strong interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will compensate for the lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that a complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many had called for an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households, and three policymakers had called for a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and inflation should rise again next month.
The bank said the overshooting relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are out of existing contracts and re-mortgage - there are no fees on offer, as well as the low rates they enjoy."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention from September following a Supreme Court decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund a probationary period after an appeals court backed a Supreme Court decision last year saying the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
PrEP application before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transsexuals, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential test participation.
The scheme comes to taxpayers at 10 million euros and NHS England has signed a contract this week to distribute medicines following the award of an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully burden the ever-expanding and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must make it available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
“It is now important that we start testing across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.”
High-rise life: mezzanine and smart design turn this small apartment at Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is an illustrative example of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
“Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I nodded at him the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed's design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high that there were two gaps above it - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the magnificent living room old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
“The door is fitted with counterweights to make it very easy to pull off.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is living space - or an appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
“A real estate agent basically calculates the price of the apartment based on the living area when entering the apartment.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You won’t love the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won’t win your heart.”
As it turned out, quality design and increase of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally choose to stay.
The United States is splitting up.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
California has banned the use of state funds to travel to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT people and considers any manifestation of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
Tennessee has passed a conscientious objection law that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that prohibit religious charities from providing same-sex adoptions to parents who have given birth to children.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens' travel to eight states by the Union from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have their trips to scientific symposiums reimbursed by their universities in Texas, for example, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must either obtain federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens' trips from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it does not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's imposing them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
He also called on the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
Here are the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on conscientious objection, as well as to decide what their money will be used for and what it may not be used for.
Secondly, what is wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he only offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty of punishment when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
She also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing ones.
Why punish him and not leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their domestic policy in terms of non-federal powers, i.e., according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
They say no one should ever show a moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know of a situation in American history in which states deliberately did this for political reasons, except in one case.
Even in the era of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1850s, the political cause was slavery, and the war of the North against the South was imminent.
Of course, this will not happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening, and the U.S. is mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin has been fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for calling people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The penalty is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
Russia’s electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption fighter, considers the verdict to be politically motivated.
The court also fined two members of Navalny’s pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin, on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from campaigning in any way possible.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
The verdict was upheld by the appeals court in May.
The sentence is so final that Navalny is prevented from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million.
Now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, the two brothers are competing for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who has caught up in a dispute over community property and business assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but a heated dispute is constantly being denied by the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the family founded Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money has bought more properties and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who is described as the "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court filings state that Colin owns $316 million of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million of real estate.
For Paul, it was the distribution of assets and funds that became problematic.
“Colin’s proposal came in my eyes in markedly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a 2015 affidavit to the court.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to him, Colin has cut off.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and advocates from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by the estate, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family-owned business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped the transfer of the property to the sons would go well.
“Luigi used to say he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies. Colin stated that Mark was compensated with $10 million on his departure and Luke with $26 million.
Paul said both Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation".
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former AFL club board member, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only responded by text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, "I have nothing to add."
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court,” he wrote.
In a statement in court in mid-2016, Colin said he was trying to accommodate his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he was “still hoping for a successful solution.”
On Friday, there was no hope.
“Our disputes will be resolved by court hearings soon,” Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
The teachers showered the kids.
Public transport drivers use water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in classrooms where the blinds are pulled down and the curtains are drawn.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have open operation," said the kindergarten director Miloslava Makovickova.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery, where the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close and we have blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the property, so we are under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there is a table under it, and we do various things there," the kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová described.
The teachers try to go with the children to the forest, where there is a greater coolness.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Jitka Vilimovska, the head of the kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague’s Prosek district, also said that teachers try to keep their children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees there," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child must have a head covering.
The teachers also remind the children to drink.
They can choose, for example, little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have a watering can in the garden.
Every day they also eat vegetable salad and snack always fresh fruits and vegetables, which are sometimes brought to them by parents.
"Maybe today a mother brought here about ten kilos of melon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
In most cases, the cabs of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged so far.
Minor damage occurred in the loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roadways," Řehková said.
In the carriageways and in some alternating places, employees have available so-called soda bars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic destroyed 108 of them, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed fighting with fire.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail, as well as those associated with harvest work," said fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening weather change did not bring relief to the firefighters, when storms and torrential precipitation replaced the heat in many places.
Firefighters responded to 236 incidents.
It was mainly the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They were the most involved in the Central Bohemian region," Zaoralová continues.
However, help from firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky in the Českolipsko region, where 60 people were evacuated to safety from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added to the work of Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances drove out to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the kara.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released when combustion is not perfect.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to cut the president's media diet
Many have tried before and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do that.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information from President Trump, including news coverage, in the hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of a report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem for Trump’s White House that he intends to correct: incorrect information that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or verbal - because the president could make better decisions based on the right information."
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have brushed their teeth at Trump’s scrutiny and media presentation.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reports, it was fitting to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media that were easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets at bay - at least in the words of six former campaign organizers - is to make sure Trump regularly watches the media who praise him.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t - that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn’t check them.
The tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least several times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from raising controversial issues on a regular basis.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by slipping Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angry to negative media reports, especially leaks, and seeks to trace their origins.
The situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of many leaks" from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was banished from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had previously published false allegations and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsivity doesn’t just fade away and his aides are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors will surely make Kelly's mission harder.
Tourists negotiate ditch and return to 'Millionaires Quarter'
Several of the most wealthy homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again wrangling with determined tourists as they negotiate with local authorities for the right to reclaim the field behind their mansions.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in the town of Solihull, nicknamed the 'millionaires' quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after they were banished in May. They did not even fear the ditch, which was dug on the spot on the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
The tactful group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served as a route.
The angry residents of the district attacked Solihull's city council, saying they were "not able to solve the problem".
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
There were others last night, and there will probably be more today.'
She added: "The Birmingham Board of Trustees knows how to deal with this problem and uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board of directors has dealt with the tourists."
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last tourists leave and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A spokesman for Solihull City Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the problem in cooperation with local police.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police at number 101.
This will give us an overall picture of what we are going to do in court.”
Her husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special brought the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After the transfer to the homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is married to Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians confirm fight against NGO rescue ships with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea if the NGOs do not sign new rules regulating their operations.
“If the NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they can continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning comes a day after Italian authorities seized the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet’s boat on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization declined to comment on the case because of allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all current allegations after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation.”
Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants on board, who were handed over to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the prosecutor's file, at least one meeting took place just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta’s MOAS and Spain’s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any “substantial change or obstacle” to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by the organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is a Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in recent weeks in migrants disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In the last days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Unashamed Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to wear only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
For the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and all that have to do with TV Prima, just swarmed, she wrapped her body in a mini overall.
And just a few ordinary movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
He had cut her in half so many times, and she was so tall that she had to adjust it all the time.
There was no need for the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Sending Text Messages Inducing Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of inadvertently killing Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at liberty until the decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood in place of the verdict with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped and her eyes pointed to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take responsibility for herself,” she said.
“She showed no remorse.”
But Carter’s attorney said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on her actions.”
The plaintiff read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy: “There is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of a person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in place that would penalize a person assisting the suicide of another person, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found poisoned by carbon dioxide in a car seat in 2014.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published inciting suicide.
“Hang yourself, jump out of a building or stab yourself, I don’t care,” Carter said in a text message sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him: “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter craved attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Ms. Knox, 30, told the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just one day before the Audi announcement, the automaker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are more smart options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is BMW's headquarters - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to a large extent to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulation.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in costs for automakers to install devices to neutralize gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German car makers face careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing allegations of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emissions limits - spreading the accusations that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have an adverse impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmakers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident took place at Praia de Sao Joao beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people are said to have fled to the sea from the beach.
Unfortunately, two people managed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane knocked them down and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both of whom escaped the accident alive and were taken away for questioning by police.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built already in 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the Hradec highway D11.
The construction of another section of it was stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We East Bohemians get the highway by bits, like when salami is cut.
We'll take the wheel and see when we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměr or Náchod, which is not a sensible way to get around.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and the other sections to Jaroměr started with the archaeological survey, with the construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear a loud bang of plugs in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children's Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has given way to decay.
Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hradec Králové City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we are leaving the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of Burial.
So we go down, we just go on the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to subsequently join the column.
The worst thing is that you can see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the children of the earth want?
What are the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually unfinished in the current system?
Read on for a new reflection.
Lavender from Provence is a threat to climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the region of southeastern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to dry climates and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates are also to blame."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil that is produced from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoc staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, the onslaught of recent events gathers mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two distinguished journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children to an office that was bombed in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
To choose from - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are on the rise among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pen Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, though his presence is pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which he shows a middle finger, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, making it extremely rare for journalist killers to go to court.
Journalists from Riodoc insist on reporting on the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the area is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
“It’s foolish to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, no one can be trusted.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoc headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as The Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions seek to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of jeweled two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoc still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The peace might have angered the sons; the suspected gang members bought all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
He was practically a veteran of Noroeste when he decided to sell his $50 stock in 2003 and set up a joint venture with five fellow Riodocs.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspaper began to thrive.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was afraid for my life,” he said when accepting the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “way of life,” Valdez told Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do in the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
The staff of Riodoc misses Valdez. The man was known for his wits and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you get involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas.”
“These things were banned,” Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is wrong, keep your hands off me.
The trouble is, Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal said, “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the Riodoc meeting room, as spyware was discovered a few days ago that was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from a 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the Riodoce offices, located in a four-story building in the burgher district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of the fact that these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law-enforcement officials who the government says are corrupt.
It’s been months since journalists last ventured into the mountainous areas that basically control the drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also charged with suspicious government expenditures that took place in the governor’s hometown.
Recently, there have also been several abductions at one of Culiacán’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block away from the state’s attorney’s office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary when they were about to write about what every city dweller knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped an army task force.
Until a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez’s column, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
“Valdez would definitely crack the case,” said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed “El Flaco” for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set off to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office the following morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body has been discovered, authorities say, based on DNA analysis, it's Adamea.
The activity of journalists is escalating all over the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper, Bojorquez, is on a day trip to Washington to seek international support and justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for proclaiming the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department out of fear that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “besieged” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and the indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 media watchdog group has accused more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you,” Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the decapitated head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down operations, such as the newspaper El Norte based near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslava Breach.
The others still go on, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels in public with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being hunted down and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's midnight on Friday, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest issue being sent to a printer - sipping a beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They are told that 19 people were killed in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as promised by many messages left in the area by members of the syndicate.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the title changes again.
The sound of police sirens points to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glance at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they are afraid, they don’t show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for all Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow his footsteps.
“How could we possibly think of leaving,” said Bojorquez, “when, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out into the streets?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have dubbed the 'Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs' - have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin, stating that the dinosaur had a "problem past".
An article in Current Biology called it “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved state literally shocked researchers, who described it with the words ‘really remarkable’.
According to National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completing the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“You just have to close your eyes a little and you’ll believe they’re asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved species of dinosaur, the Mona Lisa.
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many animals today.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system indicates that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who and his team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They revealed a method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising, as Borealopelta’s size far exceeds that of today’s animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was such a large number of predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many modern camouflaged animals - such as deer, zebra, or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survival.
“The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had a reddish-brown coloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more knowledge about its life, including the preserved contents of its stomach, to trace its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after its death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta area, the climate was the same at the time as in present-day Florida, and rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to close your eyes a little and it seems like he’s just sleeping.”
During the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the snout to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm thorns protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to such an extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “The finding of such an individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to such an extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and browsed through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
A St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying limp on the street, from where no one took him even after four hours.
“That’s crazy,” thought Ferrell.
Death was nothing new to her and her family.
She hung up the phone to return to him the evening she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign in his hand that read "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog on the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, was holding a gun pointing at the crowd and shouting, “I’m going to kill you all... the animals.”
“That’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
“I was angry and I cried.”
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the point of view of people living in a community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with blacks".
“Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?”
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“There was no way I wasn’t going to take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination... of the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also needed to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism, she is in no way different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop of the road was South Florissant Road opposite the police department, which became the base of activists awaiting the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped to distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly being born.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. Association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
Weeks later, Ferrell met later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story that could be used?”
This type of skepticism has infiltrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make a living out of pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview, "We've heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, who is an acclaimed local artist who deals with the theme of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the documentary's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community together," Folayan said - it turned out that she is the most open to participating in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, smiling at the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
“But I realized that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up.”
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created the #BlackLivesMatter campaign in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media - call themselves freaks.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women have to bear the brunt of these events."
Folayan agrees, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of kinky black women."
However, she insists that “this is not just an affirmative issue” and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
“She was the driving force and source of energy,” she said.
It is no coincidence that she was in the front lines, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television stations' cameras cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking a highway during demonstrations.
She described the social-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as “The Mess.”
Still, she hasn’t given up on her commitment since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene and a helicopter helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire ceased to spread around 3:15 p.m., firefighters declared a third level of fire alarm out of four possible.
Ladislav Holomčík, a spokesman for firefighters, said the helicopter also helped extinguish the fire from the air.
At 6:00 p.m., firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused 700,000 crowns worth of damage.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of the combine.
The fire was also helped by a helicopter, which made a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally publishing secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before his departure from the U.S. presidency.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the malleability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, said she considered herself a woman and was convicted of 20 counts in 2013, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
All her photos were kept by prison staff, and only one lower-quality black-and-white photo leaked to the public, with Manning, visibly concerned, sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum-blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible forms of these people.
It was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to add a portrait to the story," Dewey-Hagborg said at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, neither visiting nor photographing was allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic strip called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the show in person.
Indeed, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, a welcome change after several intolerable years in a Kansas military prison.
Interestingly, the show is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to fuel resentment with his tweets in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the artist’s statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is dotted with the heart) after the end of “self-acting factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side, there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to Dewey-Hagborg’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), she wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope people will take it from this, that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in King Kong fashion from a United States Discipline Barracks prison with a megaphone in her hand.
“As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win,” it says.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
“In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees her.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide search is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court filing.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau has been pronounced dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has served as associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the University of the North West is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished he had reported to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in their search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the scene as violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria would be implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) re-established.
“Part of the new plan’s criteria has now been finalised and RUSADA has already been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, WADA's plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's compliance plan - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future."
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the government’s alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutko’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSAD of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was “on the right track” to renew.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting up a fire to a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in Frýdek-Místec.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole issue," Kužel said.
He said police would discuss the possibility of arresting the accused.
Further information cannot be disclosed by the Director.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation service and the prosecutor who oversees the case are really working on it," Kužel said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Gutech dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
This was caused by an electrical failure.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on the citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
Financial support for associations that can be used in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers counts on the substantive intention of the Act on the preparedness of citizens for the defense of the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the task by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This is due to the proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
Should the law be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the military.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of military duties and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the aid of the country in times of crisis, and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in their training or education.
It is also planned to organize discussions with veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of a state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the statement said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not only military ones.
"The basic objective of the project is to create a very broad base that will allow each citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or contribute to the protection of others, and by improper behavior not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to perform their tasks," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would be spent on salaries or on building an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, employing 42 additional soldiers.
The ministry said earlier that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a corresponding survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising anonymity for the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from outside.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer total employee anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints, and in some cases, also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools on the market like Diet and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she has gained greater awareness of what her employees think and feel over the past three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are starting to realize that it’s necessary to pay attention to the work environment culture - in case they become another Uber - that is reeling from scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convert, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent’s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken over.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the startup Convertent.
If a company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior - and regulators fail to intervene - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, staff exhaustion, or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or email to the company’s management, officially file a complaint, and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, according to which there had previously been no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convertent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never before reached office managers is ensured, miles away from real complaint resolution - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment.
“This comes close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees.”
Companies stopped taking employee ethics, values and participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after the collapse of Enron over the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media shined a spotlight” that companies began to realize that they couldn’t simply hide their skeletons in a closet in the online world.
“Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold capital investors, supported by both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised a total of $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy at their jobs, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors make money when a company thrives and a company thrives when its employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can occur.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case ever - it can cause disappointment and indifference among employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies rely too heavily on the data itself.
“Because when you don’t get things done, employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
If not, why should I care?”
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to solve the problem within a day with Glint, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important perspective on its employees and hopes to achieve high long-term employment in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“Once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region.
Tuesday was the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
There were not many temperature records on Thursday.
Vedra mainly affected Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of 145 weather stations spanning over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, today’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records were set in 2013.
Today, high temperatures have occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, today’s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to rise there only now later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had a lot of trouble here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote as every other adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as cheeky as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with his colleagues Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejšek’s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babiš was named by the mayor of Kromeriz, Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
The mayors have also been arrested recently.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But the mayor’s entrée didn’t work out very well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the ANO movement to win 20% of the Mayors movement in the elections.
He smiled.
Grandfather's speech is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he is going to compete for the votes of voters in the Mayors’ jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
My grandfather supported my grandmother in the last election.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not dominate with the flattering rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he is not going into politics because he wants to improve himself.
My grandmother is a hero.
He is willing to step out of his controlled world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the mayors to learn how to work with Babis.
Some may appreciate the fact that Grandpa does not change his views and stands by himself no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his B.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, has broken up with the head of Agrofert in a bad way in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
Grandfather’s first public appearances, however, were not only about Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to hear such a statement.
Indeed, the court-appointed crook Zdeněk Bakala threw millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the civic democrats have together reached nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
Once he got into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
You might wonder why politics has such a bad reputation.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with higher education in our country lose about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a basic at less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the conditions here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather’s vision of society, the poor pay their fair share of taxes, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state in which they do not participate much.
The rich need to be helped to avoid poverty.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš can rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not consider the members of their party or citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling property is sometimes not easy.
And often not even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump will help him.
When Le Chateau des Palmiers was sold, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the current prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million pounds.
The NCAA decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins come long days
It’s 11 a.m., and UCLA football players are squeezing at the sidelines of a new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing are substituted by a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held the following morning at 6:30 a.m.
“For these guys, the next three days are going to be tough,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday rolled over on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions are scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already crowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in six seasons as a coach at Westwood, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and training is limited during the summer semester, as well as the decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora has said he supports the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already-charged player's schedule.
"For three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They’re great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after the net was cleared behind the goalpost.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security guards, as well as parking no. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook is planning a more thorough fact-checking to reduce the number of fake news stories
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties and display findings under the original posts in an effort to combat so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties to verify and potentially display survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
There are political debates in Europe about the whole matter. French voters are flooded with fake news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September election if it does not quickly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement on Thursday that it plans to launch testing of a new fake news check feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to viewing third-party verified news, people are asking for more content so they can be better informed and make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook continues to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce fake news.
Making a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video for Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher found refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from his cozy spot on the River Bewl in Kent, UK, inspiring the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The sight of the writing of a man 300 years after death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages until the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,” he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
I love the archives!
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to stay in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been thrown down a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners and occasionally also artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
“Drinking whiskey and writing.”
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words as "aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands around with the words 'Put it in the attic'."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing the estates: “You may think the land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
“I found a record of a revolt in the castle from 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,” Rhodes said.
“The English rebellion actually started in this area and I thought that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they’re somehow related.”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years after the coffin was unearthed).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male generation - men of the time were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to confuse the heads of heiresses."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he soaked up inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed in nature.
This is a strange place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I was like, ‘Now let’s get the hell back to real life.’
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media published the words of President Donald Trump about the new US immigration plan, which will also include a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will reduce the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will favor English-speaking applicants who are affluent with funding and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Yeah.
Sex robots are very popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
“People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate wife, including shyness.
And then there’s the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including a “frigid Farrah” who is characterized by a shy nature and a “wild Wendy” with an “adventure” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” the company’s website says.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons, including not being mistaken for real human relationships, but rather having inferior female traits and violent innuendos, such as the frigid (read-defying) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have a Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual device.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robot woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringe of interest to the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't freaky or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women around the world are claiming their rights and a president is sitting in the White House who is often very derogatory about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hanging bodies and gouged eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but it seems to be a small step at the moment.
Sex robots should as much as possible resemble real women (even with the measures of a porn actress).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to the touch and look at first glance like a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality”, a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing to encourage their independence or break their allegiance to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.

NBA star on green tusk.
Curry fights for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost despite a botched first shot at the premier start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player award winner played the lower series of the Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, for 74 runs and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started nervously and ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by a fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a record of four shots over par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it kind of sat down," Curry said.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
"If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to make it through with a cut that is likely to be set two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of the stage fright, hopefully that will work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
At Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political schisms that divide American voters and, on a micro-scale, tear apart entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving periods, the U.S. newspapers were teeming with advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for him to let us in.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to bring families together.
I’m talking about this because this week I was visited by my cousin, a poet and leftist fan who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a long time in our family as a Republican fool.
She reminded me that being together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings they've been bickering about politics for years - is suddenly on the same page.
It’s a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but it amazes me that, in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his clowns may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both examples of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York City Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3 unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy view, and the clinky music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama takes a peek, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven’t gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub - but a London Underground station.
However, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carousel, it would earn maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience in the store this week when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I grudgingly rated my credit card transfer five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which he said had been self-inflicted after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet closet at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could face up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas bred in captivity.
An employee of Zhang Qing told New China that breeding pandas is at high risk due to inbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to mate captured pandas with wild pandas is the first step to helping protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cao Cao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every step.
She met her chosen one Cao Cao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males have a fairly poor estimate of when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonia police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are removing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said meant 80 percent of eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority noted that only a limited number of egg types are identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech SVS, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also closed their farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, whose markets are affected by insecticides.
Eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of flea, everything and tick products.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be moderately toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and he is looking for an engagement.
I would like to spend 10 more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said Sedláček, a 27-year-old who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as high school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started to catch.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I thought I’d be fishing all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end of the day, my friend was more interested.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their style of play against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the void.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have trouble traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually designed so that you can play four matches outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia follows hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody cheers.
Even if it didn’t work out, a lot of people did.
Did Dinamo’s performance in the KHL help Latvia almost make it to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada narrowly 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts made it to Zlín, and Ralfs Freibergs is ahead of signing the contract.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not B players, they're really good players.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still uninvolved?
At the beginning of February I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalie, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the end they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I got something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where I will sign.
How real is it that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We’ll see what happens in a month, what happens next.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn’t enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government's flight continues.
In January of this year, in the article With the Care of a Proper Farmer?, I wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlíku.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remind you of the key passages of the article.
We have been talking about summer camp for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best to look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní loz Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labor camp from August 8, 1940, from January 1, 1942 it was a collection camp, and from August 2, 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Lety prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp transported 370 people.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings caused by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is also no dispute that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built nearby and on parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but this has not yet happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So many facts about the fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the farm will then be bought by the government.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably frustrate those intentions if I went public with them."
We’ll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won’t be cheap.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp there is a monument, in the modifications of which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was financed beautifully by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Does the government have any other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of remembrance, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that took place, and anyone can bow down to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of honor with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, i.e. the taxpayers’ money, should be treated by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper manager.
At least as much as in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, well-maintained parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own reverent place, which is made of stones located on a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the exposed foundations could not be preserved and made accessible in an appropriate way at least visually.
The Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could put his efforts in this direction.
If he manages to enforce the purchase of the pig farm for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may reduce symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million US residents and 300,000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps build immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As soon as the scales tilt to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He also suggested that if the same turns out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of same mice kept separately lacked cells.
She deduced that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The gut of the mice was tested by DNA sorting, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it was shown to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase cell populations."
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United 'genius'
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in the form of Nemanjo Matic - at least José Mourinho thinks so after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a 40-million-pound contract, made his debut in the first match with a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić was out of shape and only played 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he’s experienced, he’s smart and he’s got a brilliant mindset, he’s thinking football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get in shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape their eleventh for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" bringing three of the top four players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would have been more pleased, but I admit they did the best they could for me.”

He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
Pear immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And because the two have been peaking for several years, Láďa did not forget to irritate him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from dietary chicken, American cucumbers or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," said Pear.
He's really serious about his involvement in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he said to Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not comment, because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Pear's participation in the culinary academy, taking the whole matter as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
Hruška gave Pohlreich his first cookbook in December 2004.
In a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve works.
In the last episode of his show Now the Boss is Cooking in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I just smile over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Láďa replied.
He thinks about Láďa’s culinary art.
"Cooking according to Ládi Hruška is not even an option at home, because I will not allow gastropunk to come home," he said.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken with honey.
But his recipes will not appear in my show," he did not forgive Pear.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical illiterate or idiot," Pohlreich said of Hrušek in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty, I can wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Hruška said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger, and is currently offering the same service through his BioTeq company to businesses and individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology.
The procedure is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service of replacing door locks and microchip-compatible cars. The price of one lock is 300 euros.
A married father of one has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House Props Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME weekly.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials watched the product parade from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records said.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and remain in place until the entire site is cleared, which was scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The email also stated that if there was a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening, along with a helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the TIME weekly - it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’ve been blocked,” the deputy commander replied.
This “Made in America” show was designated an official event by the White House, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
While attending the event, the president advocated health reform, which was going through the Senate, and talked about trying to rein in government regulations.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered an inspection in February after the presidential plane was flying in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' show, which showcased products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House's deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 crews often practice landings in the Washington area and on South Lawn, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew as part of “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House said no additional props were paid from taxpayers' money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations to display the helicopter on South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the show are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
“It’s very misleading to report taxpayer costs based on estimates of reimbursements,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursements of DoD expenses do not include personnel costs, but include fuel costs, maintenance, and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, advocated using the helicopter for the purposes of the show.
“The idea behind the show this week is to showcase products made in the U.S.,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact should be remembered.”
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. All that can be said for sure is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I own three myself."
A young woman was stranded in the swamp at Macha Lake, and police were wading towards her.
The girl went to the beach at about 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in wetlands.
When she decided to use her mobile phone to ask for help from a police officer, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols went to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through the reed marshes hundreds of meters before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
And she was also missing.
The police were guided by the direction in which her call for help was coming from.
"In order not to lose this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would count aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at three-quarters-of-five in a swamp in the Borný locality.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That is why the ambulance took her to the hospital in Česká Lípa.
Grandfather's connection to Stan?
A wanted bride becomes a selling girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project hladameslusny.cz, the billionaire basically tells voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also argued that a politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, had no national agenda for the House elections.
Her candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
This was the beginning of Vít Bárta and it didn’t work out very well.
Moreover, in his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the lists, as Gazdík admitted, Dědek also breaks the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement are politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to surveys.
They will now be replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
However, if only a few people suspected STAN of identity at that time, after the arrival of Grandfather, the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long opposed ANO Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference Grandfather, who publicly praises Babiš, stated as follows: "My goal is that the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayors movement, will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
My grandfather is a successful businessman and a billionaire.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party for some time, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the bride even more of a sell-out.
For some time Stan went with TOP 09, then with the people and now he is looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police Dogs Trained in the Bridge by Helicopter
Explosive search dogs and search dogs practiced helicopter overflights at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be fearful and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both trained adult dogs and those who are just going through the training were trained.
In addition to the standard training, during which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter trip.
"A helicopter will land, the dog will go and search immediately," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or unable to start working immediately after the helicopter ride is excluded from training.
"Most of them are kept by handlers, for example, in the garden," added Tomášek.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí nad Labem region with various specializations.
German shepherds are dominant, but Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he passes the first tests at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a sharp hit," Tomášek added.
The length of service depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Out of the Game and Cali Cartel Becomes the Centerpiece of Netflix's Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the murderer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the first one has already received the first trailer and a hint of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they escalate violent acts and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the union with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pena, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Mission, said hundreds of women were taking part in local council elections, three women were running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as all related processes that are related to the election.
Presidential and local elections are held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban has made several threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international combat activity to the other side.
In this year’s election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government hands over its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reported that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer to a resurgent brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobča u Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted into a steam engine operation in the nineteenth century.
It was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
During the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded the brewery’s declaration of a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was revived.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque Kokořín region, visit the pub in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use kokořín water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from lobeč fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you can taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, on top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of as many as twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground.
There was to be a headquarters, barracks, warehouses of ammunition, material, power plant, engine room and hospital.
Construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were breached.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building at the beginning of the 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is already 75% open!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification, as well as two infantry cabins, trenches and the Fortified Trutnov nature trail.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been added to the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotesov monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of extinction.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Dinner for the Chotešov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, among others, will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbariums and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they just came across on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application will recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Mountain Park in Bratislava as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took photos with teachers and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the website The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which it then assigns to the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant that is not yet in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková said.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's plant in Glasgow
Unions are demanding assurances from McVitie's biscuit manufacturer's managers about the long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent on a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area over the previous few years.
She added that workers and union representatives would be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, the Scottish GMB union expressed concern that McVitie's "will not receive its promises to finance and modernize the production lines."
GMB organiser Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the construction manager regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is of great concern to our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, pay and utility - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “The construction manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We discussed with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and operational efficiency.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local area, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t allow Neymar to join its side after it deposited ?189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but has the French team warned Barcelona about its record run three years ago?
The Ligue 1 club is ready to beat more than double the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, who paid 89 million euros for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive from the PSG team up to 500,000 euros per week.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has broken out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club that would be interested in taking over one of PSG's top players.
“I’m not afraid, because if someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seem to have crossed an imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the Italian representative to leave under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its presumptuous behaviour with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump has called for anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
A day earlier, Trump had written that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on.
It also makes me think of sanctions like straw.
These things can't be put in one bag.
Indeed, Maduro’s Venezuela has set out on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not acting the way the US president wants it to.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even an ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what the sanctions policy is based on and what system of rules it is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely re-imposing what President Obama has already prepared, he has just given it an implementing stamp.
Then why the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the US election, he would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosened, but tightened.
But Europe is even more scared.
Germany’s Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Are the sanctions only sanctioned by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Should sanctions be used only so weak as not to endanger anyone?
The ordinary voter nodded.
For three years he had heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now clear that this is an issue of EU energy security.
The voter is wider.
Sanctions are coming to Russia for mounting too much where it shouldn’t.
China is being bullied for not assembling enough.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their own rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, a rule, or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not thinking about cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubický Region, all candidates are already ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere with them.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian one be led by the governor and shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," Babis said.
You have upset many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors should manage municipalities and towns alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors.
I'm not talking about cancelling the deputies in my book, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
With a population of nine million, New York has five districts and 51 councillors.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is reproached for not building enough and did not prepare large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I’m not saying they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not in charge, he's just moderating the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you want a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have on the agenda is a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and a modification of the Rules of Procedure of the House to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and in committees, not to show off at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 MPs, abolish the counties and the Senate, and rule the entire country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there are 57,000 French for one legislator, while in our country it is 17,000 Czechs.
No one is accusing Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the movement.
We just need a team that works for the people in the government, not for their parties or ministries.
I do not understand, for example, why we could not agree to increase the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you be the Prime Minister for that?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency and would like to do business with the money of the state, like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, they are supposed to resolve disagreements outside of government.
There must be ready-made material in the cabinet, there is no place for coalition squabbles, force voting and business, there is a decision to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mainly party-oriented?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to the breaking of bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and he kicked Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has management skills, he does not need such empty gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you already know who you would propose to the finance minister?
I don’t think about it at all, we probably won’t even be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don’t know what I’ve done that’s so terrible.
So much scepticism is out of place.
The mayors have won an entrepreneur Grandpa, who would like to cooperate with you, maybe the wing of Jiří Čunek, who is inclined to you, will win.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO; Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be against it, may make his mark in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with the SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
Are you considering them as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he raised money for his company from the Dawn, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
Kind of brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, who speaks at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the second.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the program of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be banished, he never decided.
Coalition issues like ČEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and that, in my opinion, was also the reason why he fired me.
As soon as he did, ČEZ took over the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become the Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation on the Supervisory Board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
There are rumors that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange a good cooperation with ČSSD for an even better one with YES.
After the election, everything will continue.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Humble or Růžička lobbyists, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
Then answer me directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institution you criticize?
We want to be a transparent society.
So far, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to look at Mr. Schwarzenberg’s statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it has never managed it, it was there only in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate it, put it in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech Television?
Some of her shows have a permanent campaign against me, but I don’t have and won’t have any authority to fire anyone.
But mastery is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the way these reports are being discussed, the super power pact by Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to fire me from the government, which added a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds his power base by placing his son on the supervisory board of the Brno Heating Plant and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies such as the Prague Transport Company or České dráhy (Czech Railways) for a related lawyer Květoslav Hlín?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of anyone, no matter who it was.
