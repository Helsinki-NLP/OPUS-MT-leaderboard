According to Tatoeby guidelines, members are advised to only add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally-sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate the sentence only when you know what it means with certainty.
