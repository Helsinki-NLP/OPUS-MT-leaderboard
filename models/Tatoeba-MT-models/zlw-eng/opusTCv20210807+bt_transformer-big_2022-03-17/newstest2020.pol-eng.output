Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's charismatic.
For the Holy Masses he celebrates, the crowds gather for liberation and healing.
He was ten years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience this.
At the Holy Masses celebrated by Fr Witko for the release and healing of the crowds
He was once visited by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Astonished, the doctors said: “There is no need for surgery, the defect is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The priest began to experience the unusual actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him to ask for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying in the moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human characteristics and began to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to my human form,” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a calling in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease participate in the healing Masses celebrated by Father Witko.
However, the priest emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
This afternoon (26 September) the Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish champion Darts of Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
Jarosławians in such a personal statement, which they presented with the Grodziscians, have little chance of winning against the sovereigns of the league.
This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team still lacks Chen Jingqi, the team’s leader.
Perhaps with him in the squad, the Jaroslavans would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown up to win against the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The Hellada player was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class unto itself.
After three fights, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional five-set fight - Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
One could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not cope with Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why not?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was wrongly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of studies," the report said.
The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because the point is to lead to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard to imagine that expert specialists say: Let’s not examine ourselves, because there will be a longer queue at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, it’s not surprising that the health service is in such a state,” he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's pledge to annex the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, as it will be formed, goes ahead with this plan, we will cancel all the agreements signed [with Israel] and we will withdraw from all the commitments we have made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas said.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences - engaging fully in the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism," he said.
Netanyahu, Israel’s current prime minister, was re-elected after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election in the Palestinian territories during a session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one took place in 2006.
“When I return home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of “the rightful members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech with a call to the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with all due respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts directed against Israel than to fight calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s planned annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in critical points of Przemyśl
A history from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save people's lives.
The Regional Emergency Service Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be in critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Service Station in Przemyśl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and the Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. A Customs and Tax Service officer noticed an unconscious man lying in a pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called by the Communist Party secretary from her home village on 23 September to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body butchered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood,” the woman says.
“They wouldn’t let me bring my cell phone, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressed her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and had died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN programme on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR, there was, among others, the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling data transfer by users; a testing and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional improvement using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using the new PBR platform.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and support for entrepreneurs already reaching PLN 300 million under this sectorial program constitute an important impulse for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Incentives for innovative entrepreneurs introduced by the government, such as R&D credits, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive companies’ innovative activities and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market”, says Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin, Minister of Science and Higher Education.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also remains in their pockets - three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than in the previous year.
“The amount of deductible costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the two previous competitions, over PLN 211.2 million in funding was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The great interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“We are particularly pleased that among the selected projects, as in previous editions, there are projects concerning solutions serving not only entertainment, but also those related to Industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, business consortia and business consortia with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented as part of the Smart Growth Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
It happened on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajax in late August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
An angry Dane did not show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
Footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He came to Nice as a thirteen-year-old before making his debut in the first team three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but as reported by the newspaper L'Equipe, the club is likely to terminate it with immediate effect.
He has since begun disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you are washing your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to wash enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us do it less.
It is enough warm water and ordinary soap - it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (jointed or single) - rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (interlace the hands, rubbing the fingers against each other), thumbs - we cover each thumb with the other hand and in such a hug we turn it for a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door handles or doors with your washed hands (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
Iranian President Says He Rejected U.S. Talks Proposal, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the United States had proposed lifting all sanctions against Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
Iran’s president said he had not agreed to hold the talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the pressures of France, Germany and Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties of favoring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement “are a prerequisite that does not allow” to establish dialogue.
“If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and the maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian side’s request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no!” the US president tweeted.
Tension with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, of which they were signatories.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and put the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing's come of it.
Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has said that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of judges, was reinstated on Wednesday to be adjudicated by the NSA.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a case against him.
Even though the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, has to deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who due to suspicions of participation in the hate group was removed from the KRS office, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the hate group.
He claims to have no evidence other than forged screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
This is exactly what the other judges associated with “Kasta” say: everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll stand on their own.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not lift a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the content of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a report from February.
There is no evidence - there is no case of Scumbag, there is no case of Caste.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banas about renting the tenement house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he does.
The Parliamentary Ethics Committee will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow gathered to make a curious decision to dismiss Banasius’ deputies and appoint him as acting lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American I guess, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She is so astonished and devastated that she cannot utter a word.
She stands at the door speechless, and during this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Only that in the case of "Kasta" or Banasia there is a parody of the state.
And it's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after a break mother, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championships from London, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89, and in the second 1.92.
It only managed to get 1.94 in the third approach.
“I am pleased.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically," Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the eliminations, the best were American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik after 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who did not lose any height.
The women's jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki remains in hospital in serious condition
He was admitted to the hospital and his condition is described by doctors as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover," Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, told the Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by my immediate family and politics,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was taken to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for research.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer," the prime minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As told by Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, for which I am very grateful.
Fortunately, I don't have metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to get chemotherapy yet.
I put myself in the hands of medical professionals who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope everything will be all right,” Kornel Morawiecki told SE in January.
“If I were too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to this bastard,” he added.
The 14-year-old is missing

Missing on the evening of 26 September, she left her place of residence and has not returned or made contact with her loved ones.
She was last seen at Stary Gościniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blond hair and grey-blue eyes.
The last time she was seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of jumps.
The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
The road to true power is a long one, but this is what one of the types of horse rivalry is called.
The jumping competition consists in overcoming higher and higher obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth noting that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on a “Huaso” horse, is 247 cm.
Nobody jumped that high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local amazon at the level of 135 cm is also not the worst...
The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle” was a demonstration part of the “Rainbow Equestrian Competitions” played there a little earlier, which we write about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was joined by eight amazons, who trained riding in JKS in Olawa.
Four of them competed on ponies and four on big horses.
The first group was best managed by Nikola Szołdra, who was riding a crazy “Sprinter”.
This small but dynamic steed started with overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three more refusals was the jury of the competition removed from further competition.
The second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who was riding “Famy”, and the third place was taken by Lena Borun on “Harmider”.
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the amazon contestants and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The menacing falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who was riding the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the “Flight”.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the amazon or the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” to the show jumping.
We needed either a trainer’s assistance or another horse for the couple, followed by a little crazy “Vineta”.
After passing the obstacle from the showjumping, she also rode full gallop, so sometimes in the boxes and in the expansion room it was dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little bit with this frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska, riding a beautifully presented "Whisky" performed great on the show.
This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, was the first to jump 135 cm after the second approach in the final stage and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on the “Declaration”, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on the “Vinet” and Anastasia Abramenko on the “Flight”.
For the decoration of the fleet and to receive prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these athletes went together, and in the end, together with the amazon ponies in the rhythm of Radecki's march, they made an impressive honorary round, ending with this interesting and emotional competition.
Acknowledgements
The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the competition for the power of the jump during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Water and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Mayor and the "Mustang" company.
Max Kolonko cuts himself off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and KWW Patriotic Revolution itself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will be waiting for the above mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the aforementioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activities or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, we’ve had enough of your stupid games, we’ve had enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonko said at the time.
The party’s agenda includes issues related to the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the countries of NATO’s eastern flank, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately took place.
UBS: Gold close to the equilibrium point
“The euro exchange rate will remain close to the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak situation on global markets,” announces Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy support the stabilisation of the zloty’s quotations at the current level,” the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
"While the zloty is properly valued - the euro quotations should remain in the coming months around the ceiling of 4.35 PLN - the Polish bonds are not very attractive.
Much more favorable yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets”, says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation to Emerging Markets, UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
“The global slowdown may be even worse, but it should not lead to a severe recession, or at the most, to GDP dynamics falling slightly below zero,” announced Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should be underestimating global actions that may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively the least”, according to the latest letter to investors by the main manager of UBS Wealth Management, Mark Haefele.
Shares from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US ones, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the German 10-year yields to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term bonds should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of banks’ monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest scope for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is the USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential strengthening of the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further cuts in the Fed’s rates, which will result in a decrease in the global monetary policy gap.
“The dollar’s strength in the long run may not be sustained by current account and budget deficits,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential Report of the German Ministry of Defence
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential report prepared by the German Ministry of Defense.
This was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defense Peter Tauber (CDU), two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have been retraced so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns, and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
Martina Renner, vice-president of the Left Party, expressed her concern about the situation.
She told RND reporters that the number of weapons and ammunition missing was "disturbing".
As a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there is also a weapon that was found during the investigation against Bundeswehr lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
His “blacklist” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 50 explosives.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently implemented a feature designed for people who find travelling with a crying child a nightmare.
Via the website, the lines allow you to check the schedule of seats on the plane.
If a given connection is traveled by a minor up to the age of two, then the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place distant from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airline has already reported on the imperfection of this solution.
The “child icon” will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if there was a last-minute change of aircraft.
As you might expect, the idea divided the Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids.
“We need to learn tolerance, because we’re going to need a map of seating for mouth-breathing, drooling, or drunkards,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another internet user noted that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca Counts Losses After Travel Agency Bankruptcy Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be coming to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook travel agency on Monday.
Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, said on Friday that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October vacation in Majorca, there were also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers, who due to the bankruptcy of the British company had to give up their vacation in Mallorca next month, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands has already begun negotiations with international operators on "entering the Mallorca market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
Approximately 800 are laid off employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook in many hotels in Majorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional fee for accommodation.
This situation has been experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had stopped operations at least until the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy declaration by Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza newspaper reported that most of the Ibiza hotels that worked with the Thomas Cook group are not planning to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands announced that it would ask the Spanish government to support the region with an amount of 100 million euros to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the government of the Balearic Islands, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, about 5 million euros for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, the US in the lead
The Polish women’s national team is ranked 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July ranking.
Poor team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained American women, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, while the third place was held by the Dutch.
Polish women are preparing for their qualifications.
They were supposed to start their away game against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualification meeting with the Spanish women on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, the “White and Red” will play two friendly matches - on October 3 on the departure with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Polish women are Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from second place will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the baton for the last three passes to the European Championship.
At the rate of 16 participants will be completed by the host - England.
Poland’s men’s national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog has crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are small, and the coal stoves will kick in this winter as if nothing had happened,” reads the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
“So far, as part of the Clean Air program, 82 thousand applications have been submitted for funding with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions have been positive.
Accepted applications amount to a total of over PLN 915 million", reports "Rz", citing data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only a part of the costs incurred is refunded from the program.
The results of the announced program are rated by the journal as "modest".
Local government officials, quoted by “Rz”, see the failure of “Clean Air”, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by post, possible random check of implementation.
This would improve the activities," says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alert note that in the first year of the operation, less than 1% of the assumed goal of replacing 3 million mound boilers was achieved.
According to “Rz”, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year was only PLN 1.4 billion,” we read.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The US Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but it is not the end of our work,” Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” he added.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force is to supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The investment will support U.S. national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO’s ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support and training of personnel.
Lockheed Martin F - 35
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multirole fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombing and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
The F-35 fighter jets were recently bought by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, will also consider the purchase of U.S. combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of gender-neutral dolls to the market.
This is how he fights stereotypes.
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie is to have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Gender dolls no longer have full lips, long lashes and a slim waist or, in the case of Ken, broad shoulders.
The company believes that children don’t like their dolls to have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will make all children feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes”, such as unnatural body proportions, for example.
The company responded to the criticism and has already launched dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There are also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: club or club Together can have more than a dozen members
When Zandberg was asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing parties (the KW SLD from which the list is running candidates for the Sejm of the SLD, Spring and the Left Together, running with the common logo of the “Left”), he replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people associate hope with the fact that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 MPs.
“This may mean that the club or club Together will have a dozen or so members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
“I’m not going to guess and tell you how it’s going to happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We have an agreement that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by differing, we were able to agree on a common program."
Asked if Włodzimierz Czarzasty is the biggest beneficiary of the joint start, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, to the point that the SLD will get the entire subsidy, he replied that “the goal of a political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the Senate elections, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates who are closer to my heart, but there are also those who are further away from my heart,” he said.
"But I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the Senate district 44, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," he said.
“I don’t think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (a candidate of KO - PAP),” he added.
In this district, apart from Ujazdowski, the leader of the Polish Citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are competing.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built that could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare wetland area donated by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Paths to Paradise") is derived from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, revered by his followers as a saint.
The mosque is clad in Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the other as many can stay on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors, you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.
Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was funded by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a victory will be interrupted by the players of the Crown in Friday’s meeting with the deputy leader of the Silesian extraclass.
“Our problem is not the residents of Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” emphasized coach Mirosław Smyła.
The players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when they defeated 1-0 benjaminka of the Częstochowa Cancers.
Later, Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday's match in Korona certainly will not play a pauser for the excess of yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the team will also lack injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
However, it is a building point to register in the cup match of several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, it seemed to be gone recently, and now it is,” Smyła said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without winning, while in the extraclass everyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
“We may not be showing it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” he said.
After nine rounds of the extraclass, the Crown with a score of five points takes the 15th position.
Silesia has amassed 12 more and ranks second.
Friday's game in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees could disappear from Europe.
“42 per cent of the tree species that make up Europe’s state of the art are at risk,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and rowan.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
The study was carried out by experts who concluded that 42 percent of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere) are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
According to IUCN, 58% of species are at risk of extinction and 15% of trees and shrubs (66 species) are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, over-intensive tree felling, followed by forest fires and changes in the European eco-system.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European Office of IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them distribution on credit for freedom, which will have to be repaid by future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away”.
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea for defeating Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot boxes.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczyński party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.
“First of all, nothing given will be taken away, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work diligently - and those who are enterprising”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes, among others, a project that will give the least-earning Poles more PLN 614 per hand, and more earners - also several hundred.
The politician also said he did not want to race for the handouts.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he will not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition for the distribution, until finally the financial collapse of the country took place,” he stressed.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Pride steps before the fall.
Kaczynski is such a statesman, as Banas is crystal,” he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether he will run for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: The Six Dead Condors
Six giant condors have been found dead in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Great condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten the toxic carcass.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss for the environment because the condor has to be 10 to 15 years old in order to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we’re losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm - we read in Rzeczpospolita.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rz" reports that such a chain may soon hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to begin work on an amendment to the law on orders and decorations in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would consult the Chancellery of the President.
This came in mid-September.
“I would like to kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” presidential minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The President's office answered us briefly: it is in favour of restoring it," said the head of the commission Robert Mamątow from PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which was supported by the committee.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive across the intersection
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.
The actions of uniformed people are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "Transit crossings".
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, not following light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, but in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city.
His words were heard at a press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among others, faster starting at the lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The topic has been taken over by the Rzeszów police officers, who are starting the “Transit Crossings” campaign from today.
What is it?
The aim is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to the intensification of difficulties in movement and the formation of traffic jams.
He is threatened with a fine of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of smoothness of driving, late departures from the signals, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
At which intersections will the activities be carried out?
Among others, at ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellońska; al. Cieplińskiego from al. Piłsudskiego; Targowa street from al. Piłsudskiego; Plac Śreniawitów from ul. Dąbrowskiego or ul. Hetmańska from al. Insurgents of Warsaw.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on the following Fridays of October.
They checked the company that used the waste from the "Czajka"
"Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wołomiński County and the District Construction Supervision Inspectorate inspected an installation in the Zielonka commune on Friday, where waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of," said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the Wołomińskie District Mayor.
Inspectors from the Wołomińskie starosty conducted an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka commune.
Private Trade and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under a contract with the capital sewage treatment plant "Czajka" performs waste management services.
"The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, as well as did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal at the excavation site, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in forests near Zielonka.
Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOŚ was decommissioned, which was associated with damage to one of the incinerator equipment.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wałęsa told Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” said the candidate of the Civic Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “just a retired fan”.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wałęsa’s son, Jarosław.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” Lech Walesa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems ahead of Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us - those who love Poland - will maximally support your actions," said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for their support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is," she said.
“Let’s show that you can do other, wise policies, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-Błońska stressed.
Fans in retirement
Wałęsa told reporters that he is now "just a retired fan".
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, we will return.
The separation of powers is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are absolutely necessary.
And it all needs to be cleaned up, it all needs to be restored to normal operation, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we face a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the elections, think and make their own decision.
And this is the most important thing,” Kidawa-Błońska added.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of affairs in Poland,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which to do all the other things.
If the separation of powers does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it a matter of course and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.”
Slovenia vs. Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with Slovenians in the semi-final of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The Reds lost 3-1 and won the bronze medal.
Senate Decides on Key Laws
The Senate adopted without amendments the Act on the Disclosure of Family Assets of the Most Important State Officials and on Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
52 senators voted for the amendment to the law on the family property of state officials, 14 voted against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled by Senator Sławomir Rybicki during the Wednesday debate.
According to him, the amendments were to “civilize” the law and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the financial situation of own children, children of the spouse, children prepared for cases in which children remain in a common household with a person obliged to make a statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Most Important State Officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister’s office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The regulations stipulate that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those who are at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to include information about the personal property of spouses, children and people living together in a financial statement.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 against and four abstentions.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight “performed in an official mission”.
The President will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “taken for the purpose of performing tasks directly related to the function performed”.
The law also clarifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft - invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
According to the Act, in the event of doubts regarding the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.
New representative of sport
Waldemar Paluch appointed his representative for physical culture, sport and tourism.
It was Artur Świątek, long-term president of the AZS PWSTE University Club Jarosław, for the last 4 years director of the Rector’s Office of the Jarosław University.
Artur Świątek has recently been heavily involved in the project of reactivation of basketball in Jarosław.
Artur Świątek is not an anonymous person in the Jarosław sports environment.
A graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in Biała Podlaska since 2002, he has been an instructor at the State University of Technology and Economics in Jarosław, and for 15 years he has been the President of the University.
Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play in the bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's way to win the title was closed by Thursday's 1:3 defeat to the Slovenes in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of talk about their problems with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems - on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they did their training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the people present in the class, the world champion trainer was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.
“We went to the arena, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought down to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We always thought we would come back to this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for the defeat, I would point out ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual to deal with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" was not hindered by the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the world champions could have been slightly put to sleep by the smooth road to the semi-finals.
“Maybe if we had a similar setback in the group stage, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly and played differently later in the tournament.
“It’s just a scratch,” he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat will be transformed into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope we can show our true selves.
There's a lot to fight about.
“We won the medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during this championship.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-finals they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: harsh punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine - in a six-month suspension - for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgios, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the misdemeanors of the most unruly professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous - 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year - a trial period in which a recalcitrant athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he’s been in trouble for a long time and has set a tennis world record, having to pay the highest penalty in the history of the discipline for violating the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a lost match against Karen Khaczanov - for all this, after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, he paid 113,000 dollars.
He also did not play long at the 2019 US Open, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists were “corrupt”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, his words about corruption were forgiven, after listening to the accused and learning the context of the speech.
Tennis officials said the investigation found Kyrgios' behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, and that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately adjourned his sentence, ordering him to comply with several conditions over the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the audience, or behave in any other way.
He was also recommended to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also to consult with people who specialize in solving problems of athletes who are not coping with proper behavior.
The first comment (on social media) from Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Lavera Cup his shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up the next starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
He won two tournaments this year in Washington and Acapulco, earning more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
According to the report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, 44% of households rated their financial situation as good or rather good last year.
The figure was 37.2% a year earlier, 33.5% in 2016, and never more than 30% since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of self-employed households is the best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the other extreme are the households of pensioners, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.
The number of children also greatly influences the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst situation is experienced by single parents, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents and large families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is growing faster than real income.
What is more, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average last year, and in Lubusz it amounted to 98%.
The highest incomes were recorded in Mazowieckie (120% of the national average) and Śląskie (104%).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1,693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows, it also slows spending growth.
These amounted to PLN 1187 per person last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household now spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while still in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

Three suicides among the crew of the aircraft carrier
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the US Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide occurred in July this year and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land as the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Deaths are not related.
“Everyone needs to be involved in making suggestions and ideas about how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help," Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
Critical criticism of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every word was accepted.”
Later, criticism came of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was not able to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media in the best way during the life of the Polish Pope," he explained.
A former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: “there were murmurs of discontent, the Pope said something, he once did not accept Rydzyk, but he had the power and for politics he could simply expel him from the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successor,” Niesiołowski explained.
“Besides this fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their lack.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
The extent of pedophilia in the Church has been known for quite some time.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he says in an interview with the journalist Niesiołowski.
In the opinion of the former politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are scribes, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the scribe regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly,” Niesiołowski argued.
“I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.
Tomorrow we celebrate the 590th anniversary of the county.
There will be concerts and auctions.
The jubilee gala will take place in Hrubieszów Culture House.
First, at 10 a.m., the Holy Mass will begin in the Church of St. Nicholas.
The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 in HDK.
The Song and Dance Ensemble of the Hrubieszów Land will perform.
Young people from Stanisław Staszic’s 1st High School will present a performance entitled “Grubieszów District: From here my family - here I live”.
Then they will be awarded the medal “Merited for the district of Grubieszów”.
At 4 p.m., the event will move to the city promenade, where the concerts of “Hrubieszów charity for Angelika Zińkiewicz” will take place.
They will play disco polo bands - NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the star of the evening Mig.
There will be auctions, including pens and porcelain of the Prime Minister.
PZPN throws penalties for riots in stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The clash in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk did not end tragically, when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović, batted by fans from Wejherowo, passed by millimeters.
After this incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to leave in groups for league matches until 31 December.
Burdy at the Widzewa Łódź stadium was also called by fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed the Łódź fans’ sector to be hurled, the chairs to be set on fire and the host sector to be forced through.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban also applies to Ekstraklasa league matches, but it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the spelling of names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set by the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, easier to read and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of localities in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in the law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the signposts along our roads.
We are starting the introduction of the new signage from the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway,” said Andrzej Adamczyk, Minister of Infrastructure.
In Podkarpacie, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set by the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand. zł.
In the first place, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by November 1, 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be done without replacing the boards, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning names of localities with new ones written in Polish on already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one line - first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
It will be a great convenience for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windbreaker
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had made a target out of the animal - a shot from a windbreaker was found in his body.
“Information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sól.
The report said the animal had broken its wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray was taken, it was already known that someone had made a shooting target out of it.
There were fragments of pellets in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a company managing, among others, a rehabilitation center.
Wintering in the resort
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He is not able to fly yet.
The release of him now would be associated with the fact that he would most likely not survive the winter," adds Walasek.
Staff after undergoing rehabilitation swan intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the Żukowice municipality, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
It happened on purpose.
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small-scale trade”
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.
During an interview in Signals of the Day in Radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot develop.
To the attention that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the deputy prime minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term, but got a “counter from the EC”.
“We have won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, we will return to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small, trade”.
“It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax is an illegal state aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the design of the tax could favour smaller stores, which could be considered state aid.
It further stated that the levy had been implemented unlawfully.
It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until officials in Brussels had completed their analysis of the tax.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
An EU court decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not complete the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press services of the CJEU informed PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure will start, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to a dozen or so months from the appeal to the delivery of the judgment.
“This procedure takes an average of one year,” a source at the Luxembourg Court told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer several practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world.
So it’s no wonder that new moms and dads want their kids to look their best on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child’s outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops you can find many outfits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, babies were baptized for several weeks, dressed in white sets and put in the same beckons or large pillows.
Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: several months, a year, and even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great comfort needs a slightly different outfit for baptism .
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best solution will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this item of clothing is considered everyday attire, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example, with a frill or lace.
For the boy, the body with a bow tie and braces will turn out to be ideal.
For older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls look with longing towards richly decorated, ruffled christening dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers for their product use artificial, non-breathable materials, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothing, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and charming sets will make your little girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caskets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable, cotton ensembles.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse decorated on the front in the pattern of a vest.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrain the movements of the little one getting to know the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a declaration of assets at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS MP has accumulated PLN 110,000 in savings.
Let us recall that Pavlovich announced her departure from politics.
At the end of his term, he has $110,000.
According to the statement submitted by the MP, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,700.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
She also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a property statement.
Voting on a recess for the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual program conference, which the government has requested.
There were 289 votes in favour and 306 against.
As a rule, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign from participation in them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties have decided that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK’s planned departure from the European Union on 31 October, the parliament should not interrupt the session.
The government’s request for a recess was supported by 289 MPs, against by 306.
Two opposition parties after the convention
The lack of consent for a recess can be seen as the opposition’s political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled the decision illegal and not excusable) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges’ ruling.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing tumultuous debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“The time has come to deliver Brexit.
It needs to be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be done so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already been held.
One of the justifications Johnson gave for such a lengthy suspension of parliament was for party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media wrote.
The president's spokesman strongly denied the reports.
“That’s just not true,” Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing the Jewish Insider, write that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel is to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that “Poles have sucked out anti-Semitism with their mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: “Pole, Pole”.
“A quote is not only inaccurate.
That’s just not true,” Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Duda never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.
According to the interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, decorated with the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it was the Jews of Israel “such as Israel Katz” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach, Mosberg’s speech was to be interrupted.
Who is Banaš and what is his fault?
The tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banas's property statements.
We conclude with another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
Journalists of TVN’s “Superwizjer” revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered a 400-meter-high tenement house in Kraków’s Podgórze district in recent years.
What’s more, his sub-tenant was supposed to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly a loan repayment security since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Superwizjer" program.
The journalist revealed that the tenement house was rented by people connected with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings”.
The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banas responded to the allegations vaguely and murkyly.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The tenement house itself was described in a vague way, and the income from its lease was to be underestimated.
“The assets of Marian Banas and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an inspection of Marian Banas’s property declarations for the years 2015-2019.
Banaś announced that he would suspend his activity in NIK until its completion. “I will ask your marshal for a free leave,” he assured.
The opposition wants an explanation.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banas’s financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]", - said MP Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole so grossly underestimated the rental of his real estate, he would already have 10 inspections, tax additions and criminal and fiscal proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Audit Office.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was put forward by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Banaś was associated with NIK in the years 1992-2005., he worked in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first rule of PiS (2005-2008), Banaś held the position of the President of the Customs Service and, moreover, the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has again sat on the chair of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Tax Administration.
Banaś served for 3 months as the Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master Launches Graphics Card Holder
Graphic cards can now weigh a lot, and this naturally makes room for categories of products that would have been useless to look for on store shelves even a decade ago.
This is exactly what the Cooler Master has come up with - a mount for the ELV8 RGB graphics card.
The new model of the graphics card holder is not only a functional solution that allows you to more confidently maintain the graphics card without relying only on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task - decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, a police officer’s disregard of a warrant for certain conduct is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest, or restriction of liberty.
Police unions want to make such a change.
The idea went to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases go to Polish courts,” we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition that the Independent Union of Police Officers is writing to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance to succeed.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: "Anyone who does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be liable to imprisonment, fine or restriction of liberty."
“Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who, by failing to follow orders, prevent or hinder the performance of an official activity,” the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it could be used in political demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and instead of easing the situation, they would exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today exchanged in a row with Václav Havel.
From the very beginning, Jáchym has been cursed with a talent that he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with a "Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Soňa with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are just a background for observing the world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of stuffy provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and promiscuous youth.
The “sensitive man” sometimes turns into an absurd theatre.
The narrative mimics the didascalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get their money back.
The Ghent court also declared the three Belgian subsidiaries Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services bankrupt.
Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the British company's bankruptcy announcement by its mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
Creditors demanded that, in addition to the 900 million pound rescue plan agreed in August, the company raise an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been mounting for several years, resulting in a debt of up to 1.6 billion pounds.

Goerlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for a review - such an unusual offer was prepared for the newcomers German Goerlitz.
The action is to help fight the ongoing decline in the city’s population.
Goerlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.
The lowest wages in Germany are in Goerlitz.
The city is also facing a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25 percent drop in the city’s population.
In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 proposals have been submitted.
Two-thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we applied, we thought that the program was to convince people to move to Goerlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter if we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the program participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma.
