Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, up 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
Particularly strong losses were suffered by the Austrian People's Party, where the position of the current chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZI), the Carinthia governor, Jurg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country's Social Democracy (SPP) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but against the last election in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the vote.
Even worse was the VP, which lost with 25.6 percent to almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and especially for the people who triggered the early elections, a literally disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the VP left the coalition, the people had a significant advantage over the SP.
However, voters have apparently punished them for letting the government crash.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an emergency meeting of the party's presidency.
Such a development would probably facilitate the way to the still most likely way out of the election result, i.e. the resumption of the grand coalition of the SSP and the PDP.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPO) - they provisionally won 18 percent of the vote and the BZ - eleven percent of the vote - at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed concern about a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPO was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZ - split) on the joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already said he is ready to work with any party and expects a return to Vienna for national politics, seems to be betting on this development.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently broke the 4% threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji today.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherji said after the hearing that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls to.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherži, to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await his sentence at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the matter is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side is already providing them with such help.
"We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a profound mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter was avoided by the minister.
“I’ve made quite a few promises,” he said.
Czech judges fight for seabed
It will access a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division on Oceans and Law.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There is work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a still little known world, rich in natural resources.
Here you can find oil, ores and other minerals, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the land
Today, the coastal states began to apply vehemently for new underwater territories.
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, they are exercising their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often even beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the demarcation of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has examined five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far,” adds Mikulka.
The world has recently seen the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions.
But New Zealand has also gained - the area of the seabed, which the commission granted him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years after they have ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, declared by convention to be the "common heritage of mankind".
No country has an exclusive position anymore.
The mining right in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a Klondike", says director Mikulka in exaggeration, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a "pioneer investor" under the Convention, as were the investors of a few other states.
It is licensed to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is indented there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra Mountains.
"It can be mined on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings to the show one such concretion.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical shem that, according to legend, revived Golem.
The German special forces were freed from the hostages.
Egypt's government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but the deployment did not take place.
Further details of the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually coming to the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and Interior.
According to the ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, the Federal Police squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene.
However, according to a further statement by the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces, as the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the action on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payment.
The survivors are now safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet on when the rescuers will return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, all five tourists should fly with special forces one of the Airbuses of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress let a $700 billion bailout package fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones Index fell sharply.
By 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, no majority has been found for a program to ease the chaos in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, the advocates were desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for a vote of approval before the MP, though, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to concerns from investors that the state bailout might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, so that after the announcement of the shipwreck of the package, it fell sharply again.
Experts are now counting on more severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record growing numbers of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German businessmen in tourism:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains undisturbed.
For winter season bookings, travel agencies saw a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, according to the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased numbers of reservations available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, the turnover for October was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK figures, which evaluates reservation data from 1,200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included travel bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar, trips to the US are in demand, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly desirable destinations for Germans, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, organized tours are on course, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food expenses, the costs are "easier for the client to calculate than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by, among other things, taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so there will be a higher turnover again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated pop, beer from dullers and celebrities in costumes from well-known designers.
First time on a beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not yet three minutes on the beer field, and already photographers are rushing at us and quickly filling memory cards - that's flattering, because I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But as soon as you arrive at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman’s costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The strange views at the banana stand in chocolate are only picked by my apron.
A Munich woman points out to me that I wrongly tied her up: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are set, widowed in the back."
I'll move my bow from the back to the left in secret.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others are less concerned with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and stick out on passers-by's naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved of his drunken temper.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is thus one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers", as people in Bavaria are called in public free urination people.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, health workers run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place, taking care of poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the sheet of this coffin of pardons is not to be seen.
"It's the ones that can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in answer to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkey's Diplomatic Horizons Expand
Long before Turkey began its bid to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the east bank of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
Tourist guides will tell you that.
The building sits astride the end of platforms with a tower on each corner of the facade, a sight indistinguishable from any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vault, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which joined the empires late, intended to implement its ambitions for control of the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the Hydarpasha station as well.
In 1917, an ammunition train blast destroyed her elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, they have been gradually crumbling and history has been bypassing it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on the tracks that reminded the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Mail documentary, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift of the Turkish consensus.
It raised suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP's main tent, an ultramodern stone and metal building, purposely built in an emerging suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power dealers, where middle managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
You have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But there will certainly come a time," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to have to be made."
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to said almost by heart: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks eastward into Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched how this building was being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited for the ferry back through the Bosphorus at the port, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating land.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music supervisor since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's musical plan, he established the excellent Proteus Youth Choir for a year.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up that choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in whatever music was presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His batting technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the standard of music was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "pulled through the world one or two soaking stones".
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while also studying for a BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's comment by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition 'Flamenco a života' because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was captivated by the simplicity and strong charge with which it impresses the viewers, and by the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will launch its best-seller for the second time
In November, Honda will begin selling the second generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
Added to this are improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel efficiency.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-space car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a lesser-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Almost one million units have been sold in Japan since the introduction of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase sales in its category with the new Jazz.
That is, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 estimates count 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
As a result, the company’s management expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, and a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door, compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year when it will be presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 metres (five centimetres more), its width to 1.69 metres (two centimetres more), and its wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions has also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved both by using the new platform and by placing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage compartment volume - which has a double bottom system - increased to up to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the luggage compartment volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with the 1.4 engine version, since the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
In addition to the exterior features - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a panoramic glass roof - it is easier to access the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of the Honda Jazz, there are also new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers outstanding improvements to the drive system at the same time with high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2 litre engine has 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp on the previous generation Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation reached 83 hp, the current one will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan has been inspired by nature, specifically bees, to develop accident protection technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the role of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in rain prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Center for Technological Advancement have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious Tokyo University.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of public relations for the brand's technology, research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four safety shield zones.
The robot’s task is to strengthen the collision prevention capabilities of the brand’s vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot can not move up and down even diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction that is made possible by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to maintain itself according to this data.
It does not require information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kilobytes of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about gigs or megas.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion ones.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be admitted that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, is also not lacking in resourcefulness.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, they created the popular educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It wasn't a bad credit hotel... or a mixed-up hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, looks bleak to make you think once, twice, or three times about whether it’s the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site more suitable for youth than space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because it is better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, is entering the stock market with a $9 billion investment to raise 21% of its capital.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a single price of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which provide a 10% return and have an exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the entire operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares, however, fell 6.79% and hit $23.07 around 5pm Greenwich Mean Time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
The new statute was passed by Morgan Stanley last week to allow him to diversify his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest aces from Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than before.
Among other things, the terms presented on Monday show that the deal has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for roughly $8.5 billion.
“Just a week ago, we thought,” Toshihide Mizuno, the MUFG’s executive director, explained in Tokyo, “our participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7 % less than the book value of Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement foresees that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into current shares within a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group's spokesman declined to provide further details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "significantly" lowered his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” from Wall Street’s major investment banks following the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establishing a republic around 21st century socialism.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, the draft of a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
"No" according to these results gained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the bill to pass, it had to win half the votes plus one.
Two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and the count of NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday.
"The Constitution has prevailed," he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place peacefully according to the Organization of American States (OEA) observation mission, concerned a text on 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving to it the "planning of development" of the country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, backed by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as the starting point for U.S. drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando took 11 tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days ago by an attack.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were brought to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
The hostages arrived around 3.30 pm, apparently in good shape, aboard a special plane to al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken, without being able to express themselves in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a peripheral residential district of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egypt's tourism minister Zoheir Garrana said on the airport's runway.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard of the director of the agency Aegyptous, the organizer of the safari.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of the special forces who approached the scene aboard two helicopters had taken to the jet during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half of the hijackers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of Egypt's special forces from the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they gained the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our intelligence services, from special forces," he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese military said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying the hijackers, killing six including a Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to denounce the poor sums that are being given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national landmarks that are starving?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, a federation of societies for Quebec history, at least 40,000 volunteers affiliated to 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogy seek to unravel history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often these societies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which, driven by despair, protest when promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the tribune for history and monuments?
the Governments of the Benelux State Bank Fortis
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, partial nationalisation: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Bank Fortis is the first in the euro area to experience a major crisis as part of the international financial markets crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made on this matter could be seen as precedents in some respects.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will sell part of its capital holdings, mainly insurance activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of the crisis in the institution.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let go of.
The company's securities fell 12% on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company’s leaders.
Indeed, the company’s management blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan.
By Monday, the stock had risen slightly.
On Friday, new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet applied with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been taken by storm.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people’s data about buying drugs, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescribing data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox," Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of insurance claims dependent on the health status of the candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too great, they do not even take out insurance with it.
In the past, they sent people for medical examinations and concluded contracts only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the pharmacy customer can easily find out what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself will deduce what kind of disease he is suffering and what is his state of health.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to having virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so that the insurance company has almost no work left except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, useful against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, while the previously mentioned difficulties do not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been set up to ask for the patient’s consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it will be more and more difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control even companies specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the permission in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat reliant on the fox of good will after all.
The Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, the agenda of the Ninth High Level Meeting has dominated this topic among other, mostly global, issues.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak out in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to find a common denominator in supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday's ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade turnover will double in five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overambitious target.
Twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally aligned, and air transport has been given the green light in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised that negotiations will be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit also focused on global issues.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and called for an urgent UN conference.
They also insisted on ending the Doha Round of trade negotiations, although both have played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the need for a global agreement at next year’s climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to discuss the financial crisis.
India’s prime minister will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to close a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will be entrusted with the construction of India’s 20 billion euros worth of nuclear reactors.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would have been valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international rights exchange meeting.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries at this edition, occupying 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) - on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a press meeting at the Buchmesse Room Structures in Hall 5.0: an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is still decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada, was found.
The debris was discovered on a single plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Madera County sheriff, John Anderson, dismissed the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying in on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) announced that hours after the debris was detected, an investigation team was dispatched to identify the plane: it was exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by one couple near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has earned a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world journey in an air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, advertising you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "compact" jeep house star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, the communication that will accompany the launch of Suv Glk will be unexpected and unconventional, and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that accompanies the debut of the new car will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses, which will be handed out near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, and then reassembled in a single image.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which has never, to be honest, made excessive trouble.
He has never met his opponent’s fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (actually few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslo, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and a match banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to at least the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not enter any more stadiums.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added to it.
“We need to put out this fire right now and not justify those who behave in this way,” they said.
So, "well-opened eyes, mainly for the national game on Wednesday in Leča".
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of problems in stadiums.
"Glee Leader and strained arm during Mameli's anthem? It's not a crime in Bulgaria...".
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorio for a few weeks (he obtained the place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, are located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Osservatorium One, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistling of Mameli’s hymn: it is not a crime either, but if you please, it is rudeness...”.
