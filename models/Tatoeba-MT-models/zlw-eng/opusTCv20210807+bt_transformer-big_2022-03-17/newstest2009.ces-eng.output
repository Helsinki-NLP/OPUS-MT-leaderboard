The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its decline on Monday as it fell by almost 6% from the start of Tuesday’s trading.
This time, the stock market is falling on Wall Street.
This reflects the market’s reaction to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
The Fall of Stocks in Asia
Stocks in Asia fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indices eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has written off nearly four percent of its trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, the head of Hong Kong’s monetary authority.
Hong Kong, despite being a part of China, sets its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are the same as those of the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should urgently return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Other countries are also at risk of being affected.
The Bloodbath of American Action
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw their biggest downturn in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and the last time it fell was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill had not passed in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush's administration have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout plan for the U.S. financial system.
However, it has not yet been won.
Congress has to finalize some of the details of the deal before they can publish the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
According to sources, the plan could be voted on in the Senate first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "sober up" due to the complexity of the mechanisms that help the markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences over what the package looks like to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
On Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
He should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Nevada Senator Harry Reid said lawmakers were trying to reach a deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two houses of Congress will vote on the bill, or whether they can get stuck in the negotiations at the last minute.
Lawmakers are hoping it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the scheme is to be split into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as demanded by President George Bush.
However, Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not performing its function, in turn, another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the negotiations.
The president can veto the decision, but Congress can override it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has remained.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitations of Gold Parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said that lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the concessions, timing the funding plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made great progress toward a deal that works and is useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have repayment problems.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys, in order to reduce the monthly cost of installments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That's because we don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought back.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide their losses,” Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not that important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Clash on the blade of a knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice entirely depends on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
It is probably difficult to get a top expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album on it.
On the one hand, such music products are not based on LP records and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if there are vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It is the same with music on the go, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also depends on the battery life
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles can't do.
No device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to its primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy grabs.
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, you should expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without reduction with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
With the exception of iPod players, you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library sorted by artist name, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more efficient
When choosing a particular device, be interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, comfort of operation.
If music is primarily a backdrop and you listen to it only briefly every day, for example on a tram, you can use any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Almost any cell phone can do that.
You don’t even have to watch what music formats your phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most popular and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and buy the song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument in itself for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to fast-paced radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phone with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the lack of output to regular headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm socket for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common cassette player or turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet and subsequently a giant account for data transmission.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can cope with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are a more demanding listener, it is better to use specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to become cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetration well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ), often points out that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably does not have many chances (by the way, he would hardly look for frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, which classic operators had to react to.
At the same time, before the launch of pike such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices sounded in the UK as in our country.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns, among others, U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to work effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on an innovative target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offer."
In the Czech Republic no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, it tries to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
GTS Novera has long been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe it’s for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the emergence of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónika O2 in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.”
He adds: “There will be hardly any virtual operator on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be able to think in this short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators are interested in something, they can pull together is also evidenced by the tug around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, U:fon can be used as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: “More recently, the competitive environment of the mobile market has been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
It is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took a typical stance on the issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office for Human Rights in response to our question.
From the representatives of the operators, this statement is probably not surprising.
It is more than respectable from an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
Obviously, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not among the interests of the Office.
In fact, what is shocking about the whole case is the touching resonance of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is offered all by itself.
As well as the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly just a matter of chance and fierce competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a correspondingly increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecom regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by CTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it necessarily has to be dominant.
Even if we do not admit this argument, it should be at least alarming for the Office that three mobile operators act in a strikingly similar way.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
Placing responsibility on CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, with which the Office puts its hands away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in extending the powers of the CTU to the area of competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This must be known more than well by the representatives of the Office, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's looking.
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
This is usually a multi-level marketing company.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The prices of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Kemrová said.
However, it is unlikely that such activities would not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question is raised for the OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office has relatively strong powers to detect such activity, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they are unaware of such a thing and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When will we not be the most expensive?
As it has fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decrease in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Their arguments were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was in these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and more were packed onto it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that the ambiguity in competence in these cases is more than convenient for them.
But let's not flip.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us really soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators has allowed the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the Office to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the price than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood presented new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and instrumental version.
The song was performed by Kateřina Knezínková and Adam Plachetka.
The hymn was edited by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who were distinctive and popular for singing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then also the congregation, had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in harmony," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was first played in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it as their own.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague public transport will take a ride on the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it is possible to buy about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it uploaded to their chip card in the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers used the service in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and upload it to their Opencard at one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, there is a counter with trained staff available to passengers to help with online shopping and also upload a purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several subway vestibules.
What do these automatons look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers and passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
The coupon will check the slot driver's place
Operation of the machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are used mainly by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers, using which they check the time and zone validity of coupons," Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles timetables for Prague's public transport, explained.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register of the driver.
When boarding, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," he added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service machines where card coupons are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked for the incorporation of the Šumava into the United States.
This follows from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States with such a wish.
This follows, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov are asking the American president in a letter not to allow the return of the "Šumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads.
Since joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president plead to take over the protectorate over Šumava for the present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would grant this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign up is allegedly fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States were to doubt the thinking of the Šumava Germans, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava county on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that this would be their expulsion from the Czech Republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war he was a German from Budějovice deployed to the navy in the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would be useful for them," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Beneš’s decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, and on leaflets.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them, before they leave, to fasten their seatbelts.
It wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in the pool of blood, there's the word "you pay."
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay with his own life for a moment of inattention.
The viewers will be "scared" of the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of accident victims can be commonly seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver is covered by a system of sugar and whips.
Sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," said Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
And that is why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist thinks.
There are signs that are less effective to warn drivers of danger.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the territories," Olmert told the daily.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage, because without that there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn’t want his feet run over by tractors or bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, an essential condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to Hamas terrorism, Al Qaeda terrorist networks and jihad in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
They are not allowed to walk on the long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is in violation of the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by a driver of a truck crossing the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical certificate.
If it is not homologated on the bus, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing places; this was confirmed by the company’s director Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the ministry and did not allow the movement of passengers at first.
Then they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving, if they have their seat," he said.
The Law of Stewardship
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no law prohibits a carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle’s driver; it does not define its rights and obligations,” Hanzelka added.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to stand in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
The buses are divided into urban, where there are places to stand and limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand at a higher speed and remote without places to stand at the highest speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says expert
BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to servicing in airplanes.
It is not clear when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head."
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be dealt with by the carriers by internal regulations," he says and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
They employ two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But if I think the stewards' profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was an immense tragedy
A young stewardess from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the line to Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably swerved without using a turn signal from the parking lane and blocked the path of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but stumbled on it with the right front part.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places can not be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court to pronounce, but financial compensation is also expected from the culprit.
A change in the law?
In sight
An amendment to the law, which is being worked on for over a year by a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movement of stewards on board the bus.
“But there was no specific conclusion.
Buses don’t really solve much, but rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of a mobile phone while driving,” says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would significantly threaten the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that the control of bus safety is the competence of the police and labour safety authorities.
The hope of Dusseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in WestLB’s letter to the bank’s employees.
The merger of the units of this D?sseldorf money institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt will create "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trading on the capital markets," we read in the letter, which was made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "set of competences" into the transaction, ensuring long-term returns.
In general, such a merger can be a decisive impulse for further groupings in the sector of state banks.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
Unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose announcement to the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas said during the presentation of the six-month results at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstrass with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which consists of one half of the Landesbank and the other half of the savings banks, appointed the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be a capital market trade or part of it.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that Deka-Bank might merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing of this troupe.
Shortly after the plans for the merger were made public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.
Neither of the other two banks were so close.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks have repeatedly appeared.
Recently, however, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, Gunther Merl, commented negatively on the speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
Independently, however, it seems to be growing a conviction that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the Bavarian Bundestag elections, the connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg could be the first to emerge.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it will gradually lose possible partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would play only second fiddle, despite the fact that it has so far faced the financial crisis much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the connection with WestLB was banned by the Association of Savings Banks and Girobanks Hessen-Thoringen, which holds an 85% stake in Helaba.
At most, Nord LB would be considered.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind, however, are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of state-owned banks has not yet been answered by the German Savings Bank Association.
Everything could also end with the dissolution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the local board of directors also mentions that it is trying to provide a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual folders with Deka-Bank, time will tell.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians"
This is the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger bearded man and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest prove how deep his throat can emit.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, in one bus are exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames, these three buses belong.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, this year alone he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave for the night, following the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus stops quickly and the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will need their strength.
He stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where he takes one more break on the number 8 motorway in front of Munich, as well as many other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes his last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
On the left is the inscription "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" cries Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward so you don't get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out across the space!"
The máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here tonight at exactly 10:30!" You understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as signs on trees, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The weekend with the Italians is known as the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact numbers of visitors are not available; 50,000 are said to be making their way across the Alps and crashing into beer tents, with 10% of all visitors arriving from Italy this weekend.
The ranks of the Munich police will be strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps the national statistics, in which the Italians ahead of the British (about 60 hits) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck stressed that Germany’s banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and also implicated in his claim the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared crisis development.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax-watched finance house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance will go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually spent.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier has been extremely short-term refinancing for long-term projects for which he borrowed money, which is now no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrank by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio fell slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and from certain securities, as well as from the abolition of provisions for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from compensation for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from interest compensation under the Tax Code and for brokering business for group companies, the 16% decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
The former state financier, after his privatization in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for businessmen, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little money in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off of the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "fundamental material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have vaguely let themselves hear.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
It has already been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
Since taking over Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financier of state and infrastructure projects.
It depends more heavily than other institutes on refinancing in the interbank market, as it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, because banks were guarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds per year for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio - about EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely inoperable".
Other sources have said that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now assured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamism and impregnability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue fails, albeit tentatively, to calm the passions.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond rates were well maintained.
While the preferred debt has practically not moved, the rates of secondary bonds are losing more significantly.
This applies in particular to the bonds of the former subsidiary of the German company Wurttemberg Hypo and, logically, to bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Initially, Hypo-Real-Estate bonds looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after a significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be what almost no one now dares to hope for - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that came along with this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This, in particular, will likely prepare long-term creditors with a series of sleepless nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can at least use the capping line to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to the exchange rate returns of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the box bento
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is about to introduce herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to sneeze: the German girl is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from manga. On her new blog about exchange stays she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was tired on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I travel 40 minutes by train to the high school in Tachibana.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine a short meeting with the teacher begins, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I was not yet in school uniform, I put on my mother’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue socks and black leather boots.
So, dressed in this way, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: ‘Sajónara Wo še Sylvana...’ - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was fairly calm, but when the gong came, it literally filled me up.
They talked one over the other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their benches.
My host mother also made me such a lunch box - and this is something different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of fish in tofu batter.
I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Bents in Japanese schools aren't just for lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a bento prepared by hand, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that he will get to know the boy closer during a snack at a break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese one day.
I knew I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a fondness for tradition, customs and customs.
They are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how can we verify that they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing the contributions of well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to deal with a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter an impassable terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists judge to be comparable to subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are, and being able to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the linguistic nature of a person: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we can exclude animals.
But even if language consciousness did not matter, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is impossible to even measure itself, due to the special hardware, to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, we are faced with great problems.
Most of my inferences relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be either.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of a defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex that distinguish primates, especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because through words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the sensations perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I can't argue with that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way: But how can it be verified, Pankseep goes on to say, that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the sameness of experience.
It is true that neural comparisons move us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, while cockroaches do not have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proved in man: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as in rats I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, for I do not know if they exist.
It can be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be led directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to hold the European Cup together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfillment of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts lag behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Federation.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Association was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by an independent trustee, Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there was "a serious danger that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that this step will not hurt the preparations for the 2012 European Championship."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced relegation last season due to manipulations alone, eventually even having to be quickly moved to the beginning of the league.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to do a commercial for a new movie, talked about private matters in an interview - and now she's having issues with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has referred to her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as a marriage-breaker.
He rages and strikes back.
A belated war of roses between ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are having a nasty feud - in front of the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - he tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: It's "crazy," the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and edits it."
In addition, it is “regrettable” that Jack’s 16-year-old son is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce means for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on cheating: "My life goes on anyway.

Prices of flights and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent, according to one recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analyzed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, it found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already gone down.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
The reason for this trend is the weak exchange rate of the dollar, which caused the "decreasing appetite of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In Norway, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent to set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights cost up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, Economy Class fares fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class fares, the changes were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell even by half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement that liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player joined the game late and failed with a stick-in-ball.
His report was precisely worded and came out of his mouth persuasively.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jolo.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed".
The Hamburgers owe 1:0 (1:0) to the head of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbašans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live-updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as the best.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly but surely not yet able to flash.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the collapse of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in a single day in its history.
Later, Dow gained some weight again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer showed a 5 percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
At this point, the worst was American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs shares are down almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock options of financial companies, which could be reimbursed if the exchange rate develops favourably, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
Billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downwards and withdraws the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones Index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange-rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
Despite the rescue action by the federal government and private banks, the shares of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of their value, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000 point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street trading day began with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that the US government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to revive financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, with the Senate expected to vote on Oct. 1.
Other European stock exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.

Dark Matter Affects Space Probe Flight
For years, scientists have been struggling with a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which are about to freeze, now threaten to kill her in the cold.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years: the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravity slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physics trick just like the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in the speed.
Probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was christened by an anomaly of a gravity slingshot.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, the presence of which in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
“Dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about ten years.
It is an apparent gravitational force whose effects on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, one fifth of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free.
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the Italian foreign minister said the kidnapped tourists were once again at large.
Kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shootout before the release, six hijackers were reportedly killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said: “Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are now verifying their health status," Frattini said.
According to a report on Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert appear to be already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the worker said.
He said it was "just a matter of taking the hostages" when "this surprise" suddenly came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot dead six hijackers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German intermediaries, said that the release of the hostages was prolonged because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by stepfather 'leads to suicide'
Several years of abuse by a stepfather led a woman to kill herself was heard in court.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle regularly when she was between the ages of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
It was also said in court that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was reported in court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial portion of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse being perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends told Ms. Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she had "given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She's thought to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more horrifying is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have come to trial at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously, otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged.
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train at Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offense against the law, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the officer on the grounds of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
The British credit unions may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds of debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided GBP 14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be repaid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Association of Credit Unions (BSA), said it was "humiliating" that the credit unions and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime will be repaid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan Fund for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved judiciously... now have to pay back some of the accounts of those institutions which were far from being so judicious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the pawn shops should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the debt will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the pawn shops will have to find 81 million pounds to repay the interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the trade association of credit unions, told the BBC he was convinced it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the boom of the housing market now have to pay back some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent."
According to the BSA, no reservists have fallen since 1945 when they appeared.
"We will need to explore all aspects of this issue over the next few weeks to see what the options are to protect credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are shareholder-less, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect price increases in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-prime minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid to be released on bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail over allegations that she had extorted over fifty million takas (US$729,700) from a certain businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalid Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release if she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an examination released on an affidavit," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal the order of the High Court."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December election.
A senior official of the People's League said Sheikh Hasina was due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took power, but she was released from prison in June so she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Ziya both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent polio vaccination because of Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for safety reasons she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A U.N. spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB has lost a lawsuit to review a competition commission decision that ordered the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB’s Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered it to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9 % to below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's share was hampering competition and giving the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a store that, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB raised doubts about ITV's independence, and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportionate - primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of the American Lawyers Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report of the affair drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in order to thwart justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their functions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said lawyers had been dismissed due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that dismissed attorneys were rated no worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter deception made against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for dismissals and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he was "mainly responsible" for the layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position, and was "not remarkably involved" in the events.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held the charts for about nine years and sold over forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated on due to an irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscuring streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roadways, some famous, others only utility.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten meters and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There are no street signs.
In an ordinary atlas, it is practically invisible.
Still, he has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants Extra Place to re-palace and create a cleaner passage to the stores and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by the truncated alleyway simply because it was one of the last remnants from before the block was ennobled.
However, the city’s Building Protection and Development Authority, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community's land committee, representatives of the municipal authority and Avalon Bay company outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of Municipal Community 3, the committee favors a variant where the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be filed next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"There could be suggestions for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-palace the small street and set up seating, several of which would be used by the café, whose interest in leasing the space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main intention is to repair this derelict alleyway and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was suggested by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Preservation of Buildings, said the city had indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop rather than manage the property.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about ennobling the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, albeit a meagre one, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), posted a portion of the Extra Place story from the Let's Talk About the City series that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and battered windows, where a week-old newspaper runs through the ditches."
With a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same last night.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, which now houses an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A few passers-by said he rarely thinks about Extra Place, but suggested that he might need a boost.
In contrast, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the impressiveness of the aisle in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, damp, and hideous."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this issue of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates’ attitudes to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools."
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama’s education agenda is proof of that.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's education agenda particularly advocates, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for those still learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in narrowing performance gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
In most cases, the students of this school are Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth graders have reached the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an unexcused approach.
Further, and Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach for those still learning English is "complete immersion."
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would walk into a classroom and not know which one it was."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-taught students should look like?
The results the school achieves should take this question for granted, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association has been a longtime advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure Obama's prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by stating that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to wipe out performance gaps, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic fears
Oil prices plummeted on Monday amid fears that the U.S. plan to bail out financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell by as much as 7 percent in morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 a barrel.
Since Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, then jumped again on a wave of massive financial market uncertainty.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the congressional presidency announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of progressing decay, the government announced that Citigroup would acquire the banking arm of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy "show themselves unable to revive the mood in the market".
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for the global stock, interest rate and exchange rate markets has been highly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the American virus will spread around the world, and especially to China."
Analysts at the bank cut their expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets over the past eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned the scoreless game into a graceful ride.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grim clouds above them with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfecting the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved miles forward.
Favre sent Coles out in this quarter for another two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the halftime game.
"It wasn't anything special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
“He’s a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought.”
While Favre and Coles were pitching, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, thus gaining a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter with no answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
The rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he overtook by 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed an Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was worried - perhaps too alarmed in hindsight - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer runs, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in a time of 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break seemed to be more of a wake-up call than a hold-up.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago I started again and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He has also been criticized - mainly in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally evading the world's marathon rushes, relying on drivers as if it were a track race, and setting world records above a sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's immense running qualities.
Maintained at the pace of the four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie's half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the finish, Gebreselassie made his last run and escaped Kwambai, who then ran in second place in 2:05:36 time, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the excellent year ended with the seventh fastest time in the history of 2:19:19 Irina Mikitienkova, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitienko won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games due to what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, improving her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan female runners escape to a big lead and then dragged them down after about 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Life in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and rigor of African-American life comes alive.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state, and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guacamole, two schools, and no prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Eatonville Festival to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a sideline, though she made it a stopover for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when black presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama is calling for an open discussion of races, many locals remain wary of foreign perspectives.
“We’re paying close attention to how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city’s oldest parish.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes lauded - that emerged from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the people here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through cordial books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide turned the city a short distance into Route 17, which leads through the often-passed center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big drumbeat in both life and literature, Hurston led the reader to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained yards and pitches, which is always looked after by Howard Miller, though he cannot read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything at all that fits into a one-hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This clearly wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn’t a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the chorus of Johnson's Girls, who Hurston made immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chippy eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today is proud of its dignified dress code.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many sneered.
"People have always liked to see Zoroa," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings at Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood either its importance to the world or its legacy," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
Orlando's sprawl has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing struggle brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“We actually had a woman who was killed.
They threw a melon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown v. Education Chamber case to be "insulting rather than glorifying to my race."
Residents now say that desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the youth's courage.
"Black kids were used to hugging -- I remember that -- you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, the celebrated biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves in bookstores, re-entering it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
The former neighbors of the Hurstons now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five currents of the highway have resurrected, you would say directly detonated, a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-towners such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending church here in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a sunken alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He is now 90% black.)
Strangers who come to seek the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain things - such as murals in Eatonville's oldest church, which were painted by whites and which depict blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And just as the Hurston Festival has grown, so has domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and all, but no better, no worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, echoes a sincere love for the village as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just drive through here, think, 'Well, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluent financial
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glazed bee hive of offices above their heads, the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York City each day have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers still rattle metal carts on sidewalks and carry muffin pancakes to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the balances on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it's still not possible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed the task to coincide with the late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in line there.
Not in front of the cashier's windows to pick up or store cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They collected money from so-called thrifts (a bit like building societies), money unions and those types of savings banks whose branches operate only in one state and which claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to catch a rescue buyer.
The office and shop workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned to be fluent in finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated chief executive Dick Fuld with such familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed housekeeper of my apartment building, about 50 years old, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang attend a demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that depict mosques crossed with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were badly damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was connected to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration as the Muslim month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering a round of soul-searching after a right-wing slump in yesterday's parliamentary election.
Both far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, waged a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and even expressed his opposition to meals that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police approved the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court service said: "On Thursday 25 September, in Ashford's lowest criminal court, Kent police asked for a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadda from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad as required by his sex offender record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also give the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he fails to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police announced they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone stay in the UK because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for Kent police, and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders to minimise any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order ordering him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A Interior Ministry source said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master off-stage."
No heels, no frills, no costumes.
Only the essences of the great flamenco masters, detached from the focus on interpretation - only then will I achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other - a man.
Inseparable, apart from privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a glance or a passionate gesticulation of hands that are carefree because they are not going to get on the scene.
In "Flamenco-people", the German Gunther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer creates a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Months of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca) program, "reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists, and dancers on a board camera in 1997.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
Applying different stylistic means is at odds with the classical basis of the film and gives it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What draws the audience away is not the action of the dance, singing or playing itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and soon there will be a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
A passion for portraiture led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating it on "Portraits of Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "taking pictures of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a while, whether for a long time or just a short one - that's my passion.
I think that in photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or clashes with people, personalities they sometimes do not even know, or they give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits entitled "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fotómata in 20 de la Mata street, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he is writing is "boldness"
Set in an environment he doesn’t yet know, Mario Vargas Llosa is about to embark on a new project: a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for 20 years and travelled the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him "is presumptuous", and that "everything indicates that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I would not do it, but I will do it and I believe that I will finish it someday," he concluded his contribution at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which in four days he saw in the city of the aqueduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the word festival and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for most popular writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the theater with Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a devoted audience in front of him, to whom an hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a good dose of humor recalled how his original "incredible adventure" from "the pleasure of an avid reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" spawned a literary mission; how he recollects the
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience" - emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that according to him "it affects people" and "makes them try to go out of line", and urged the writer not to "be subject to their own responsibilities"
Due to climatology loses the festival in Pozoblanco - missing spears
The lance performance, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performers' announcement that the square's surface was not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavourable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second planned bullfights.
During these, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanco.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was carried on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear blows for greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bullring of Los Llanos unsalted.
In the second round of hard work without a single breath, he earned harsh criticism from the majority of the audience.
They got out of control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish.
Ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza road control in the municipality of Armión (Álava).
Officers stop two people in a van and they drive away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hash, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior, they were chased and detained by one of the people driving in the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit conducted a roadside inspection of the N-1 in places where it crosses the border of the municipal district of Armión.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, sped up and ran away.
The members of the car immediately began to chase, when the car stopped a few kilometers further on the road, at that moment both passengers jumped up and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hash, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed when they inspected an Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "crushed" and did not agree with the data contained in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the confiscated drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department to handle the proper formalities before proceeding to further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to pull out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "took a sharp step on the gas, moved forwards and backwards in a loud rumble, and tried to leave the parking space - she turned on her sunglasses several times while reversing".
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after she stopped on a nearby highway and stepped out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, she found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the roadway.
"She looked disoriented", so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were subsequently ruled out, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was apparent to the officers at first glance".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in Silva case
The head of the IU and MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of former councillor of the Youth and Sport Department of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will depend on the party's regional association.
"I'm too federalist for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares hinted at the negotiations the party will have to take in relation to a former member of Seville's city council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of Silva's illegal conduct investigation: "The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garcia in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by episodes from Benito Pérez Galdós's national past, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "render the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
The May Blood with over two and a half hours of footage will be released this Friday, and a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdós's work, José Luis Garcia claims that he fulfilled a "child's dream" by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to shoot a film for the bicentenary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot will be based on the Episodes of the National Past.
The $15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid has fully contributed, represents a “unique opportunity” for Garcia to create an environment with scenes and costumes matching the image of “a Spain in turmoil that was mistaken for a leader that could be fought for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support given to the films Ala triste or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the amount of May Blood - and could not make some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he has worked almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as he is normally used to - on stage together with actors with whom he usually tries before filming and which he does not choose by casting, because it seems "humiliating" to him and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, going to theaters and cinemas".
Many of the actors he chose for May Blood appear in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larracaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three nominees representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to emerge".
There are no awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re only working for a living, so you’re willing to make one more movie,” Garcia said.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of a Catalan (Floren - Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of an Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabele Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, but about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythms.
So the "butterfly dance" evoked a guajiru or "snake dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic," she says.
The performance involves the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Leado, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
In the performance, he also counts on the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artists, who are prima dons with everything".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for its time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at one time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The performance starts today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Diary of a Newly Married" also closes the triennial
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the newly married" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the site where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to celebrate their fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize's death.
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York City, the repair of the Nobel Museum House, and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of the Sun", which was opened in May this year, and after touring the various Andalusian provinces, should move to the schedule, according to the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of "The Diary of a Freshly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's greatest Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like it that much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intention" and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, reveals his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get the Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a man for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford in tears, “my life and my lands have been made better by him.”
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and homeland died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when America’s self-esteem is at its lowest, when it is desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those worth admiring - you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from an anti-drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the first-born son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-made food and organic food.
A treasure trove for a country that has taken a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal eating culture.
A tumultuous wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman did these days - he prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But fortunately, they are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be in heaven with pride that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and his admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The Imperfect Races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a mass of nonsense that if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense begins with picking up a racing number, for which one has to start early.
This does not seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up a number first (the first nonsense, to go there just for that) and (after standing up the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had an S-size T-shirt (the second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, that's small compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the queue lasted over 15 minutes, he still had to hand in his backpack.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was prolonged by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general revolt and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not show the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone had asked me for a perfect race, I wouldn’t have thought of this one.
So I think we're just going to have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new AI-like system of image recognition and human interaction - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company's premises) and perceiving what they hear in conversation.
Thanks to the camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
They can also sort people by conversational group.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is going to see someone and tells her that she will be taken care of in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Exquisite.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had just the bare necessities, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover like thunder, considering that Microsoft version since version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I became one of those who leaned towards the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time every day on the Internet than around the windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine begging them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed to be delayed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count to 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather", and in addition, it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the enumeration of his life roles, we can delve into the image of a typical muscular man with a pointed mustache, lifting weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, snug and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, for its crass name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to the sport, because, as the legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost unrecognizable) Belgian flag, which the models of the most emblematic tank tops have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
She also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be a father does not worry me."
Her great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new work in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than just having some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in a promotional event held at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's warm and timid, and she'll win you over.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second edition of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a difficult day, but also an exciting one.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950s and 1960s, and we've drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to wander around the city and watch women walking around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from a young age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother’s house, walk around in my aunt’s closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep my clothes on.
You know, we dancers take pride in how adjusted we are to feel at our lessons and rehearsals looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 years old recently, did you have a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than ever, 30 years old.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I do what I want from a young age, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don't worry about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are now a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing them in cinemas.
I come from the theater world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can’t do that.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to take part in a fundraiser for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we were showing - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - were auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are many things being said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of the women of the Third World, I will do what is necessary.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install in his car a system that will prevent him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, therefore drivers will also have to take a course in traffic re-education.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the FITSA Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety will also be involved in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists accused of drunk driving more than once will get back behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher than permitted concentration of alcohol is recorded.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study to this effect in the USA in 2007 showed that infractions were reduced by 65% in the first year after introduction for vehicles equipped with this equipment.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its introduction, since the legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions, however, requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been trialled in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force aircraft arrived at the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D.F., with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced to close their eyes with their hand in order to see the follow-up couple getting out of the plane.
Underneath the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver in the street if he knew that a Spanish prince and a princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, she's not gonna be able to get to the airport at that time to recruit people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
The Mexican press, however, is well aware of who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marines ready to fire an honorable volley.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue, and the princess, very sparingly dressed and with her hair open, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D. F..
Before they go to the hall, where official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose casually for them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, there is a chatty Mexican TV reporter waiting for them.
The Best Subsidized Fashion Award
There is probably no better place in the world for a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no better designer and bonviva than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation to new talent in the fashion industry.
The price is subsidized by the amount of 300 000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, looked at her designs yesterday in the Manga window on Paris’s Haussmann No. 54 and almost wept with emotion.
Sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and was just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentino for taking the chair of the jury, caused us to have a sumptuous dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
The festively decorated chair table by Mango looked even more amazing next to Chagall’s most outstanding works.
With her heart broken over the recent death of her brother, Nati put on the ELAH brand’s clothes and jewels, which held her breath, and hung up on her son Luis, a nearly two-meter-long elegan, to accompany Valentino at the head of the table for a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, having both offered them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own-designed trousers and shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera House accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals and, remembering other times, she grabbed one of the bars and hinted "a grand".
Inés Sastre didn’t stay long for a tour of the palace’s other buildings, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh l'l', c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which on September 30th will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hasty rhythm that contemporary life brings.
The office is called Tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of detachment from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no smaller than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, apart from yoga positions, classical massages and “spa” therapy, has gathered on the pages of her book a whole “menu” of possibilities, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Way of Relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "manual" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to stay in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in the body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but it’s actually meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain his arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturna, or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress or flare-ups.
In any case, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and in this way he manifests himself.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the baby too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somniloquy appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything from what happened the next day.
Helpful advice
Don't be him.
It is useless because he is not conscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Keep in mind that if you find yourself feeling very distressed several times in a row, it would be helpful to seek advice or find out what is causing such anxiety in your child.
If there is an understanding of what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming about, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask them their secret at night.
No kidding.
This causes great anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long lean period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-and-blacks created more chances and were able to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were hardly able to assert themselves.
After the captain's first attempt, Kauffmann, who had missed the line by only a hair's length, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain by long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch, leaving only agile Riahi at the point of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well placed to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
Goalkeeper Illhaeusernu, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, he was forced to return to the dressing room after about twelve minutes, leaving his teammates in a state of weakness.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of this and the eleventh from Illhaeusern, who had only withdrawn a little to "concentrate" the defense, no longer caused any major difficulties, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball after much confusion flew very close to the flag.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To face a demonstration by a force of fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistere on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", hoping to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysée Palace, said the president would "talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted a "snail" operation (slow-moving vehicles) in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing nearly 10km of traffic congestion.
Quiberon's recreational port was also blocked, but services in the direction of Belle-Ele were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was opened on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when tyres and pallets were burning at dawn in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before they decide to act.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday how to continue the journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chair of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Currently, non-diesel fishermen pay around 50 cents per litre, but they believe the ship's yield threshold is only reached when diesel is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes all bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 supply forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession looming over the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 units delivered, President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over a period of eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering ceding 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been put over water by U.S. monetary authorities, is considering ceasing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion given to it as a down payment, the Financial Times reported Sunday.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the United States, according to sources close to the negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possible assignment.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmation statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has yet been taken on these transfers, France Télécom continues.
AIG must urgently raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan given to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the risk of being confiscated by the U.S. authorities for 80% of its capital, thus diluting it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq Index with the dominant technology component lost 199.61 points and stabilised at 1,983.73, according to definitive data after the close of trading, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Dejected from the start of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the House of Representatives’ plan to bail out the banks, a plan that was supposed to make it possible to find some stability in the markets again.
With 228 votes against and 205 for the representatives, they refused to provide Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he had requested.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal to the market that it sees Congress not being able to accept a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
“If this project is indeed doomed ... the relay will be handed over to the Fed and other central banks without delay to stave off the crisis, which would further solidify credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
And with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States “every new day brings the downfall of one financial institution.”
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the Wachovia bank's banking activities were organized by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not “only facing the American crisis, but the global crisis,” added an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has soared.
Earnings on 10-year bills fell to 3.632 percent from 3.827 percent on Friday night, while 30-year returns fell to 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins in first televised game
The first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday was followed by a second one, which was to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama had won.
The Republican-Democrat campaign headquarters were not surprised when both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says the Democrat is the winner.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She’s talented,” Bill Clinton said this weekend.
McCain has consistently emphasized his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while also emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, said he was the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, while Obama has," said a Democratic spot this weekend, which reproaches the Republican for not sufficiently taking into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American."
“In the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama told 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina election rally.
He didn't even pronounce words like "middle class" or "working class." The financial meltdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the chasm.
"There could be a decisive turn next week," said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (470 billion) financial aid plan passed by Congress last night, which is heavily unpopular.
"Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even go to the polls: "What good would it be if they did whatever they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian high-ranking officials and a freeze on some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive power.
If any opposition MPs enter parliament, it will be by being appointed rather than elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, will not declare the election valid.
He stresses that turnout seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all sorts of manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there have been elections?" asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
“There was no foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who most suit the regime."
The night was quiet again in October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on the success.
Interview - Blood, which again is certain
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, who were severely shaken after the Contaminated Blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Because of this drama and a wave of public outrage, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate a recommendation not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever lingered in handing over the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee took up this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to manage Québec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec began its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in Quebec’s blood system,” says Dr. Décary.
"The situation was disheartening.
By continuously working to increase the safety of blood products and by constantly working in this area over the years, we have regained public trust," he says, adding proudly that by the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the Quebec population had already trusted Hema-Quebek.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we saw many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Europe," says a woman who has led the company since it was founded in 1998.
“We didn’t know if this disease could spread through the blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, we need to take exclusionary measures.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this episode showed us that adhering to the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in the donor blood the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies, on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the period of deafness that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
One in 12 million people today is at risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone can become infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can safely get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for healing," said Hema-Quebek.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of germs may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by insect stings.
We need to be vigilant at all times,” continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on a sufficient supply.
“The needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Québecs allowed to donate."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, according to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of blood donors are not accepted because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is rampant, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be replenished in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, persuading people to give blood is difficult, especially keeping them and encouraging them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unfettered today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Hema-Québek, who also administers the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously thought to be biomedical waste, is rich in stem-cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to take over 1,000 of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division knockout series yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinals played for the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) victory over the Sounders from Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-sided goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two matches, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will compete against Vancouver’s Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder made up a 3-1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is scheduled to clash with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first offensive trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanec and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged an attack to win Canadian 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists and Kovalev scored one pass in this fourth three-color victory of the six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate raids.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
“I need one more game to feel good.”
"He tried too hard in the first period," Guy Carbonneau said.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's by-election.
"To push back the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party convention in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a kind of picture mill.
On three huge canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Québek from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would call early elections in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
"Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe convention, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation before.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with enormous potential", but did not specify a deadline, the amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: hydropower plants in particular, forests, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's enumeration, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is here", "is in Quebec.
And he is not only with us, but he is in us,” he said, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Québec territory, includes part of the Labrador that Québec has always demanded, the prime minister specified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
“There is one line that has long been unconventional, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again in the name of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, “our vision of the North also needs to be reconsidered in the context of climate change,” he said, referring to the north-west transition that will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that seizing territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
It was launched by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be set".
Moreover, the development of the North should be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as fluently following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the still-shaking topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s joining the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to christen Beauharnois' headquarters on the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded the Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourasse, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," Charest said.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, premiering from 1957 to 1963.
When it came time for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program is packed, especially with the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the Liberals' chief with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to amend the Constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (the Liberal Party of Quebec) particularly demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Québec to appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power in the case of decisions taken in Québec.
On the part of the opposition, Plan North was skeptical in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again drew up the Policy of Development of the North of Québec, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have stayed on today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Fran?ois Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from a holiday today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (o irony) in Harper's cabinet, who dared to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was "shameful" to Canada.
To dishonor a woman who has fought a relentless battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister’s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not brought back its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time when the crimes against him were to take place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association in particular are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can see a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically devastated in the future, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy," a word that Harper flaunts so much and that sounds so hollow from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him at the will of the head of a hitherto minority government (as will be the case after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to spark a "transparent public debate" and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an affront to honor, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver completely ignores this crucial distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to hold a public debate is to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums of money in order to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced fights, after all, often consists in bankrupting the defendants in order to enforce conciliation, which will clog the mouths of the opposing party and, moreover, frighten anyone who would dare to devote himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas and not in the blows with a baton.
Mining companies, therefore, were not enough to open up their books, their documentation, and to initiate a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion, and has vehemently rejected petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate", while simultaneously disdaining the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world only refers to boldly paid attorneys, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak out.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public who support the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is prepared to question Barrick and assess the matter, but based on a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be shut (as part of its prosecution of the "public debate", by the way, Barrick has just filed an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they are to stop using the term...).
Aside from Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct assault on the university’s freedom to explore and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, without exposing themselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit makes it clear that despite what it claims, it has not the slightest desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of unwarranted prosecution.
Operation to Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand Each Other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the conclusion of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that is effective in the markets," Bush administration official Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the ongoing Wall Street crisis,” he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” Gregg said.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have taken off for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors’ minds.
The time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US presidency were invited to negotiate later, and both spoke out in favor of the deal rather than neglecting to express their displeasure at the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the agreement with some measures, especially one aimed at allowing owners to keep their residence, and measures on the salary of the heads of state-sponsored companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the TV waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features that I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to spend and with which it will be possible to move forward.
It is simply unacceptable to choose inaction," he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back dubious receivables and risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis unleashed by the bursting housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprimes, then passed on to other, more widespread forms of lending (PCAAs) and resulted in cash freezes and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The fall of the first draft agreement last week was the fault of Republican MPs.
Ever since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty would only be guaranteed by the government, but would not buy them back, there is a belief that the impasse is over.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, provision was made for the government to be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if, as a result of the program, it had to take losses over a period of five years.
The new plan includes a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its assistance, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which will pay dividends to it in case of profit, and which it will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the confiscation procedures related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of remuneration and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The drafters would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's perfectly obvious that Washington can't hear you," House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett said.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money from taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "Skeptics Committee," presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished economics professors, among them three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to carefully examine which path to take," he said.
At the same time, it has been reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risky loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, ranks among Europe’s top 20 banks and among Europe’s top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government has begun nationalising another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all of Bradford and Bringley’s existing loans, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were real estate loans.
According to its announcement yesterday, branches and accounts of clients of the British bank will be bought by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The Death of a Socially Engaged Icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his trump card, according to others weakness.
Did this American actor break out of narcissism with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unceasing talent that he possessed also distanced him from the power category that begets true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the greasy years of American cinema.
Less grandiose than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was originally Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No over-ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, the whole country was in love with self-made man, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, on television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a race car driver who came second at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sex symbol, despite being a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also go the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show-business, which will forever remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend has caused a vertigo for film lovers, while his big roles rival each other on the black screen of memories.
It is followed by more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams, resurfaces in memory.
From a less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken after his death, which brought Newman into true familiarity in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he will portray the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, bringing him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face that's been wandering for ages, it was him.
There he is again.
In his professional career, various epochs compete with each other.
The young know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few movie legends that left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with its tinsel, pomp, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge of underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too hard.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played the early lovers less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scoundrels and despairers, whose decadence and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, features a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness, to his son Scott, whom he had lost due to an overdose.
In a flurry of honors Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former teammate Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights fighter, ecology, independent film, and an opponent of the decline of Hollywood.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless to us, although at first it was gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for a Hard Childhood.
So rather than let himself be lulled by fame, Newman engaged in society until the very last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us, it was an honor to follow the path of such a clairvoyant and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the trial in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, as a result of which extremely significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local governments - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money raised in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and the commitments were never received by the associations.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were fake.
Forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies to which the invoices are to be produced were decided, among others, on a round trip along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first one was to look at guest houses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices were then produced as part of public tenders published by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, or the Self-Government of the capital city.
Invoices were issued mostly by István Lados with his partner András Úri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip", Lados spotted one cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, this catering facility provided catering for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the company manager, so many people would not fit into this device at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to a foundation called Jobb Juvért, later Egyutt and Harmadik Vezredért, was teeming with formal and content errors.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet there were 130 guests on the invoice.
Fillers of forms with a rich imagination, however, exaggerated this even when they mentioned on the documents a company dedicated also to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office the documents bearing the names Jobb Juvért and Hoppa were not even included.
The head of the company, Gyoz Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown invoices, he immediately knew that these were false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that apart from the formalities, they did not agree that they had accommodated 100 people according to the invoice, as they only have eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Zealous invoice producers did not convince themselves that the sought-after Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign trips, and they foolishly referred to the invoice with cash payment, which also did not coincide with the company’s billing practice, as a service of arranging a trip around Hungary.
In addition, VAT was also included in the document, as revealed in the course of the investigation, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued by Hotel Révf -l -p s. r. o. to the Jobb J -vért Foundation did not agree on the amount of VAT. The company's activity is not subject to the 25 percent VAT, but to the 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was hand-written.
In addition, the "issuers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating at one company, as it turned out thanks to the investigation of the prosecutor's office, as the activity of road transport of goods, which the company based originally on investment advice did not carry out.
Moreover, the fact that the invoices issued by the Egyutt Foundation and the Harmadik Zezredért and the XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesélet and Biztos Pont associations are false was also revealed due to formal deviations - an incorrect invoice format and a false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sporting Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when it was fed by a group from the Fiatal Városért association, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were issued consciously
The second group of invoicers are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik ’vezredért Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s. r. o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy-rfi.
The company Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb J-v-ért and the Atlasz and V-r-sfeny associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, which were not supported by actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was appointed representative of the Ukrainian representative of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company dealing in fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not located.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data established by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to hand over documents related to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlasz, Hoppa and the Egyutt Foundation and Harmadik'vezredért, and he himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció connected to Zuschlag at the request of the co-defendant Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has given organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov had lost 10 percent of the amounts indicated on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the associations Y-Generáció and Sz-vetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals to the public tender of the Mihálye Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the money on the goals outlined in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a house search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to explain everything in detail several times, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with whom the socialists may have made a deal and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He could have been offended, because his requests for easing the conditions of his detention, i.e. for placing him under house arrest, had not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage than they have yet to pay, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this familiar - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Through an experimental auction, the research attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers was betting, the other group participated in a live auction, using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to examine the active brain areas of the subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, an important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively when losing.
This brain region, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, screwing up the price can be explained by an attempt to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a cross-sectional financial survey.
There were three groups bidding against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was that one was highlighted as a win and the other as a loss.
However, members of the group playing "against defeat" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained phenomena observable during auctions of the joys of victory and avoidance of risk.
It was neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories so that we now arrive at a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, including inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways depending on the causative agents of the disease: hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example, infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
In any case, travelers should protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, against virus C the vaccine does not exist.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
After that, jaundice forms on the skin and eye whites, lightened stools and darkens the urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is treated medically.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people who are infected do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells maliciously, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, the implementation of regular writing is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
When detected early, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
If you believe in God, doesn’t it hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God functions as an analgesic that may have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment to study how belief in the god of pain affects a person, the Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examined the human brain in detail, it turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Precisely, the test was performed by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat’s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an anteater, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it does not differ much from the first and gives them a calming impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while watching a religious or general-themed image separately.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were "taken care of" and "calm down, filled with peace."
They felt 12 percent less pain when they saw a religious painting than when they saw Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by using any strongly impressive image even among atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
"We would have to find a picture that would be perceived very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share
On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as they can in the sky; they know where they’ve been on vacation, what examinations they’re taking, and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives, this is still not enough.
But when it comes to skeptics paralleling Orwell’s dark vision, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google’s founders to stick to their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to Google, even after 10 years of world-class work, the company is just at the beginning of being able to work with all the information.
When asked what it would be like in five years' time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would actually be useful for me?" - but software won't be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until it knows enough about users.
Not all Internet users know that during an Internet search, the search words are accurately captured, as well as from which IP address they were searched and to which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep track of their surfing history, can look back at what they have searched for and clicked on, thanks to which, in the long term, they can generate findings tailored to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously mentioned and retained preferences.
“What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I’m doing?” asked users who are worried about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is frightening, the counter-reaction does not cause guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even a rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personality rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example recently was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
But Internet users worried about personality rights may have taken a breather in May when the firm and the EFF e-rights organization successfully proved their point in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained in reference to the strengthening of the adopted law on the protection of children years ago, yet it failed to get lists of search items of individual users, respectively, complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be, by starting to use Google services, exposed to harm, and they stand against it with a revolt, which belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, amassing enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big business, a “corporation that’s on the move,” as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, who is seen as the world’s conquerors because of Windows, even though they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information, and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it just one of the most downgraded keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than cooperation, about deliberately leaving traces behind us and using the communication channels available to us, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can have a profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can be easily linked to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music he listens to, all this can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and he can also write a blog on which his latest pics will automatically appear.
We can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it emerges: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of her mutual friends, can easily figure out who her shabby boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his employee just because he tells his honest opinion about the top management on his blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
One who lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you want to hide something, or at least avoid Google’s monopoly, you have the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search system, but deliberately leaves no traces).
For example, a large number of people do not intentionally register on community sites to avoid being able to find them. Google’s online applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not make us the best possible profile.
Public opinion doesn’t expect Google to show its teeth.
At $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten ad agency investment, and services deployed at an ever-accelerating pace are making life more difficult for not only Microsoft, but many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints causing a disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after raising the fee for the company's kindergarten to double, arbitrarily frequent daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the company's management, all this is lost except for the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, filters out every finding that is good.
One of the company’s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years may sweep the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project to scan and archive books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel Scrooged describes a future with Orwellian reminiscences in which a person can be frighteningly well approached only with the help of data from Google.
Two juveniles helped to remove traces of the double killer from the Star
Two minors were interviewed by police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, according to reasonable suspicions helped to remove traces of this crime, said on Tuesday a spokesman for the High Police Directorate of the county of Borsod.
People have confessed to the activity they were suspected of and are currently being charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both minors, according to the MTI, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
Assisting a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of premeditated multiple homicide for profiteering reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to a store in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man prepared for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to bidders for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the offer has so far been made by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In its comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already recalling the "second September".
We can thank the American president for the global financial disaster, the Roman La Repubblica accuses. The president has not even been able to set up his own party to support that hastily repaid bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at the very moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva-based newspaper Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline to the tumultuous money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither money nor further improvisations will suffice.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
More than 100 billion euros was given to the country’s monetary institutions on Monday alone, according to Der Standard, which said fears that European taxpayers would have to dig deep into their pockets to solve the crisis were becoming increasingly real.
Until now, the European Union has not dealt seriously with the tsunami-like crisis in the old continent.
The "rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros at once, but it would be good if they fixed themselves in which case it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the natural world?
For example, the bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was inspired by the engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic control system, the BR23C, a robotized mini-car equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging," Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technology PR and research and development, explained at the exhibition.
Compound eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C in the field of view of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured in a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to imitate the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective packaging, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, however, this movement cannot be upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotation, acceleration and deceleration was used in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent responses are important, not the ability to process, much less store data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to be stored and reacted to using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not require memory with gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in developing an immediate avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could make its way into production vehicles within a decade.
Another option may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles in the way.
Damn baby already has a name.
The $700 billion economic rescue package bill, which is to be split into several instalments and aims to buy back poor-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended Saturday after midnight U.S. Eastern Time, congressional officials reached an agreement in the days-long $700 billion bailout debate.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said the only thing left is a deal.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken.”
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any particular rise in the stock markets.
The House of Representatives will vote on the draft law in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to establish the program on Monday, after which it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which news of the deal was also welcomed by the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, after all, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend $700 billion to buy bad-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, so that $250 billion will be used immediately after Congress decides on the matter as expected on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy mortgage-backed securities that are assessed as of poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the decision of the president.
The program will be controlled by a special committee, which will also include the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy back poor-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place both within the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The law will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for the funds constituting a cause for concern, for which the companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system of up to $700 billion, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed."
On the contrary, the heads of banks who are in trouble and waiting for state aid can count on the government to reduce the severance pay - which in overseas slang is simply called "golden parachute".
Their payments will be limited only in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry purchases as part of the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of poor-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It should be added that the already existing contracts for gold parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is supposed to be another incentive to participate in the program.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that a legal limitation on CEO remuneration will be in place," said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a share in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank get on their feet, they can also profit from this transaction.
In the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress on how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"That's not what the American people asked us to do, because that's not what taxpayers' dollars will protect," Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur believes that it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who urged the enactment.

Are you going to the U.S. next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Guncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends only on the timely construction of an electronic system of road permits, respectively controls".
She also pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
As of today, the Hungarian Foreign Minister is continuing negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with a star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates from both major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday on their support for the $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a marathon of several days of talks between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on a bank rescue package.
The financial package aimed at reshaping the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently described themselves as the more suitable of the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as the economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some of the advantage and the McCain lead he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama expressed hope at the election rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains sections on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We need to act now, responsibly ... to your jobs, to your savings, to your entire industry, to the stability of the whole economy," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a little bit of a hassle ... but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.”
As stated by the Republican senator, the bill includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the severance pay restrictions for senior officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the president.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.
Print overview of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so CSU's weak result in Bavaria Der Spiegel analyzes.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of seasons is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and therefore for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process, which could be assumed almost exactly ten years, ended the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the Stoiber period.
This is due to the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is eating its parents.
However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more self-confident, more critical, more obstinate.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civil classes; people in the free profession, freelancers, individuals with graduation and university education.
CSU’s support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party leaders are restrained on coalition issues", deals with the confused domestic political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
He wants to talk to the VP.
The VP prohibits the interference of the SP in its internal affairs.
BZ - seems to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to talk to the coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders did not get much insight into their cards.
SP President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the VP.
And the SP wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership there is.
The question of whether he could conceive of a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the VP, as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the course of the Schussel-Molterer was in any case outvoted.
Repetition of this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party so far, these issues must be discussed definitely within the OVP.
The chairman of the BZ-Jorg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on the government's responsibility," Haider said.
We need to break the cycle of poverty and segregation.
In Paris today, the European Equality Summit has begun, hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate in her message to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, which is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs during recruitment, Romani people are being pushed out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, he contributes to the national budget.
"It is the right of the Roma to have their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their under-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union is needed, with an emphasis on the goal and action, in order to speed up the processes of school desegregation immediately, in order to ensure proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to give Romani children the opportunities given to democratic spaces so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens," she said.
Under the banner of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at European and national level.
CSU: Temporary pardon
The fate of the surviving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful election debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Erwin Huber, the leader of the party, and the country’s prime minister, Gunther Beckstein, may still be in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided last October by the party's extraordinary congress.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have let themselves be heard that they will not be sticking to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only had 43.4%.
In Bavaria, the CSU had been a “self-governing” leader for 46 years, producing 18% of Germany’s GDP.
Although conservatives continue to hold high positions in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be Huber’s possible successor, will be a member of a close intelligence team that will start a probe into a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing Free Voter group.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup d’état, entered the House of Commons on the Free Voter list, but then they made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energies on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who until now had been spinning strings from the background, the former prime minister and former chairman of the CSU called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some scathing remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians have also interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country’s success in 2005, somehow stands up together.
Merkel, who has struggled to hide her disappointment over the fiasco, said the loss of CSU positions would not have a negative impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating an injured CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110:0
Not a single member of the opposition was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-strong country has lacked opposition for well over a decade, the opposition grouping together under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had retained the controversial 2006 elections due to a change in the constitution, would for the fourth time renew his presidential mandate, this time "allowing" for a few to appear in parliament.
The ODS has also dropped a previously considered boycott.
Against the background of the opposition’s expectations, economically increasingly dependent on Russia was Belarus, which took credit to mitigate the impact of Russia’s increasingly expensive natural gas imports and also contributed to bringing Beltransgaz, a company owning gas pipelines passing through the country, into Russian hands, wishing to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment assessed as an anti-democrat, it was not allowed to enter.
The release had previously pointed out that the OSCE had placed emphasis on positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign, and not on shortcomings - for example, a ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s lightning report on Monday already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present for the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is a sense of improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it continues to refuse to recognize the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has been considering these two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that a dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though "the power has been afraid to let a single member of the opposition enter the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I can see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider it the right or the most officially supported group of pensioners.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security ‘inducing the silence of the cemetery’ collapses,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politics, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced upon the arrival and departure of staff.
However, from today, this new measure will work against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The anti-lazy news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"Turning doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services" - specifies the minister.
“A new era of accountability and transparency will now open up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta emphasizes.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a joint action with the workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work."
And he will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay-out dynamics," the minister explains, "has doubled in relation to the private sector in the last 8-10 years and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have come together to reject the standards of Brunett's decree in line with the request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration will today introduce figures regarding lower absenteeism due to illness," writes the Consumer Protection Association, "the nation of 'urgent lazy' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
Taru will mainly protest against the exclusion of sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time during which it is possible to check the sick person, in what time range control visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work-related injuries occur in Italy, three people die, and 27 remain permanently disabled.
Inail's figures confirm that there are approximately 1,200 deaths from work-related injuries in 2007.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To once again draw the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic issue, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents set for the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety", confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for the crippled and disabled for work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his deep admiration for the constant joint efforts for safety in the workplace, for the protection of injured workers, for the assistance of the families of the victims and for the complicity of public opinion.
“Naturally, outraged ‘enough’ has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt also the problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance in order to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
"In terms of occupational injury data, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of occupational injury is alarming anyway," said Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We wouldn’t want this ‘reduction effort’ to lead to less attention, because the moment attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little being done in general to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase checks and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training of workers, right from school age."
"More efforts are needed," he added, "in terms of communication and public opinion participation.
But what is needed above all is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon that constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon.”
Mercandelli said it was a “progressive degeneration of the levels of compensation provided for victims at work and the ‘deferral of supportive care’ that the system has been getting to in recent years.”
“The goal, then, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance,” he added, “because the fate of those who injure themselves must not depend on spontaneity or the gift of the legislator from time to time.”
MP3 players accused of putting their hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for extended periods of time and using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today’s announcement by the European Commission, which in an official report circulated in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU’s Committee for the Science of Health Risks that has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri).
"From this scientific view - we read in the notes - it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, weekly for more than an hour a day and keep the device at high volumes, risk permanent hearing loss".
"It worries me that such a large number of young people, who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
“Scientific findings,” he continues, “show clear risks and need to be addressed quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists," concluded the executive official of the European Union, "confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties who raised the problem what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is currently a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that may be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by seeking solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno let the Commission for the future of the capital go free
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Committee for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will compile handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - it wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but merely an effort to have some place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March, the works will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have a precise time limit.
In June we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To the one who accuses the Commission of being useless because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics spills over into everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not cost even the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, in order to allow our city an authentic ascent at the level it urgently needs, and to think with a united spirit about its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Now you know why
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he’s going to get to the top of a nation that has two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are clearly racial attacks and don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; they all say Obama will win and by a big margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
One side of the American mentality will emerge, which has remained stagnant until the very last moment.
Say what you want, we’ll take care of it ourselves in the end, who to tick, Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations, the main weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become Bush’s weakness for most.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Now, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say they had less concern about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the newspaper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change fundamentally as understood by the general public.
There is a clear but complex pessimism pervaded the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives believe that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, which many view as the “killer” of print.
"Economic pressure" reported by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred interviewed journalists admitted to resorting to technology in hopes of "doing something good for their journalism".
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the executives - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has to do with "job security" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose a job within three years are at the national level of 47%.
As for journalists, they move to 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so the question is whether to take it or leave it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month outside of pension and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the argument becomes complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often fall ill within a year.
It is only a question of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRAT
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who requested that he be allowed to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released last week from house arrest, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was manifested a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the $700 billion rescue plan presented by the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, more accommodating to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is on the contrary conservative, hostile to “those from Washington” and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states in the middle part of it.
A soul that has arrogantly demonstrated itself by the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not just in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
Both in the U.S. and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator for phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are becoming more and more intense in the new climate and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of state-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis for the banking of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, are included to the greatest extent.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be global in economic terms, but almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationality seems to be fundamentally out of the question, or that it has little to add: the European Union, which as always is divided between different interests and different national strategies, has given obvious proof and cannot decide on a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get into distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
It also possesses the necessary means and authorizations to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to such an extent.
This new phase, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the growing importance which it attempts to attribute to the last economic progress to one factor closely connected with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the sieve, an increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little immaterial things as water, grain, diesel.
All things, who would have thought, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has many more cards up his sleeve than who is not and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without diesel and without water.
I come to the second news, which, however, predicts a break.
He who speaks of territory, of the state, of government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can take on the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit towards existing leaderships, especially economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that convictions are spreading more and more among the broad masses of the population than their actions are the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral “resistances” or in unexpected changes in collective sentiment in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of the Labour Party in the UK, to the rise of the US Congress.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, have more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is re-strengthening, growing, potentially overblown.
Before this it would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent "mass revolt".
But we certainly can't say that it means keeping our eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The researchers managed to keep a hundred-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, which was invented by a team of researchers, is a development of materials already in existence that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The base of the glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti», explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide a perfect fit.
Tests carried out on different materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time "it simply peels off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes yet.
Also, the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to researching new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists introduced microfiber-shaped glue like hair that cleans itself from dust by moving across the surface to still maintain perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the gain or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, highlighted the risks of juices both ready-made and fresh, combined with the ingestion of certain drugs, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, raising a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs for their beneficial effects.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of some anti-arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when they take medication, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects attenuated by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative drug tickets you get and if you come across anything unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» emphasized the expert for the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic and political policies.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the implications for United States history, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused a lot of controversy and that has been reproached for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is “an economist of great importance” but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration”.
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is presented to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window will be added other, far more essential, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of your PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transferring electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each co-worker is assigned one color for comments, in order to make identification in the revision phase clearer.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and should present a final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of gratuitousness can be a pull for expansion in households, the Open Office business area is where the package bets a lot, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that tends to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this predicted number can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the best climber’s t-shirt.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer to be positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, as well as him from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall within those taken in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analyses confirm the positive on Cer, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who reported to the Associated Press that he had already reported the result to the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastra and American Cadel Evans, he also won the polka dot top t-shirt of the best climber.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, IS ITALIA RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants transformed itself only in the last house into a priority destination of immigrants" received with resistance.
So they ask in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young man named Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino, and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedetto XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, a union for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost their right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure," explains Sunia's head of studios, Laura Mariani, "in this city, the large demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has spurred a process of price increases that has spread to residents as well."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated sub-leases.
For Sunja, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices through tax revisions.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, it takes about 450 euros per bed, for a single room you pay from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through a median value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vitttoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, they need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt).
We save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally one more anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are abolishing the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closed in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like a blind man, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore, successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centers, as well as in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs and the subsequent extinction of mono-halls in central city zones is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a real cultural crime.
It’s as if we’ve lost a friend, a friend with whom we’ve shared a long journey and a lot of emotions,” says Paradiso, director of New Cinema, a film that won the Tornator Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 20 years ago and told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that it lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed their doors, and the highest bill was paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna ranks first with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, are precisely these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-screens: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
Paolo Protti, president of Anec, said: “It is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous national debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support the sector”.
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing the protoculus between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax breaks for the benefit of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore «and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so many emotions that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The link between politics and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"Mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust municipal office elections to the interests of mafia group Piromalli".
The accusations made by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning due to external cooperation with the mafia organization, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," state prosecutors write, when two local administrations expressed willingness to pay for the consultation to Piromalli's attorney.
“This would allow the mafia group to officially join the city authorities and facilitate the already vast possibilities of control and management of public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are a lot in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate'.
The arrests from this morning follow the arrests from July last year, by which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had received the final hit.
Since the end of April last year, the city council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason being the then-presumed connection between organized crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He screamed over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called then-Deputy Minister of the Interior Marc Minniti to account, accusing him of plotting everything for political reasons, but judges in an arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, revealed "the willingness to shift the claims of an entrepreneur, a representative of some larger group very close, as it is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, and tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy upon which the eyes of giants like Chevron have clung, now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil went down around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
That amount would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
In addition, there are also currents and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that put its money on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," said a spokesman for a company linked to the United States oil giant in the economic daily newspaper The Wall Street Journal, "and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering involves obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, are showing increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys that are connected to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy comes ashore through submarine cables.
For the time being, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
By contrast, Verdant Power is already producing power for the shopping mall and parking lot by using six subsea turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during high tide and low tide causes the turbines to rotate, feeding the generator with this rotational movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorizations because of the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this time deserves the potential of the tides, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
States like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in tidal energy in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million by 2009.
