Parliament does not support Tymoshenko’s liberating amendment
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the paragraph under which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which would open the way to the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to commute the sentences for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as a political vendetta of the regime, and the suspicion of bias in the court has also provoked the process in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 from the Criminal Code, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes were needed to approve it.
The Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has subscribed to the customary law of sharia and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as theft is punished with a severed hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith are awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of the person of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters have taken gratitude from the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse for them is that from their point of view the NATO airstrikes were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when it comes to looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
Thus, the problem of expelling the "Crusaders" is eliminated by the locals.
But will they have Libyan black gold without the oil company’s occupation?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless the sharia law forbids us to do so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated between quarters, Germany and France are growing.
The stock market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries were adjusting data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France said that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter.
Quarter-on-quarter, however, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the CZSO, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated year-on-year.
According to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The euro area and European Union economies grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Germany says the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro won 1:0 and celebrates progress for 200 million
The football team has mastered the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football with a big portion of luck in the second half defended a luxury lead from the domestic rematch and again will not be missing at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress of the match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the home defeat in the final, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček, the Czech national team won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The Montenegrins did not come under pressure until the second half due to the precise defence of the Czech whole.
The losers of the match became Damjanovic with Vučič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of about 200 million crowns will be added to the cash register of domestic football.
Since the first few minutes, a lot of football has been played.
Both teams had a hard time getting involved in the combination and were mostly played around the half-line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, as the Czech defence was precisely averted by the long kicks for defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express support for their country’s nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the facility at noon on Tuesday and then called for the deaths of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran appears to have continued its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then shouted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said, in addition to the Isfahan center, the target would be a facility in Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of children obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of a person the environment in which he grows up and the patterns with which he is surrounded.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had dinner the day before a research related to an awareness event called Obesity is no more than a coincidence than 19 percent of the obese.
Fatty families are also not used to sports, which is true for most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the event Obesity is not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from grades 4 to 8 have been involved in the project.
Eating right and getting enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“For example, only half of those surveyed said they eat five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and evening sausages
Experts point out that both relative details, such as regular family breakfast times, are essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding out that in ten households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of children regularly participate in sports, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diet according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"Apparently, the popularity of sweet lemons is alarming," the survey said in its final report.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
Adherence to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"The control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the awareness lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project's results state.
For example, sweet lemonades were prominent, where more children would begin to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to mark poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained a little that there was already a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trodden".
This time we discussed with the director Alice (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And the vast majority of them are.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boy figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to emphasize the figure in a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or pants do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece made to measure.
You will not regret it, because the perfect fit of clothes is priceless.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, pulls up, sets off at the waist and the like.
In turn, the boy figure can afford to wear clothes with lashing, applications, embroidery or picking.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the homework assignment, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to create two outfits: daytime and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the given personality and the type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of jubilation, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account hyperbole), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the sheets from magazines or search on the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, packed with information about the types of characters, was enriched by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a smart stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you originally want a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also wear it on a bare body, put on pumps and take a picture as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But I appreciated the following advice the most: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jacob.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with what, why, when even in fashion magazines we sometimes see something different.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have many more variants of clothes than can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
That is what we have to take into account when creating an outfit.
That the image and style sometimes makes up half of the success, confirmed us Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (after all, I can do something, the way I look is second-rate).
And if someone has already let us create styling, then we should count on the fact that he will most likely dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than he really has.
Then all you have to do is google and see if the tabloid has written about the fact that a given celebrity has lost weight and so on.
Both Honza and Mario put it to our hearts on Sunday that it is not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to pander, to stand up for your opinion.
“When a manager orders you to sort through her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can’t throw out the whole closet and say, for God’s sake, that’s terrible.”
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what the so-called "place" or bag for the place must contain.
It’s the one that you fasten around your waist and you have all the necessary props with you.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, hair roller or closing pins, there are also nylon thread (with it the stylist helps when taking photos of products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which we fasten the back of clothes, if it is larger (pin or other clamp are not allowed, they would damage the clothes), or sew.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly catch shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
Do not touch the shoes with scissors, so that they do not accidentally damage.
So you really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that it is not really a walk in the park, no matter who says what.
Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Reviews
The originally carefree ride turns into a routine morning commute due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
The ambition has been largely fulfilled, but it is of no use if no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, had high expectations for the release.
He promised to move the long-running racing series Need for Speed in a new direction, and from the playable examples it seemed like a game that would not be only in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious how the inserted passages will turn out, in which the main character will get out of the car and run on his own.
However, as is usual with the NFS series, many are in the end a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So they are not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
Get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous works of the series.
So it's nothing world-shattering.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains looks very pleasant visually.
From time to time, the race is filled with an unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be overwhelmed by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well seeded behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to pass the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up again (classic fight with stopwatches) and then you are waiting for a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, even the police will get involved, making all your efforts even more unpleasant.
New is the passage outside the car.
It's more about such interactive animations, when Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him in this by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it ranks among the elements that diversify the game.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, it is definitely not who knows anymore, but it can not be said that it is a negative.
If you’re looking for a realistic simulation, you’ll need to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing still suits the model quite well, although we could find a better one in the competition.
So far so good.
Problems begin to arise after a while.
Unlike the road model, the model is no longer in good condition.
We do not expect it to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before almost any impact on any object, then everything is probably not quite right.
Typically, with close overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other lightly, but other times in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even to attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not matter, but it will tune you up reliably.
Restarts are designed in such a way that if you break down or drive far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last stop on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
This is more of an aid in case something goes wrong than you can rely on them.
Sometimes, however, even restarts do not help, they are solved only by the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big problem with this game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you will simply not fit into them.
Other times you will meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see an opponent pass easily between two oncoming cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around them or slow them down.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "calculated" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will come across several places where, again, regardless of time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
At the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there in front of you, apparently, at any cost.
When it is in front of you, it makes your view of the oncoming cars worse, so you will probably spread out a few times at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably disgust you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally do not have time to watch where what flies.
And it doesn’t really matter if it’s a concept with fifty unique tracks, sorting the races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to watch out for gas pumps near the roads, because you can change the car there, although in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American roadblocks on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
To get a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected to the online Autolog function, which compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the more difficult to understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (be) where you will drive it in the dark on the tracks (be).
On the tachometer you flash numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (let it be) and in this comes a metro set from the back and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days of discussions about whether no one really thought a bit about creating the game, or whether the authors consider us to be such a big idiot.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies especially to a crash with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would not be useful for you anyway.
The sound is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest possible range of a rather younger audience, a soundtrack from the category "every dog different village" was created, but it can be assumed that for the sake of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game.
Need for Speed: The Run is so good.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is definitely good, but be prepared for the fact that the mistakes will smack you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the European Union Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly upset the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To what extent she takes her motto "Comprehensively and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could envy her.
Vicenová also commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was indistinct, that he was a grey official, that he could not play any role, and I have to say that everyone was out of breath, that he played the role very well."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unifying and making the EU's policy towards countries such as China or India more readable.
No one wants to ban mermaids.
Vicenová also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, will live and will live on in the near future.
The Czech Presidency last year was a success.
The Czechs have solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was a big negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is becoming much more complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe in a comprehensible way".
"I really don't like nasty shortcuts, foreign words, slang that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that in Brussels we don’t really invent curvy or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that we really have to be banned from cheesecakes?”
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says: 'Hey, what are you guys doing there, what about your Visegrad four?' and he doesn't look excited about it at all."
In the future, Vicenová said, the EU is mainly waiting for new tough rules for the budgetary policies of member states.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
“We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those that don't want to stand by."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová said.
In this respect, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues that have an impact on the entire Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins His Second Century
If someone were looking for the word that most accurately expresses IBM's strategy, the closest would probably be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation for this long-term commitment was laid by the company’s first CEO, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking is a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
A sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance from an employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM also has a long-term customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company was a genius in talent extraction - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will be headed by a woman - Virginia Rometty - next year.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years, and is still the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
It’s no wonder that there are almost half a million people working in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, told the Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is called because of its logo in the United States - in a hundred years has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, bar code and floppy disk.
IBM, with roughly $220 billion, has become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations fit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don’t work, leave them.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM sales are mostly services, about a fifth of them are software and hardware.
In 1990, with more than half the share, it was the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth $15 billion, during which time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM’s share price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and IBM’s net profit has continued to rise.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything, but not its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally with the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was the merger of four companies, the history of which dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous "stickers," i.e. the clocks recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, sales doubled to $9 million and the company began to expand to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that his son, Thomas Watson Jr., succeeded him after nearly forty years in the boss’s chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM people and computers helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic PC that set the computer standard at the time, the IBM 5150, came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has paid off over the past three years for IBM is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in previously unplanned areas and improve the situation in, for example, transport or city administration.
For the business area, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history at home.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Headquartered in Prague, Central and Eastern Europe, there is also a world-class voice recognition research team.
The story of an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, I don't want that donkey anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she doesn’t want to wait and has set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová gave Bartošová asylum in her home in the summer, she probably did not even dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, made peace with her husband's relationship, and now even bid him farewell forever.
He doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář and Bartošová ever break up, he won’t be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will banish him."
"But she will live to see him, not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she has already separated from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina closed the back door for him is not a problem.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm going to be with Iveta and I'm not going to change that."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I shop."
“Darina and I have a very normal conversation, except we don’t share a bed,” said Lightning.
If she finds a new love, she won’t be able to stop it.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where he goes, who he goes with, or if he has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility,” Josef concluded.
The Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female bad habits, as a rule, they are all very quickly thrown out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where are listed a few female bad habits that can perfectly pump men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Do you like to shop and bulk in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, who would resist just strolling around clothing stores, looking for well-fitting uppers and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constantly Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Do these words remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you are one of those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, wiping the tiles, wiping the dust, scrubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a clean tile with a dirty foot, children for soiling a scuffed sink and plastering a glazed living wall that you have put so much work into polishing?
In the event that you suffer from just this "deviation", try to remember that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not be in the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Peanuts
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
“Are you going to wear those socks tomorrow?”
"Wet wipes don't belong on the floor."
If you dig into your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to poke them so hard...
Defamation, gossiping
For some women, there are also slanders, gossips, but also insulting and conspiring against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us releases a little harmless gossip or gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it's for all women.
The opposite, however, are the gossips of the coarsest grain, which like and often gossip, perhaps everyone despises and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female working team.
Jagr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jagr participated in Monday's NHL game by two assists to Philadelphia's 5:3 win on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match, benefited from the review of the 39-year-old star in both cases.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," explained Jagr, after whose event Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, the team’s second strike had a Czech mark.
Voráček scored behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in weakening by home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored a third goal, then his shot was fused into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he is definitely among the top three," Jagr said.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
"I'm happy for you."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina also made the match a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who made it out of the penalty shootout, getting on the difference of one wicket.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended with a two-on-one renumbering.
"He did a great job in our Pronger zone."
"He punctured the disc, I picked up speed, and (Read) drove to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play a match against Buffalo, but withdrew in the second period due to an injury to his upper body.
The Candiens lost the two-wicket lead and lost after a 2-3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids was not turned by Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was mortified by the extensive sickle of the back row, with the match only being played to five defenders.
"It's bad."
“We played with only one player, the rest were young.
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The alternation after the alternation came down on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of P. K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg hits to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold mostly only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both by the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand up to the queue overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
However, by far most often the Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which the Czechs took and this custom survives to this day.
Travel of Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right at the beginning of the 1990s, the visa requirement for neighboring Western European countries was lifted, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a while.
For example, in Paris, tours of Czechs slept in tents in parks, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guest house.
A typical feature of traveling Czechs at this time was bringing their own food, cans, sausages, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to finally buy the Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and average wages increased, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, tour operators have started to regularly prepare tours by charter flights since 1997, which has made air tours incredibly cheaper due to the possibility of contracting quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first ever direct charter flight to the exotic was sent from the Czech Republic to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters have been flying with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
At present, exotic countries are visited by about 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States revoked visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in history, they spent more than CZK 15,000 per person for one foreign holiday, including costs at the place of stay.
The General Assembly is to find the chairman, but again threatens to stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and Ivan Hašek’s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) is at risk of not being known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement as to which electoral procedure will be followed.
There will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and on his departure called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead the football in the future.
But in the post-Hašek era, football slipped back to the feuds between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was announced on 16 September, when the new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a way of choosing.
There was also no consensus as to who has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives, or even officials authorized by the power of attorney.
At this single point, there has been a partial agreement, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
However, there are still disagreements over the electoral process.
Nor has the Executive Committee been too clear about the situation, which does not deal with anything else at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to follow the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the model proposed by the statute, in the third round, the candidate who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to make a concession to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage add-on.
"But this would then lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral rules determined by the statutes suit Pelt the most.
"I wish to be elected according to the Statutes at most."
"So that they do not make up some substitute nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new president will be known and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm down today's progress of the national team at the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," said Jablonec, who has the most experience in managing football at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divisive."
"It is not among people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adjust the regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete by the end of the match.
The aviation special, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not fly out of Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, and a replacement variant was sought to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage rematch.
In the end, a crucial meeting at the ministerial level may take place, which may take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to bring the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He’s fighting for the presidency because he doesn’t see a candidate.
If the head of football players in Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, had seen before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even applied for the top position.
"If a good candidate exists, I will fight for him and I will not vote."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of the elections, from heading to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins, he would only stay in the role of chairman until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected with football.
"I've spoken to some of the people who would come into consideration."
“It was crazy for me when some people said that at the moment they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.
“I would like to change that view,” he said.
Paclík is now most concerned about Pelt’s association with the chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta in the chair.
"If he had won, the status quo would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a proficient businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name was heard years ago in wiretaps during the investigation of the corruption affair, but from which Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what kind of prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes a look at his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman".
However, if Paclík were to win Thursday’s election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is also thinking the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go."
“He has great abilities.”
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But he couldn't manage the association as a manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September attracted much attention by being behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
He said he would take the lead in the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated its premier league triumph in May.
"I have the power to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to strengthen the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new president should be doing."
"If there is a tax on gambling, as declared by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they must tell us where the money will go," he said.
Paclík does not take his connection with the Pilsen club as a burden, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "trans-party".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague’s Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I do not see the point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club to someone hypocritically and returning there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would eliminate the electoral stalemate
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairman Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR would have new statutes, which would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
Jablonec's official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of today's football team.
Before the September election, Pelta promised to focus on representation and fundraising in the event of an election.
He decided to go at the last minute before the last general meeting, so a two-month postponement could be useful to him to defend his ideas about football management and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time someone led the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That’s why he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek is behind the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
“If they didn’t allow different interpretations, we’ve had a chairman since September,” Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a decoy for delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing that we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he’s not trying to beat his opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's had some success."
"But his attacks were undignified and many people were caught off guard by the way of the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelta, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced back in September.
His most powerful weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a football box.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately go into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure that we have enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his coming to the forefront of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would have to first get acquainted with the content of individual employees," he said, referring to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long lack of power.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that on Thursday delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily.
"If the only point of contention is how to vote in the third round, then we can move on."
“Football needs credibility, and the only way to gain that credibility is to finally have a leader again,” Pelta said in a statement.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would work hard under him
If Jindřich Rajchl, the current vice-chairman, were elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to work hard if he is elected.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I am not saying that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview with Czech News Agency.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute competencies in the executive committee so that each member is focused on a particular area."
“And I’m going to be handing out tough assignments to keep football moving forward a mile in each of these segments.”
"It would probably not make many people happy, because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he reportedly considered not running again.
“I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every move," he explained.
“A lot of people told me not to give up, because then others would give up.”
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by continuing the work he started with Haskell.
"There's been a lot of work done over the past two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have a reverberation in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation on the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him, first of all, there are people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but it's not like I'm taking sides."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl noted.
He also claimed that he would only be president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people try to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would split into the Czech and Moravian part, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he claims Pelt is "disqualified from giving Czech football back its trust", he sees Paclík as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he was elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl says.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the point of view of Ufon, a sumptuous pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after exploring the cities or traveling let their tired feet relax in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the most beautiful is in the water.
When Iris Meder set out on a journey of discovery in the past year and a half, her bathing suit was not to be missed in her luggage.
Lying on the water, she looked up into artistically shaped domes, swam opposite the marble putti (characters of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it to her notebook in an instant, with remarkable details about the way it was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her recently published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing)": People's Swimming Pools in Munich, Historical Palaces of Swimming Pools in the Black Forest, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Journey to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It’s not much of a sport, Meder says, but it’s something else in the water.
The only thing that is annoying is that swimming fans have to be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect nice swimming pools."
Water doubles the architecture.
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a person has a water surface in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything visually doubles: high vault, colorful stove, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases of wellnes - but above all, it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of the swimming pool Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfard - in Jáberny).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can watch the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool of the St. Anton spa - a: In the steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle of the ski resort.
Perhaps the most striking design of the pool awaits the spa guests in Längenfeld: The water park of Etztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three open basins in winter, steam rises while in the background of the mountain, the Oetztal rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Mrs. Meder smell chlorine in the nostrils.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulfur, in the Árpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that he has reached the healing baths.
The smell comes from the healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the spa designed by architect Dušan Jurkovič was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw that the weeds were growing massively between the tiles.
They faced extinction in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already gone through three stages of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to their inception in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite spa resort of the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already a feat to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Commodities Trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg - Hotel
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn, according to one study.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this trade because it is deepening the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of the Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices up, and banks are therefore complicit in the global problem of hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have broken away from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
In contrast to competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to investigate the allegations, saying that no deal "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but also stepped up his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are harming the general welfare today."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, live up to his obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used to place bets on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned about starving people or Deutsche Bank's reputation".
At first glance, Ackermann’s view seems surprising, but it is clear that the head of the group would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board, other than planned, will not move to the supervisory board.
By turning away from questionable agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with it eventually.
One in two would invest in raw materials.
Foodwatch tries to maintain high pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute polled 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments involving food price bets.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Every second would as a result of the survey terminate all investments where money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43% would warn their friends about such a bank, 49% said they would think about terminating their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and emptied.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture at the time for its light and lofty steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus as a key executed by the side building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building, designed after the World Exhibition, was located in Schweizer Garten near Vienna's South Railway Station, renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art saw a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, it is now called "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, including a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed through a vigorous reconstruction with politicians and conservationists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money, and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by a foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be created, and an office building must be built for this.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was an "immensely important place" for him, where he viewed exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it moved to Vienna and changed its use.
In the current reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, using fiberglass reinforced insulating glass, and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings sanitized.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a high-rise Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
The cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument office and a low budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap, and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said that it was difficult with the pavilion that "came here from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "awaken proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because an urban happy coincidence has happened: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City District near the Main Railway Station" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already in talks with the city about a neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a million-dollar package for the winter crisis
The track has a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
The Bild newspaper reported, citing an internal group plan, that it is expected to invest around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is also intended to improve the use of trains and rail networks in extreme weather conditions.
The plan is to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 for snow removal on railway installations and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform by the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after meeting top-level government and industry officials, rail chief Rudiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter as well.
In the previous winter season, the runway had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in dispatching ICE trains
For years now, the railway has also been unable to cope with the need to have ICE train axles inspected by workshops more often when one ICE train at the main railway station in Cologne has been destroyed.
Deutsche Bank fined $1 million in U.S.
After the commotion over boss Josef Ackermann, there are new troubles in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of dollars in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank didn’t have enough problems at home, its past in the US caught up with the giant: The Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in a single settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA’s financial regulator accuses a number of big banks of misleading cooperative banks into buying financial products; they seem to have reduced the risks.
During the crisis, such securities lost a lot of value and plunged banks into the abyss.
"We are pleased to have been able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which is committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodativeness of the two monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for co-operative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer receivables.
The NCUA is trying to recover billions of dollars in damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also turned to other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs over the summer.
These are called mortgage-backed securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal to many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing towards the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to address misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international big banks of putting two US state real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at a disadvantage of about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank is also facing an FHFA lawsuit, with more deals totaling about $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held liable for "substantial losses" without specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Buffett invests heavily in IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM mainly offers services and acquires computer systems for IT-departments of other enterprises.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, it can be called IBM's IT mother rock now "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that IBM didn't know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, which sought even proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers for a long time.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railroad, lubricant manufacturers, or machine builders.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding owns, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Rueck.
The 81-year-old man took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and turned it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world by wise investments.
His way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock exchange opened.
The Big Blue, as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts wouldn't want to join.
Bill Gates is a trusted friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "cell in Zwickau" Turkish media doubt about the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one of Greek origin between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population of Germany, this report was reacted to with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back a specter that has long been thought to be dead: There has been no comparable violence to the right-wing extremist background since the arson attacks in M?lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been doubted.
However, the right-wing extremist network discovered reveals a scale whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
"Is bloody ideology coming to life again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the constitutional protection service, and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany has reacted with prudence: It recalled the weekend of the demonstrations with silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
Several Turkish media outlets are reporting on the site: "Germany's 50th birthday gift" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the issue of the newspaper "Hurriyet" for Germany cannot be taken without making this connection of thought.
"It's starting to smell", is the title of the column by Ahmet K'lahci.
In it, he emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
Most critically discussed in German Internet forums is the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
This is how many present themselves, at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues here so superficially, there will be nothing left for the immigrants but their own defense and armament."
"It's going to be the best self-defense ever."
"On the quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment of the entire network very much depends on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened, is explained by the attacks in Muelln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen incineration site is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and detachment can result in right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made the Turkish side more visible a sense of reciprocity.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was mainly criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Muelln who had survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, Kinkel sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but let himself be replaced by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, in his speech at the ceremony.
It is as if the value of a man is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the local legal order.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German has to straighten it out.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank in July, it became known that he would take on almost equally spectacular new jobs in 2013: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praising Switzerland for both its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS achieved turnover".
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Groebel".
By September, it was clear that things were going to be different.
One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS Board of Directors, Oswald Groebel, not only a well-respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board of directors has also been scalded ever since - and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
He will take over the board in May, not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
He will then take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has once again proven itself worthy of the title of “Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe”.
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest wealth manager in the world - and has been slipping for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed, on one hand, $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it has advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world’s largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time professor of banking at Zurich, says: “I always cited UBS as a model for a good bank for my students at the time.”
"From today's perspective, one wonders: How could I have been so wrong?"
He was wrong greatly.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS properly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who had previously been considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, stepped down.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division squandered Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, some of whom she would have looked up to recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, with President Marcel Ospel, Switzerland's second-highest-paid board, resigning in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS stood due to its flawed investments during the financial crisis before collapsing and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - for it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"We couldn't save UBS one more time," says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and expressed its willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from these deals, including a penalty markup.
This made UBS more or less openly aware that it was facilitating tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in asset management for aiding in tax cuts.
And just as things were calming down again, just as UBS was thought to have recovered, here comes this unfortunate business case: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it is clear: the risk management in investment banking is probably still not working.
"The case of Adoboli probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem with UBS is that it can’t handle risk control.”
Yet it was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers set out a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great possessions: no too great risks, but security for money - from this side, too, the world collapsed again.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprungli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich’s Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores such as Tiffany's can be found here among Switzerland's traditional shops such as the Confectionery Sprongli.
It has been home to Swiss banks for centuries: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The reception hall UBS is entered by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them there are massive leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank a large direction sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
The idea of Swiss banks was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspapers, and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, he also closes deals with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it high profits at first, and then disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Grossbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the biggest rescue in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save a standing big bank from bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of Switzerland's three large banks merged into a large group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and it kept growing.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS were complementary: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in handy with a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who manages the feelings around the stomach, who has gone all the way up from banking science."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives at which Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: To bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to place it completely at the top.
She has already managed a few steps.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the corporate advisers who have been commissioned underline one weakness: In international interest-rate trade, in the bankers' "Fixed Income" speech, there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost her her her existence.
Hungry for growth, they invested both the bank itself and the fund founded by it to hedge risks in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a massive machine that would repackage securities into U.S. mortgages and pass them on, but also keep the risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says banking expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, how deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejection seats and are swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He must find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: An end to investment banking, concentration on wealth management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is about to fade, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as merely a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Groebel.
Meanwhile, he has made a name for himself: he is to run UBS’s business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats will be removed.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
In public, however, he says only that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs heavily on the stock market in the US.
The looming recession in Europe has robbed American investors of the courage to start the week.

“We’re not an island, we’re an addict,” said Steve Goldman, Goldman’s executive director.
Europe is not likely to recover from the recession as quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed the outlook: He said in a CNBC-interview that it may not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the share price of the traditional group and allowed it to first quote almost one percent higher against the trend during trading.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints of residents to the dirt and noise caused by animals are accumulating.
However, there is still no way to deal with "problem birds".
Wild boars can no longer be driven out of cities, experts said at the first symposium on crows in East Frisian Leere.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible ways forward.
Look for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also derived urban problems from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: the use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to be increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing buildings and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are located in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in Leer.
There, a 2005 controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district generated negative headlines.
Critics have called the capture of animals into bird traps and the killing of sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, timidity, brings nothing", so much was discovered by the urbanist and landscape designer Werner Kl?ver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and split to other places".
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes, or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle in other places is conceivable.
The "information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Juergens due to the completely different treatment of animals: "One scab in the face can best be overcome with self-confidence in the end."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Mrs. Jurgens co-founded the Ascherberg Nature Trail, on which information boards provide information about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs. Jurgens had her own opinion: "Here it is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: the field ravens do not only use aids to reach the treat, but even make their own tools as aids.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field ravens to see how far the bird’s intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to cause the stones to collapse in order to reach the moth larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have in order to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a moth larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them, she shaped all four animals into a hook, using it as a rod to catch a container from the tube by the handle.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a trap.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks did not come out on the cup.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland received the last tickets to the European Championship 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive appearance in the European Championship after the 0:0 result in the first match.
The Czechs were satisfied with the result 1:0 (0:0) in the Play-off with the outsider Černá Hora, when the first match was a clear thing.
Even Croatia did not score with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a start on peace.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 metres into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-distance shooting, and with a shot from 25 meters, he adjusted to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
Former player Wolfsburu from the English club Manchester City placed the ball on the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the centre.
After an intervention against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36th).
On the opposing side, Stark made a disputed penalty kick after the action by Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic confidently transformed.
But after the break, the European vice-champion of 2004 cleared everything up with four hits.
Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion goes for the fifth time in a row to the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented his own goalkeeper Tomáš Sivok (9th) at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the boundary of the penalty area just past Čech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already beaten goalkeeper of the world-class Czechs, again reduced by the striker FC Soul (50th).
Shortly before the end, everything was clear.
At that moment, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed the status 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to clear his place on the bench at the 2002 World Cup, Croats can rejoice at their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fabulous start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a pole in the seventh minute with a long-range shot, while striker Kazim also could not hang the ball in goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia increasingly took control.
Also after the break Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first appearance at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success of 4-0 in the first match already by a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to the lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) equalized for guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian defense prevented a possible leading goalkeeper.
It was a long way in the 32nd minute.
After failing to defend goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1-0 status.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China.
Europe’s largest software maker, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
It is estimated that about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow into the country by 2015, Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and employ relevant personnel,” said Acting Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is now expected to grow from its current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of the world’s number one in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 customers worldwide are in a booming country.
China’s growth plans are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs earned about 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the world’s 55,000-employee software manufacturer is doing as well as ever.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that make you dizzy.
One piece of advice at a time: Carefully tear out this page and make it a bookmark.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - in moments when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as a "book about what it was like". It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the wartime experiences of 20 men and women, more or less dozen, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fates, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It modifies the notion that World War I was all about the gruesome trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee nests on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, this is a very moving read.
War engulfs people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," remarked Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other published materials.
Descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Substitutions, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wood buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with fake wood bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato husks, shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in sausage production and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds an inner drive for savagery and brutality in himself, whereupon he declares of the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarism inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
"When a person finally comes to terms with sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," she writes.
Instead, he feels like a “condemned man who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict increasingly became economic competition and competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures what he calls "a new kind of beast of the century to come: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his carnage without rising from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, villainy alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“The most desperate people rubbed it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk, but not flashy, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "unleashed absolutely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints, rather than complex narrative, such as Paul Fussell's "First World War and Modern Memories" or novels such as "On the Western Front Quiet" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most devastating ending that is unprecedented in popular science literature.
But I won't tell you.

After a previous mistake, this time for a minute exactly planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one but a few high-ranking officers knew of the action, and the others were initially told that it was an exercise.
The action was spearheaded by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
The cases of recent weeks, when pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, were not allowed to be repeated, thus violating the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park from the protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations carried out in other cities.
A massive exercise for emergency behavior took place in the Randalls Island area, which was in preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot control training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" said someone to whom the event was originally explained only as "exercise".
"I know a couple of police officers who were also called to this event, and no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all around the area, participated in Tuesday's event - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there will be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, with trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and a taped message roaring from the loudspeakers frightened many protesters.
When members of the riot squads entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she did not touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park to break into it if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesman for the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, plus some police officers were rude to them.
Mr Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street running along the park's western boundary could shoot without difficulty.
As the police advanced westward, they weaved through a thick mess of protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitation department who immediately raked up what was left of the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and the documenting images appeared on the Internet shortly after.
The most vicious group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their campground, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up roadblocks and police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were chained to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service members were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organizing riots and resisting arrests," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer at the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called up.
A roadblock was erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others draining air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
Union of Assistant Workers to Sue City for Dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliaries who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, saying layoffs were not necessary and were discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is likely to be the last option left for unions in District Council 37 in their efforts to reverse the dismissal decision.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's worst-paid employees, lost their jobs. Their dismissals were described by union leaders as retaliation for the city's failure to give it access to a health care fund managed by work squads last spring, with which the city wanted to plug a hole in its budget.
City officials categorically rejected the allegations.
At a town council meeting held last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered by saying that the budget did not specifically talk about the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. They will convene a press conference on Wednesday, where they will formally announce the lawsuit in the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff party will be eight laid off workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city to support their claims of unfair conduct, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island area did not open at all and only minimally in the Upper East Side area, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 area in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in the District 8 and 9 areas in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were laid off.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite being a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of able-bodied parents who can raise funds to offset a budget deficit."
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funding was calculated for each enrolled poor student.
Among other things, the unions argue that high school principals may have been confused by the way in which a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, that is, to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," the draft complaint states, "and not just moved to a database on the position of available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something to do with the uprising in Libya.
But before that, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and American troops for their "stability".
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic aspirations."
The sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly arguing with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of statements approving or rejecting the United States’ military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have stopped the financing of American operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in Libya literally in a legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but it clearly did not irritate its members so much as to stop supporting him in his actions.
Congressional hesitancy eventually overtook other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and were killed by Gaddafi on 20 October.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and the admirable tenacity they have expended in trying to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators once again be split in half, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latter version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other topic to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to push their proposals to the vote, despite considerable efforts.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide variety of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
In the House alone, at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment can be found, and another handful who would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship."
The budget regulation decree, passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss limiting the number of terms in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that a president can serve.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a variety of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care, among other things.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the amendment banning the burning of the state flag remain a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in drafting various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress, they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress, there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment that was added, the 27th, was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Bashed but not beaten," Gifford says in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with the tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stating that she is more interested in getting better than returning to Congress.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear that she was still having trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The entire program documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and another 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long episode of the show "20/20", which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has been tracking Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly shot during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can do no more than lift one or two fingers at that time.
Months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
A nod of the head.
Lip bulge.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings along with the therapist on the tunes to "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she doesn’t remember anything about the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn't read Gifford's newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The shooting is suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violently administered drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point during her recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I told her straight away: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, get back together, and come back stronger than ever.”
Military units are met with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for New York City war veterans who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Both men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, also attended the ceremony, but he saw the role of military forces somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often distant, sometimes glorifying, American public.
The army is lavished with praise for its victims.
But this praise costs something, say the soldiers.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for an individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unfortunate souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or ruin their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words about regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations serving as Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by people outside the military.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if “there’s an evil, violent veteran hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who was involved in the fighting in Iraq and took a seat in Washington after returning to the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him inconspicuously suggested that he could resist the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from America's indifference to war.
Success on the battlefield rarely wins recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as normal in World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of the men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is under increasing pressure to crack down on rape.
This week, it will be decided whether to prosecute 28 women and men against the military over alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file a lawsuit.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked if he could join her for a drink in her room.
“A warning light came on in my head,” Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact, set in Arlington, Virginia, on whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiffs had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military failed to investigate, punish, or pursue any kind of justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke says she's after the top military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The Army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - stacking all the eggs in one basket, she says - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if the pressure is needed to keep up.
The Defense Department’s defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - essentially the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs' military service," the document said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women found in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers died - two-thirds of them in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition to her, three other attorneys deal with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere promoting hatred for women.
Independently of this, the nonprofit organization of U.S. Vietnamese veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on diagnosing a "personality disorder" that was allegedly found in rape victims to give the military an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati belonging to the Human Rights Fighters' Service Women's Action Network absolutely a running practice.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state veterans’ organization, accusing it of discriminatory practices that were to occur when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate motions were presented to Congress by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures in them.
According to the Department of Defense's Office for Preventing and Addressing Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
The report, released in March, also looks at the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to court - half of the number in the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the Burke case describe the attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
Private Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various police members, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was given a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses for the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered her to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, declaring her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and thus without entitlement to a pension.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs move on to the next phase or not, it’s a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the negotiation."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind because their responsibilities do not allow for the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favor, Burkevoa, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to file suit and begin working on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the military on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July killing rampage that left 77 people dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for the researchers to simply use the site’s advertising to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for with absolute accuracy, something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, and they focused their attention on them and sent them advertisements, but instead of inviting them to join a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, spurred by rising rates of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health problems to social trends hiding behind status updates, wall posts, and "like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on a daily basis, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in the name of which the word Facebook occurs, increased from five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"Previously, when you wanted to do a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go to a party where they’d never let you go,” Bartlett says.
"This is all Facebook is tearing down - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken output on Facebook were much more likely to have an alcoholism problem than students who kept quiet about the topic.
Moren suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that we would not otherwise have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The site's information team has produced statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction rate (mainly using information they had access to - proponents of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for research to others as well).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most people thought scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to mean that the information was only between them and their friends."
Next, consider the issue of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening off-line."
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because you have been given a mandate by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which to voice his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barring him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and announcing that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept firmly locked up.
They all attended in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhumane," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and departure into the building, the journalists and the survivors were able to face each other without difficulty.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge indicated that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
It may be comforting to some that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
“If I did, everything would be so much easier.”
7 Lessons From A Lost Interview With Steve Jobs In A Movie Heading To The Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge - and they elected him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off for a special movie heading to theaters this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who tunes every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between a great idea and an excellent end product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show The Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hour-long conversation took place.
It’s been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and eager to see the general public embrace the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interviews were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs thinks the answer perfectly to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatiently on Cringely’s questions and drives him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, and comes with frighteningly prophetic thoughts as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It wasn’t long before he started putting his ideas into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years of business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer has always been, ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs", he could only guess about their amount. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs in a moment.
As he made a mockery of the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and switched from one AT&T network to another during a call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least a half-dozen times we've been around the world like this, so when we yelled something into the pay phone, it came out a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
“We were young, and we found out that we could build a thing that could manage billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a prank he and Wozniak almost pulled to an end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican asking if they could talk to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, senior members of the Catholic Church were called in to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up the pope himself, the pair giggled and put the handset down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a clock, he found Bill Hewlett's number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had an incredible impact on me. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I instantly fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hung around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How he innovates:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he invents new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a couple of printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
"I remember we had a pretty wild fight... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are taking their breath away:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foresaw that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already ruling, so companies are run by people who are in charge of just that, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft in the '90s.
Instead of winning, they lost.
How he takes innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long way to go between a great idea and a great end product... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows."
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a lot of compromises - certain things you just don't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind at all times - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on your taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren’t for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was being dealt with by a court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by the law firm that will attend the hearing before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions made.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges have agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, which will further boost the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the ruling.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has long been dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court debated the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the featured guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been attending the Federalist Society’s events for years.
And it is certainly not something that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the code of conduct that lower federal judges are subject to.
If this were not the case, however, their conduct would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in events that currently related and other organizations hold for the purpose of raising funds, however, the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or be featured on the program of the event."
Yet the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct goes against several judges' claims that the Supreme Court is behaving according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dined at a social benefit together with solicitors waiting to hear their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the legs of any claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they also seamlessly combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives object that Judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the bill appeared before the court.
Critics of Kagan push her to disavow participation in the case, claiming she fought for the law as much as she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn’t say she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record $18 billion jet order
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 two-aisle jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air for more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is Boeing Co., and the cost of those 50 planes combined is a record $18 billion, that’s different.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever order for a dollar worth of commercial aircraft, the 50-two-aisle Boeing 777 jets, over the weekend.
The contract was signed by Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said it had the option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order value to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, also known as Dreamliners, which boast significantly improved fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging to the airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial, because the country itself is profiting from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and puts Airbus SAS in a tight spot to try to erode Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the first flight of its largest A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The postponement occurred because customers demanded more payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to be able to give the machine more engine power.
The stock price of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Defeated in Michoacán Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of the PRI, was aided in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost in the violent state election for the governorship of Michoacán, and on Monday she subsequently claimed that one of her opponents was helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results attributed leadership in the Western state's gubernatorial election to Faust Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday's elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country as a whole," said Maria Calderon.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... they confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and had people vote to order for the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and winning the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have defeated Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, only very close.
Calderon, the conservative candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has dominated the governorship until now, is a very unfortunate defeat for a bickering and haplessly persecuted party ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state's capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon and it was in Michoacan in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
However, the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates resigned from the election out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks like for the PRI party, the victory of the party will help to gain a new impetus.
The PRI's expected representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington congratulated Vallejo, saying, "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy that would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European troubles "too unexcitedly" and said Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, would help stave off the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she's certainly not immune."
“So if China and India can help, they definitely should.”
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a severe debt crisis for several months.
Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously in recent days, and both the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s growing debt crisis has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge for emerging leading economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to do with helping European economies face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India's 1.2 billion inhabitants, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less per day.
"One day they might find out that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain to them," he noted.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why India's supplies should be used to keep many Greek citizens well-paid in poorly managed and loss-making sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis was threatening a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "risk of decline" due to a European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to develop "unpredictable spending plans" to protect them from falling and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta slammed the bill in Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next 10 years, but now fears a $600 billion cut if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate drop and the halting of many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three quarters of the building or ships. In addition, further modernization efforts could be seriously damaged," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the reduction is to be made so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
“Although the accounts for possible overseas military operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets,” Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The paid staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and consequent disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators wrote Panetta back ten days ago asking him for details on possible impacts on automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don’t want to sign it.”
"Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and amplify the voices calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta has been more and more open in talks about possible cuts recently, even though he himself switched to his senior Pentagon position with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was embarking on a tough fight.
At a press conference held for a minute the Minister of Defence gave a brief picture of what his ministry can expect - the shell of the army, but inside which the core will be missing.
"He will be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be like the Air Force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of a speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts, and disasters; significant limitations on the possibility of airdrops and deployments around the world; presumed unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could be expected to come to an end, including those that are already being tested and those that are still in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the design of the F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marines wanted to replace with a humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military that is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glance at recent headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with allegations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claiming the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar with his microphone down.
A lie could destroy entire careers and cloud the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using his campaign funds to try to conceal his illegitimate relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that rallied around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's all just stories of cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, only to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and deception is acceptable.
How many frauds do we encounter?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies," is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or business reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar to, say, a charade in which a person shouts, "I got you." The recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproved.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing, or sewing.
But don’t assume that it’s difficult to spot and spot the liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years amassing scientific knowledge from a vast and evolving industry related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can be of great help in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating, or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, channel their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "self-centered" lies - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (although the lies they tell are usually "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have later findings to compare with.
Note the posture of the subject, his laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone routinely taps their feet all the time so that you don’t unjustifiably accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as a warning sign, not as evidence of a lie.
Lying people can stop moving the upper half of their body as they try to remember their imaginary story, they can turn the tips of their shoes towards the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change posture, or show "relief after the conversation" - exaggerated relief respite and change of position when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewers will often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Also, consider the subject’s language.
There is a famous story about how Scott Peterson once misspelled and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which launched a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals can also express themselves in a measured manner: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady...Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "relieving language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not learn much facts, and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills to track down a lie.
Using these skills, a person will have a better chance of not fooling some liar and cheater in his personal and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Construction Plan Will Be Redirected After U.S. Government Threats to Delay Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - pitting trade unions against each other but calming environmentalists - the company in charge of the pipeline construction announced it was willing to redirect the project so that things could get moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was postponing a federal approval decision for the project, from where it would not conduct studies of possible alternate routes by which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really a step forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Foreign Ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the next year’s elections, but the authorities reject that any role of a politician would play in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
It flows 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
Six countries will have to cross this road.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work squads who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the inspector general from the ministry ordered a re-examination of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
Once upon a time, a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, was not a conflict of interest in the program.
Another was whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making a toddler throw up in fear
A New York family says singer Patti LaBelle stormed the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter into throwing up.
The singer's performance of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk came down with her luggage to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Somebody showed up behind my back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and left to pick her up"
LaBelle exasperated the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she told me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care about your opinion.'"
She became enraged and began to speak rudely - loudly shouting the most vulgar expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started splashing water on me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, who then dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesperson did not respond to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit demands unspecified compensation, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased, and with it the economy
2011 will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, they are responsible for a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historic decrease of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to a damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed, and on the remaining 21.07% was found partial damage. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose by approximately 9.28%, and between July and August the average.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the public policy level.
“We are seeing rising unemployment linked to various factors, including loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest or use them for anything,” he stressed.
Stopping the Migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state work without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Other features of the labor market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, wages from the whole country are the lowest, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, with foreign direct investment reaching $630,697 in January-June, down 87.74% from $5,143,312 in the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government lists investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year.
Debts
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. Until November, no profits were recorded from debt, not in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to a lack of managerial skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really minuscule during this year. We need to work hard to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we need to double the effort, there was no harmonization of the efforts of all of us, and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year had halted the state's economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we were well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefining the Mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilized," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress when it comes to conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that the work done here is visible, and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army forces on June 7, 2010 while on a errand in Cipriano Valdez street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato district.
The dealer was in a white pick-up van. He had a black bag in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained available to the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Public Places Rescue and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being completed or of having a long delay due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has progressed so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied the funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They are to secure almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. And even though we should have received a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started projects and are continuing very successfully, but we are running out of money."
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, so at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite there being a promise from state officials to hand over these resources, he stated that a request had been sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary for Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even received a peso yet."
Court Approves 'End of Analogous Broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "turning off analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that the necessary eight votes were not found to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree outlining the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because the qualified majority of eight votes needed to allow the court to express its opinion on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure measures through general standards to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, with better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that postponing the change would delay the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision on a matter of public interest, since digitalisation has not only a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a disapproving decree that to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress, to bring into the administration the observance of laws prepared by legislative power.
In Michoacán analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 votes out of 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The vote-by-vote option appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and it has not yet been counted by 879 votes from a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chair of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act, because the state congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to publish them within the set deadline in the Official State Gazette Act, stating that he had some objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "either approve or veto them".
When asked about the possibility of a "vote by vote" census, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, with the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for both the partial and the overall census to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, of one or more election packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the President; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence to suggest that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the party and/or coalition representative who proposed the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
A total recount will also be possible if, after a proper tally, it is found that the difference between the probable winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate finished in second place. In this case, electoral packages for which a partial tally has been made will be eliminated.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 out of 923 electoral districts have not yet been added.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, a ceremony and a memorial service will take place.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range.
After receiving the highest honors with the other people killed in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a Mexican Air Force plane.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony took place at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo, and his wish was that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all the wishes, he was at the peak of life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however, he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "he barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died while doing what he liked best in life: flying a plane.
They gave him one last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technological High School of Saltillo, where he studied sports in 1985 and where he excelled in both the study of sports.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. On board was also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of this state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of the Saltille native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be given to the Mexican Air Force, under the command of Major Jaime Martinez, in the square where, meanwhile, the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three dead bodies found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the find, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting at various parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farmhouse in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred on a 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyto to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people was wearing a sports T-shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was also a person in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were facing the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three people were likely murdered at another location because no bullets were found.
Messages were found on the fence of the cottage addressed to one group of organized crime by another, as well as a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secrets presented 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to published information, during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were detained and one person was freed.
Three properties and a cell phone have been secured, confirming that they are members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
A further raid occurred on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they spotted a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these testimonies, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on 13 November at around 2 pm.
They were charged with illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is holding the country over the abyss of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face a crisis that is holding the country over the abyss of economic disaster and that has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm to him that he can form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles were being overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has pushed its debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders, only to restore Italy's compromised credibility.
Due to market volatility, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity have exceeded the 7 percent threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this predicament.
Monti's hopes for success have been greatly increased thanks to the support of PDL's Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now, a number of its members have opposed a government with a technocratic majority formed by Monti.
Support of Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could spell disaster.
Monti opened talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations on Monday.
The round ends Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who allowed a very quick move in response to the crisis.
After a short decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, the interest rates on Italian bonds have returned to a critical limit, reacting to the uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is worth 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will give him time only to implement reforms, and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties the country has come into because of financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to incorporate both political figures into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the 50-match mark.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called-up players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today for a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one of FIFA’s monthly ratings, have a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches to their credit, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who has played 50 international matches alone.
He reached this number last Friday during a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Star Games and in the powerful English First League clubs, maintain intense activity over the year at league championships and home cups and high-level matches within the European Cups as Champions League.
We must also add to the previous experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the biggest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (lose 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also face Costa Rica today and set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA, along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches to their credit, among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came in with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman move left winger Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 broke the 30 match limit: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, they include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar has only one, and Oelman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate twenty years of existence
"A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is set to offer one of the best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That’s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band will be touring the South American continent to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will be making a unique stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
This day will perform at 7:30 pm at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will be playing in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Traveling to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
We are in South and Central America for only the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because here they literally adore the group, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have been done in a matter of weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope we got in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf-friendly waves?
We have a lot of surf friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've put on a great show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played here, we have no limits on what we could do.
We will try to show the best show with diverse songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and we'd be in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much has been given to us and we are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We’re lucky to be able to see the places we’ve always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the genre of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which all the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to arise from one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think that firstly we are all lucky to be still in this world and secondly the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to that we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate each other’s music and I don’t think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect music and what you gave it. You must not get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us ever really cared.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something great in the beginning.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how incredible I was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, to have fun with him.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
National band Las Robertas will be tasked with launching the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as opening act?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I think of bands that I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came together at the same time, and if that’s true today, it’s something great, because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent just that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make bleak music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is now under medical control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he hurts and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could receive a pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not wish the pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times due to cancer of the tongue, lost 18 kilograms and these problems were accompanied by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor named.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and touch on the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to be tax havens would be excluded from the international community, a statement that provoked a backlash from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries. It has had an information exchange agreement with that Latin American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) blacklist, to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has boosted trade between the two countries.
Bearded plumber running in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never yet appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was created from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy is supposed to work without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, a Nintendo press officer in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium", because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can embark on the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D, in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Mario in 3D is also expected with the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the notes of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous episodes. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the moves, in the neighborhood, in disguise and also among enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approved Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former President Alfons Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a $70 million US laundering conspiracy.
Thus ends a process aimed at getting Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country to extradite Portillo in order to try him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he was mindful that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he had "not interfered" with court decisions and had allowed all the extraditions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead a trial against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzlement of $120 million at the Department of Defense at the time of his presidency, a process that preceded extradition, but the Department of Public Affairs appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion received help. The organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundreds of jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of the ceremony, which took place in the former Fabra i Coats factory premises and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the election, showed the uniform character of the work carried out by Trinijov.
Along with President Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Councillor Ricardo Goma attended the ceremony.
The big hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Triniove originated at a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The president cited Trinikov as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of the seized house, in which gigantic parties were held
Invaders take possession of 11 of 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
The nightmare of the neighbors at 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally living in yesterday at noon, where they organized gigantic parties that woke the neighbors. They left the building by order of the court and without the need for the police to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly also water equipment, in addition, they painted the walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held in the first three apartments, lasting up to two days and waking up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales had fallen by 80% during the time the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building made it unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to complaints from neighbors due to noise, but the problems were not caused by visitors to the discotheque, but by the residents of the seized house, and especially those who attended the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and had been forgiving her rent for nine months.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past weeks about the situation.
Last week, the president of the People's Party's municipal group PP in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted, thus putting an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The leader of the people explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there have even been thefts.
He added: “We need to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to the acts against civil responsibility that took place in the building.”
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police entered building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which involves more than a controversy about fees
The municipal tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, during the heyday of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of the metropolitan city of Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park has returned to the minds of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south axis, but up (up) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collseroly as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
Either that, or someone's trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central topic of all Barcelona architects.
It's as old a topic as when two members of this old caste of chosen ones shake hands when they meet in an elevator.
It was this act that created one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the pre-graduate university professors thought.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the question of the bay side began, "it is also necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so that Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not completed.
“We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "Gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as demarcations of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" posing "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty presented today by the project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the area of the Forum "its swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, to go one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus in more detail on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "cannot end up in a garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his Bureau to intervene in the project from "the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of cul-de-sac that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, since Collserola's global vision is missing in the background for the tender: "There have been 16 tenders that deal with all the axes of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes at least he, applied to all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may allude to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide a zone of equipment along the entire length, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino apologizes to Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal counsel Cadino Red granted pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal has been in prison for 72 days and will now be released after being pardoned by Casino Red's legal representative before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which dealt with the racketeering case in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was indicted.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García posted a series of photos and videos of Manuel Jonás asking him to pay an economic quota to allow the town hall in Monterrey to operate illegally in a betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution of the brother of a panistic mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained at this location for the next 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued, and a Public Ministry agent disproved the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to remain in the city cells at San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been collected to prove Jonas' guilt. Among the evidence, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be made possible.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region. Based on this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damages had been repaired and who of the associates decided to grant the pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. No complaint can be filed in the trial that has been conducted against him. Nor is it possible to seek damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal representative around 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case had been deferred to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome gave details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter hit the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to try to make a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Communications and Transport Secretary, said the pilot had stated before the plane took off that the climate conditions made the flight possible.
"Parts appearing suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, wings entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that based on the investigation carried out in the area of impact, no components were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit land as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services stated that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that this was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jacome enumerated six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, accordingly, the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew were looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft remains indicates that the helicopter was solid at the time of impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show images that probably broke down along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, in an area larger than the demarcation area, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Research on the Gene That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of National Remembrance
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Obesity genetics in children and adolescents" will allow to get results regarding overweight.
In a report, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit at the 21st Century National Health Center’s Specialized Hospital, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers had been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without authorization, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where each council will be tested by minors from 8 o'clock.
He stressed that the research began at the Sports Center Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity has also been carried out at the Sports Center Nezahualcóyolt (East of Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are collected, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors to Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are made anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify the genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflected health officials’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was an increase in obesity in boys by 77% and in girls by 47%. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said an expert from IMSS.
He stated that one of the reasons for searching for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He noted that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that an individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
For now, the information is confidential, doctors give it in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children getting the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, all-day sitting in front of the TV, and the use of means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by a large caloric intake, that is, greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If paving were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, adding that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even a complete elimination of them.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Potholes, which he delivered during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight, which are called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called mortars. Together, they give asphalt its typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, the expert on chemical engineering pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt liner, formed by small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to decompose well.
If it was modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer, called the mantle, is placed on the asphalt liner, consisting of fine stone, i.e. sand also embedded in the asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt liner and ensure road friction.
Since it will be exposed to a lot of stress as part of the paving, the cladding must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken with the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inward and it is difficult to get out, this causes all layers of paving to soften and thus create potholes.
He explained that during the creation of potholes, the film of the shell is damaged first and only then the asphalt liner is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed not to exceed this load. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent occurrence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not winning the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multiplemiss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium, receiving a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's finale in Cartagena, in which she won the Girona (1989), Girona won the Miss Atlántico, the department won the 14th title of the first multimiss. Thus, Melina joined the ranks of the women of Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were finally announced by the first multimiss. Among them is Miriam Ospina Bero (1979).
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result was the defeat of a great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the potential to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing she became the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Italiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently also took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that determined that the jury decided to name her only First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince by her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", posed by Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary editorial office of Leamos.
To the question, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culturalization. The book that most influenced me in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was disliked both because of the term "culturalize" and because the candidate did not explain what the individual books had noted to her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read it if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one that took away all the previous awards (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressing the queen, who then burned on the scene.
This was evident during the first swimwear presentation at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although it shone on both of them, it was clear that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN's "Like Home" program, believes that Melinda's winning the title of first multimiss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition ultimately does not walk away with the Queen's crown".
In addition, Valle has been rather unkind to the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country’s social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social sensibilities. It is important that the candidates before entering the competition are involved in such projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was noticeable on her buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis in the buttocks, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, only took away points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a Valle native made a mistake by undergoing several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong point and here she took her toll".
Because of this award, which was given for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimwear show, a cruel prediction came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina, so that he did not have to award her the highest crown in the end.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina has today begun the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, to which she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the thrilling success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the job of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
Cali's fingerprint expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of Farc's supreme leader: "Alphonse Cano", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in the field of forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the Chocó City Hall, where he often had to pierce the forest for more than five days to get to the site where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of rubbing the skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for a minimum of three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify the two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the scene of the body, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But prints don't lie.
Along with a galton magnifying glass, ink, and a transplanter, and a light, Eliazar began to compare the date records of the corpse with those of the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a Puerto Tejada-born man was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was indeed the supreme commander of Farc.
Search for Stops
For the dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, that can play a key role in criminal decision-making.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in researching crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present false papers or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator told that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because at this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not meant to take fingerprints, but in this case we could get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove a suspicion in a murder case.
Recently, a man was found dead with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the imprint on the bottle actually confirmed this.
Although it is impossible to 100% confirm that he was really the murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that fingerprints are "wiped off objects using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are currently many Colombians whose data is not recorded anywhere," said the expert from the CTI.
He explained that not everything is as it is shown in the CSI television program.
Just as everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch has traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignados" protest in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were escorted out in the morning, before attempting to seize another New York City park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allows the "indignant" to return to camp on the spot. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesman for the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the response by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to the eviction had reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the eviction and allowing protesters to continue camping there.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the farmland of Trinity Church, also seized the "indignation".
Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw some journalists being handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express support for them and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed, with a trial expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the protesters were even distributing and handing out copies of the court order, and even handing them out to officers who patrolled the square, prompting "some small clashes," Bray said, denouncing the fact that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "laws that were published after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and acceded to because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to be evacuated because it had become "a place where people didn't go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others" because "some stores got threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The morning eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of "not valuing freedom of expression."
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said they plan to hold "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since they began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to introduce Virgin Mary on Christmas special
Along with Michael Bublé and other notable Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a lifeguard on Baywatch, a bunny on Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Canadian TV Christmas show.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show It's a Russell Peters Christmas on December 1 and embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornography images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "M?tley Cr?e", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in a manger representing Baby Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent, recently acted as a presenter on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on a special Christmas CTV broadcast.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "a fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of downturns that began in March.
Japan's economy has been paralyzed since March last year, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government have put the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that heals well despite a difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September fell to such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese the tax year begins in March 2012 - assume the highest growth rate compared to the period January-March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the purchase of machinery that is necessary for the recovery of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse to use the crisis to come out of it to strengthen or to rebuild infrastructure, to take advantage of the scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma Yenu
Flows have been placed in the hands of the internal market when the yen - Japan's currency - has become one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and worrying U.S. forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on export businesses.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September to the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to besiege the EU's periphery countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We need to pay attention to the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase of the yen," Motohisa Furukawa, the country's secretary of state for economic policy, said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It fell four-tenths to 100.4 points versus 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the 100-point average, reaching 99.13 points.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again
Papademos says austerity measures will be approved, but Conservatives won't sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky collateral margins and the uncertainty that has reignited, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth that leads to an exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The notion that the “agreement” of the new transitional Greek government is dictated more by the demands of Brussels than by the real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papademos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given on his appointment was likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections to be held on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papademos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the Disciplinary Code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear any doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader has gone a little too far in his speech to the EU and the IMF to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he also said he would not support or sign any commitment to austerity.
The European Commission, already angered by the impact of Papandreou's referendum games, yesterday stressed that its demands are unsurpassed: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government on "what it takes to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion.
So the Greek spinner has a little more to knit with.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second giver of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th World Microloans Summit in Valladolid, convinced that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals of halving the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, that is, the amount that sets the poverty rate".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The micro-loan summit is not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support the “fundamental goals”.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of microloans has spread to Spain and other countries around the world after "a pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus", the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and needed recognition".
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to combat poverty". She got acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his loan policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others: the first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development," explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title of "head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia ended her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and find solutions to enable them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must abide by.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the balohobyte period, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, celebrating a concept based on giving confidence to people to whom everyone else closes the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was only in the autumn that the party members, who consider the policy of the government today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians, were satisfied.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
A few minutes’ ovation at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor, “the time for change has come in Europe.”
This could be reflected in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the universal suffrage 'to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary move: the United Kingdom is opposed, and the leaders of the CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in an increase in the weight of Germany.
Worried about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to win the congress by talking about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Job Incapacity Fraud?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December to visit the social welfare office, where he will give a speech on a theme that has been recurring since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
Accompanying this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of sick leave on private sector workers before they start taking sick leave.
Clearly, without the consent of the enterprise, the employee who falls ill would lose four days of pay, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity (so far they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority is also triggering a fraud theme, this time focused on abuses linked to incapacity for work.
"The checks will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the injustices of incapacity for work.
These have, in fact, been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of a political onslaught that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, in 2008, daily compensations of 11.3 billion euros accounted for 5% of health care expenditures.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and work-related accidents, and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which hides some deviations: another poll published in 2007 on job sites dealing with Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incapacity than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absenteeism (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in the face of incapacity for work is a very small part of it compared to black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only of a small scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM noted that at 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 performed were due to short-term incompetences "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
For systematically controlled incompetences of more than 45 days, 11% of cases "unadapted or unauthorised" were counted at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
In total, 169,000 “unauthorized” cases were reported for several million workers who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number that represents work on black.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euro gap in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before parliament, adding that a hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To get our economy back on track, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," he said in his first public speech at the start of a vote of confidence in parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Opposition to New Austerity Measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday for measures already passed to try to escape the debt crisis, but said his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on deficit and debt reduction targets and the fight against waste, but we oppose any policy that would impede the economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert committee
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are being denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of a large-scale report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
In the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the wish to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest with 86% of people dying in hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also controlled all countries where these approaches are legalized or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is causing any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons inappropriate or disapproving.
In contrast, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more cases of these abuses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia.
Recall that according to a poll conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean sending a message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are worth less.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be educated to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or terminal relief already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over the age of 18 could ask to be helped to commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the report.
Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report place the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a 'manifesto for euthanasia'."
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, especially doubts the data of the report regarding the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus speaks of "complexity"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia’s support, is resisting them and talking about a “conflict” against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension from the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbour, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordanian King Abdallah II was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighbouring Syria.
The United States rejoiced at the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest behavior of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone” against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces were killed in Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was “getting out of the crisis”.
He also reacted to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus, which he called a “dangerous step.”
Syria “will not bow down,” he added, with assurances that “conflicts spun against Syria will not succeed.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also sympathetic to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he says is behaving "paranoidly".
A new special meeting of the League is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and in which it was envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by disputes and the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the Arab League's decision "wrong", while China urged Syria to accept the plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices from Italians
Italy's next head of government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unionists and employers today.
He should form a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important agenda with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the designed prime minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament by Friday for a vote of confidence to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation ends with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for their time.
In 'democracy', the exact terms apply when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he was 'sure that the markets will be patient and understanding'.
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern resurfaced after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team that includes mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive confidence in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy a "strong link" again in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria head Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth can not comply with deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the editorials, the "call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "an epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The big unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place 200 billion euros worth of government bonds.
Soviet Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked by the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its “serious concern” about the “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS widely drawing on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was supposed to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was scheduled to work on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear indications that Iran's development of the detonation system" was "based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked on the technology during a substantial part of his career as part of the country's military nuclear programme."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Offences Increase by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and torts targeting Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or rose little.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase over the 13% rate for acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease for offences against Jews, and an overall 14% increase for anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and offences rise again," Human Rights First said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s leaders.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the Civil Rights Era.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter, a microblogging service provider, introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe follow-up activity, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers allow you to know more about the activities of other people who are following you or whose answers ("tweets") you are following.
This lets you know if they allow you to track posts, if they sign in to new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested “in August on a small percentage of users” before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniable
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space, and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will better help me follow some elements of my Twitter feed", sent by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of the Golden Rule on Balanced Budget into the Constitution
The government of Austria’s grand coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats decided on Tuesday to include the “golden rule” of budget policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade by Austria’s rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of a ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the criterion of no more than 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the Euro Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts be enshrined in the Constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene in foreign exchange markets again if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Y. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values, which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in effect since 1945.
But since then, it has steadily increased in support of investors’ purchases, who see it as a “safe haven” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar again fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark near the levels that prompted the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained by Japanese firms from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this increase in the price of the yen will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a single year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of households burdened by the disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's vice-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issuance Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bills and raised the ceiling of 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of the amounts it spends on purchases of various securities to flood in with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rates are rising, stock markets are failing.
The risk of contagion to the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris at 10 a.m. the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index is down 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions surrounding the yields on euro zone sovereign loans that are in trouble, the stock markets around the world continue to yield only a fraction of recent gains.”
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which it suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, with a retreat of 0.4%.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party backed down after it accepted a proposal at its congress on Monday to leave the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce market participants’ concerns.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti strongly demanded time in the markets to be able to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October will be his government's "main task".
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the country's House of Commons are held on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expected growth figures for the euro area
The statistics say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised down the figures for the second quarter to a 0.1% drop in GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, this is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050 if we do not want a significant part of the world's population to be deprived of an important part of life.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be tackled in order to continue producing electricity, while not forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident at Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
However, this is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the last generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, are continuing with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power, which consumes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, which makes CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity higher by 65% or 50%, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of Europe’s cheapest electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay, just as they fundamentally do not oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The heavily exporting sector has attracted a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
Should France decide to leave the nuclear power plant, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the 6 billion euros a year it receives for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to fail?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, indeed, that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 installations, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal traffic conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers, the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF, and paving the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the congestion of police, courts and administrations subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "land of human rights" that France boasts.
More recently, it was administrative harassment of foreign students, which became topical when the Interior Minister (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses”.
But so far it has rarely been discussed from an economic point of view.
It should be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of an invasion by hordes of Polish plumbers into French territory was shared to the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we deign to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banality, stating that common development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published paper Synthesizing the Latest Knowledge on Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages, and employment in immigrant countries.
Restrictions on immigration are crippling growth and damaging employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are far more a complement than a surrogate for French workers by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants are causing immigrant arrivals to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenses) of EUR 150000 to public budgets throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish to go for the missing percentages of growth "with priced teeth".
These teeth used to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an “instrument of oppression,” as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy demands much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of the Greek yes-no referendum in this regard will have the value of a double revelation: revealing the necessity of a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can gain nothing if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganised.
Bianco exposed to a European absolutist monarch or jump with his feet bound into the void of nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we would not know where to stop any more - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty urgently needs to be returned.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the rule of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new phase of European construction.
In order to be a republic in France, it was necessary to be a republican.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans in order to build Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world chip card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most significant is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or make purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being towed by APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big chains work for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes this year.
In order to qualify for a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to perform transactions.
“They are late.”
"But their true momentum should be in the next year".
“For 2012, we estimate global sales of 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone clients and co-workers will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Société générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had "gained confidence" about this from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without further specifying.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by members of the AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by special French troops.
In the rubble after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person said to be close to the AQI and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is showing itself more and more actively,” Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said in a statement.
In recent months, this “support” has become more and more evident in the development and manifestation of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which now include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Rapid success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has been a rapid success.
The sect politicizes and demands strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its followers launch a struggle against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters become extremely active, multiplying their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response is the same.
The army encircles the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has become radicalized and is leaving its post in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he carried out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Iger and the Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is on alert and ready to "hand over all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are racing in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
If you listen to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been repeating the loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy that have traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel merge.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race to nominate the Republican "Grand Old Party," threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency," a central theme in America exacerbated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse still, if this must involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost stumbled at an attitude that “smooths” emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is last in the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
“If elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry, and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far from the 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has had no confidence in the military interventions that lead to embarrassment.
And with arguments that America needs to be rebuilt economically to be able to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking at the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas to Europe
The long-distance Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has begun to operate.
It must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday’s inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe every year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania region.
The second pipeline, which has to be completed by the end of 2012, will enable a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, which is equal to the total French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic states strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being routed by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some of their power: the possibility of putting pressure on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the “new German-Soviet pact”, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained more certainty in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created rifts between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Just five years ago, Russia succeeded in pushing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-intensive Western states, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” said Fillon at the opening ceremony, demonstrating the point at which large gas contracts are a matter of both political and economic importance.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom’s leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical feat.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields from the time of World War II.
"For security reasons, almost 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens M?ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations on its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see Russian state society settle permanently off their coasts.
“In the event of a fault, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,” explains Jens M?ller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, because the welds were designed so that leaks arise once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline from the outside is controlled by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the interior of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
It will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts at the destination for three days at a speed of 3 m/s.
The pipeline was designed to last 50 years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
Gazprom remains in the lead, holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company all its gas transport capacity for five years under a contract that can be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the volume of gas it transports,” explains Jens M?ller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the exit gate of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
As of Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white color as if aged over time.
Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used, for example, to adjust the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly regarded by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has brought back an old and forgotten item that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will captivate the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
The image of Moleskine’s notebook is that its owners are people cosmopolitan, cultivated and open minded.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the middle of the cities, where he was able to assert his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new notebook records commemorating a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the proportion of unemployed disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week of employment for disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled people is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No, underscores Eric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes a Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that many obstacles remain for unemployed disabled people before they start working.
They are elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers interviewed had a "poor level of knowledge about disabled persons" with an "exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, give a figure of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is responsible for charging companies that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of 'fine' enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What happiness"
Before they challenge the French national team (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after an angry gesture by his striker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach only spoke words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward", assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches,"it's one and the same, he apologizes."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my mark."
Gambling, scrutinized against Romania on Thursday night over this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glow up".
The term “joy” cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so, because opposite "are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
“We crossed immediately.”
"The power to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens was also fond of “proudness”.
"Proud" to fight"match - holiday".
"Proud" also to state in the quality of "neighbors" that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, "once again became a very high-level team".
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 in the direction of... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they have a healthy hunger."
"You'll realize it for the next few games." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches with great optimism a barrage against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes away from happiness.
It remains to play one match and one opponent - Bosnia.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of predominance, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would have relieved him.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside.”
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling cauldron there, even if the match definitely seems "very balanced", says the optimist but keenly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," the 42-year-old coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance of being in Euro 2012,” said Queiroz.
The indecisive match in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win.
An undecided match can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside,” Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they "don't give them time to think."
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
