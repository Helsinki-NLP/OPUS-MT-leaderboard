Republican Party strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies with the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
In fact, Republican attorneys have only seen 300 cases of voter fraud in the U.S. in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make the process of election or enrollment difficult.
After the November 2010 election, there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the electoral roll on the day of the elections and remove the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID to be presented to voters.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the United States was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e., 21 million people of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state's government office.
Furthermore, about five million new voters did not have such ID in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their adherence to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather Republican candidates to use cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, 12 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states backed legislation that would repeal voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to enroll.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million residents.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in new voter enrolment in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the passing of laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
In part, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of passed laws and see them as an apparent effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitation of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed that those who did not go to the examination had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases after 12 years.
So I recommend screening from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relative has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are inert.
Therefore, it is necessary to properly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not have an impact on life in the long run, and focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will offer them active supervision and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often and with greater accuracy, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not to treat.
However, I recommend that you do the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows evaluation for and against PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce disease risks.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Also, some percentage remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight (kg)
Fatigue and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Consuming too much can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Canning meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet reached clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although, according to one of them, the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study speaks rather about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not known.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
“Getting tested doesn’t mean you’ll have cancer.”
the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
It is also the last particle predicted by the standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - that has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle that closely resembles the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the large physics congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data are still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that this is a Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what it's really about.
There is an unquestionable law in this world that says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
This rule can not be bypassed - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides the particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli's principle.
And at the other end are bosons, vile anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: mesons, which we leave unnoticed here, and "power particles", with which great natural forces are spread and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is due to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interference" will arise an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "bearers of force".
A more stable field
It is also the case with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disconnected" in order for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of a pond, only a very large boulder will clear.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of the part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with friendly beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
Again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field lends itself to clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep by itself on the refrigerator.
And it is equally true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research for, what will it "bring to us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any inconsistencies between observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, not many physicists literally want to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has huge flaws so far, it does not bring any explanation of gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (ouch!).
However, until now, CERN has not found such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these studies in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Novak can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not initially plan it that way, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC must necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative Care: The Best Way to Get Out of Life by Le Devoir
Through his Commission on the Dignity of Dying, Quebek recently became involved in a delicate issue concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue soon, and a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which fed him, gave him a two-year delay.
“They gave me five years to live, and it’s been seven years,” Victor-Gadbois said in his bed at the palliative care home in Beloeil.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: his immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or to eat alone.
He looks back at the delicious breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by him, bringing him medicines, offering him a bath.
The courage to die a simple death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of this diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“Throughout one’s life one learns that men pee standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"Depends on which person's abilities" whether he will accept the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of many people who deal with palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation in full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she allows us to put a breathing apparatus on her.
He is looking forward to his last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 people.
That is very little if we realize that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi can be given to him, to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night they brought beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, the days go by one by one, but they do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who rejoices at his last encounter with his family, thoroughly backed up on pillows while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, a woman, and two young children after trying every possible way to survive.
“For half a year now, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer up to 45 years old,” says Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stages of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental inaccessibility of healthcare in Quebec that has led many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by leaders in the field of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be agreed upon.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is concerned that patients will not be asked to be killed because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Her chances of survival were minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, telling us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative pussy team eased their pain.
However, palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Grand Montréal area, patients resist pain management in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether the sedatives are given to him permanently or not.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” rather it means “I want you to relieve me of pain.”
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafias mingle.
This "field" came very expensive to Quebec taxpayers especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took fundamental measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It sparked a scandal in 2011 following a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec’s road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only approved after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding, and corruption by state officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars in contracts," when some people have kept their instincts in check to get a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission has "already led two mayors to resign," adding with the hope that it will succeed in "uncovering the cunning of some people."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 also engages in combat with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of "Marteau's retinue", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money pipelines" significantly eased the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, a number of searches have been carried out, accusing a number of municipal officials of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Gilles Vaillancourt has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal-based transport engineers and Italian-born businessmen such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he had won in Montreal to a mafia-linked middleman who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to the provincial parties, especially the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money supply, the prices of which were overpriced
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very vigorously.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in great detail before the commission: within ten years, he had received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for money-supply contracts, for which he was pushing the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they were paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiple jobs.
Martin Dumont, the organizer of the mayor's party, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of Riviere-des-Prairies in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of money spent on election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be launched, he says, he is "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the ant-free system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
She said the process was “painful but positive.”
We are in the stage of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to establish your own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot be returned.
It's like he's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "messengers informed of this deceit" if they did not get involved in these ploys!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, adding ironically, "I've heard it's just a weak decoction of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can no longer fall below it; if we boldly focus on the substance of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with more control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau advises all those who ridicule him to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You have set a whole new pace with PSG this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into themselves, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
It’s easier in matches.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the training at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up by degrees.
So you take advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This year’s teams are used to playing at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won many titles with top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think of the first season of PSG?
In the 1st League, Lyon took our front position.
But we're stuck.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the finals very easy.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough competitor for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Porto first so that we can play in the rematch of the eight-final at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has it...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
Today it is not so yet.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the chance to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think this year it will succeed.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also looking for the title, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, and there's still something in the paper that they blame us for, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what else people want from you.
You can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a play style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which hasn’t made it to the finals in its second season, and they’ve also invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you would expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
This is an insult to other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not very successful last season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how awesome the first league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
PSG seems to rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is "addiction to Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, and he's proving to be a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I couldn’t play as well as I would have imagined.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
I am also playing good games today.
This is what I have been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you view the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the World Cup.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire them to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don’t want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the tie (1:1) from October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often true with these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (however, convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is on the verge of about $10 (the overview of the exchange rates is presented on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin has been described as “the most successful virtual money,” “competing with the dollar and the euro,” and “the equivalent of regular money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used to advance in a video game, which one can earn through the game or which one can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, each month the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are current account book depositors, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the cutting-up stage of a file; i.e., the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers will "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then will they "chopping up" the whole thing.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second one will be abandoned, because each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to one hundred million, so there is room for margin here...
The difficulty of a given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and the stored bitcoins have been stolen.
“The loophole used is not related to the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payments company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors money laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players such as Wikipedia reject donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a ledger of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to authenticate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with merchants, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address, which can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move to more horizontal systems.
“It’s going to be a while before Bitcoin takes over, but 2013 could be a crucial year,” he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. forces are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people who suffered the most were the people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so do we, for we have lost 88 dead soldiers, and what about all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent aid from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air escort helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was on fire and in blood as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurity of these peasants, which was completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban all agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized government land that they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They have discredited themselves; most of them have never been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of America’s generosity leave: capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of war and its associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and its benefits intrigued them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million residents in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
Public schools are full of boys and girls.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they do not want to return to the obscurity of former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities who take the lead be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the struggle against the Soviet army are already reviving the provincial militias, which will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without resources to transport raw materials across the mountains, however, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site in order to retain their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French university departments, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to win the heart and soul" has been in operation, attempting the difficult task of harmonizing aid and military activities, in which the ministry of "citizen-military steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of achievements in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural reconstruction in dozens of villages thanks to the small French NGO.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of workable area.
What kind of memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural assistance from local communities in the Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from insurrections led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, in their words, to obtain little civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and affect them directly.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi has taken up the next round of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution granting it temporary unlimited powers, it has decided to play the vagabond.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has used a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "violate his word" and "undermines the law".
But his supporters say it is a means to tackle the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum will be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests sweep across the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end when the new constitution is approved.
And in this strange atmosphere yesterday, 85 deputies of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was promulgated, they slammed the door, saying that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 alternates were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further wondered that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some committee members held the view that the hours in the boardroom were not properly aligned.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains the same as the 1971 version of the Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rules", which would allow stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” argues the liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on al-Azhar University, particularly on issues of checking the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "persons called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
Liberals are even more concerned about the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains generally a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulams, but university workers, many of whom graduated from French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions in the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to the religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this."
The text approved yesterday is heavily criticized, in addition to religious sites, because of the expanded powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been severely curtailed compared to the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, proceedings with civilians will not be banned in military courts, as demanded by human rights associations.
These associations talk about their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the inviolability of nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bowing to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who enter this “bath” will receive God’s mercy.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here too Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will go through the Way of Pain, or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the anointing stone and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip around the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from an enemy that Herod the Great had built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can access it on their own.
Others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
The paintings of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented in his exhibition.
In Akkon you can visit the museum-spa Al Basha, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bath users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic sites in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
Cyan water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who can not swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and medicinal mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal the jagged nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
A famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city can be found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists love to wander through narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press on the walls in the aisle of "your" sign, luck will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators including Pontius Pilate.
Carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the trip, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city's main traffic is buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower town with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, which you can drive for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, work on markets, shops and public transport stops.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you get only kosher food: except for pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which there are a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
However, there are a lot of fattened cats that wander gracefully "to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats love populated places and are eager to indulge in every good thing.
The car will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - 15 dollars per day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "counterfeit" certificates
13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force under which every migrant worker will be required to pass an exam on knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal management, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of linguistic knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to people who successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between the Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law went into effect, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service respond - this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for non-professional emigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, Sebelev says with conviction, the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will secure a "password" to terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others like him will spend months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but upon arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," said Tolib Sharipov, head of the General Administration of Labour Migration.
Don't swear!
Even less so, since many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to go to, but they do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their misfortune: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, put on and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't be taking exams or getting any more official jobs.
In the meantime, most migrant workers are living illegally in Russia as before.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and this results in cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khuskadamov shared with journalists about his experience.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only migrants’ registration documents were fake.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of passing the language test.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of facilitating the problem of passing the tests, paid 7,000 rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times higher than the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in this agree government officials and human rights defenders.
Meanwhile, the government can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a course on the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legally held weapons is very low.
The MVD of Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the instigation of shootings at weddings, which were done without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which it is possible to obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by way of "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "nonsense tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC news agency.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior during the six months of 2012, while a total of 1168,000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons will not force the perpetrator to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept weapons orders
The first of them - "military or military route", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves stole weapons," Baranets said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" get for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires were set intentionally - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the manufacturers of weapons also contribute their contribution.
“There are now private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market and are decommissioning weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and automatons come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia has arisen that has organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have long been bought by no one - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the ensign, the candidate buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he will sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, so whenever their plan starts burning to clarify the crimes, they will make a control purchase from dealers with illegal weapons," the adviser added.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers usually find each other through their acquaintances.
I used to visit websites and blogs until a guy showed up and offered me the opportunity to go to the "Trial" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "nook" where we would negotiate with each other.
I found out the price right up there.
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman-advisor.
Sellers in the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that the daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He will also deliver them to me alone, because he knows that I will not betray him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a paper on the subject.
The scheme has not changed, according to him.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you thought of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, does not offer a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, simply do not buy - we go with the seller to the forest and to build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the gun is firing well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will take you to websites and groups on "Vkontakt", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
“It’s enough to have a set amount of money,” they write in the advertising headline on the website “Buy a Combat Gun or a Vending Machine.”
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the demand "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently unleashed a huge web of fake websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can rake with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description of where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Gun.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The right to a gun" you get a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period of January - October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, workers of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers will work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries that ordinary workers receive at Walmart and in fast food systems, the goal of protest organizers is to achieve in them the formation in their trade union organizations.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday" when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfing millions of residents and in some cases accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some of Walmart’s 2.2 million employees worldwide have left their workplaces and demonstrated alongside trade unions and left-wing activists from multinational chain companies whose goods are targeted at lower- and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart only shop at home.
The availability and range of goods has made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheap in part because they pay their employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a pay raise, complaining that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee receives $9.5 an hour, but this does not correspond to the amount of expenses, say the employees.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises its average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than the company currently spends on salaries.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should do virtually no harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday through midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its coffers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the union.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart department stores (those in the said progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, then doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and the regulations of the state of New York is 7.25 dollars per hour.
Fastfood restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their regular workers in New York City receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower salary.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents pass through the employment at "McDonald".
Few people see it as their main source of income or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet in an interview with "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sphere.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the establishment of labor unions and punishing labor movement activists with bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
However, introducing a trade union in fast food companies is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disagree
On that day, there were also loud protests in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The climax of the event was a rally at "McDonald's" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, most notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of servings, and then doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
Demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to come out together to support fast food workers so that they get the fair pay for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, though not all of them were fast food workers, employing tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become the spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
“The brain is deluded on average.”
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, the topic of augmented reality is popular; recently, this means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google unveiled a working model for the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for the patent.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory, Sharam Izadi, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in general what your research group is doing?
We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because the ability to control using gestures is very interesting for everyone.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow has not yet been improved separately.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
However, for this it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but is it not overrated?
- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about rampant ones, just about such cheap, short ones.
Gestures would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to spot.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - this is what we can reflect in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human motion is quite dynamic, and the current data rates of 30 frames per second are frankly a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made the touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human interaction with the machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
Three cameras are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a common visible-band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present their glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of reality extension, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display and around at any time on the basis of the cloud platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands feel nothing!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for imaging.
It records compressions in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tactileness to these "pictures in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time to come - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a goal, then the work is still for many years to come.
This is what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers - many things are in their prime.
Vkusovsky instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - the bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in the fashionable pubs and at the vernissages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the face of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
He recently took possession of a bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottler, as he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red instead of yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is slightly different from gray, arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky House of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of artists I couldn't understand.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonians who brought us to "Pushinska 10", and the other waves were not.
It attracts me to theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
- And all this merged in your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I took a place at Pushkinska 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
There was born many: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how the String was brought with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
String and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed in tight-fitting leotards, in the middle between them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, which started his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our regular and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 he organized a survey was in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, thus ending my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the topicality and sharpness is vividly captured.
I will have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is wiped away, the tragedy is taken away.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in the Order of Order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, they focus on the external mechanics, not on the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you have to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
We recently saw you play the role of the city's flaskman. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would it be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
In the past, people used to meet in groups, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-society, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
It's where the fans come in. It's where the sexual social sphere gets involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural scene and 10,000 will not come, and the result is less management, less money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will deceive them and violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on a collector’s wall together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money because of drawing pictures.
I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is the shortage in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: the actor through culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of proper tsars, this was not the case in all, the tsars may not have understood the culture much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are tucked away somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
Today, taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are different in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is culture much more, there is the right land.
And on our eel, art is doing poorly.
We need cultural soil, but there are more writers than readers in our country today, that's wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St.Peterburk grant
Birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board set out on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your genus in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I think the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
But while conditions on Mars are better for life, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problem of reproduction in the universe began with scientists with the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
After that, the insects were carried into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to test how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the trouble starts.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make somersaults.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had a complete loss of instinct.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they just died.
"We hatched the birds twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion", however, there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already pregnant.
In fact, they didn’t find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats gave birth to offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction in space has not yet been approached.
It's a difficult task.
With the loss of the usual environment, animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would last a flight into space.
If he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Vacnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of Svetlana Savicka, the second woman astronaut, was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, to whom after many years have been born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Humanity, however, must inevitably find new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for small children it is a natural element.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a child forget anything," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles wither very quickly, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
This can be left aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by the Earth's attraction, it cannot properly form a skeleton or a system of muscles.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
It will simply be deprived of what it absolutely needs for its development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP Bioethics Commission.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality and when the earthlings will go in their arks to a distant planet, which will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the SAO: Control of the squark system failed due to the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and high-quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is missing in our country," says Kala.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
He cites the approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called Švarcsystem as an example of malpractice.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it banned or allowed?
"The law must be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, even the prime minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to check and enforce obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then also practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the inspection is not yet finished, we have seen very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Efficiency means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by reducing the order limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Maybe the system will get overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You talk about domestic problems with the translation of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO there operates the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, it just forms in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices act similarly.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal system, it also has these courts of auditors at the level of individual federal states - in this the system differs somewhat from ours.
BRH can control only federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by our regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controls?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even the countries we see as role models are facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no use to them to cooperate with our office, would it not?
As for domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office?
Due to the fact that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet appeared in our control actions.
Because we do ex post checks, we have to expect a certain delay.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have started our new tool for "risk detection of waste", through which we have passed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem here may be that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does the law need to be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called "scratch system" - and what does that mean?
Is the svarcsystem disabled or allowed?
After all, the law must be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to do anything like that.
There are rather strict rules in the Public Procurement Act as to what is to be formally done - which is the right thing to do to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is missing.
The roads are frosty, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the roads are open, but with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning the roads were passable, but at times frosty and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the regional road traffic control.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads are now freely accessible in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remnants of frozen and sometimes run-away snow.
Especially at higher altitudes, you need to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
There is a risk of frost on some roads in eastern Bohemia, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate informs on its website.
Motorists warn drivers about frost, it can form especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice may be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to semi-clear with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a slight wind blowing.
The Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are accessible this morning, but in some places with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frosty.
The driver will also have to take into account the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the regional road traffic controllers.
The D5 motorway is accessible almost without restrictions, but caution is advised by the administrators of communication between 80 and 131 km.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be frostbite sections in the southern Plzeň and Tachov regions.
Communication of the second and third class is wet, and also in this case the warning of frosty sections applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count on the snow on the road.
After chemical sprinkles, it remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the way in the direction of the Videlský kříž.
Snow drove the roadmen into the terrain at night, snowing about three centimeters in the Šumperk region, according to the road managers.
In other parts of the region, the roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
"In the Šumperk region lies the remains of snow in the highest positions.
Drivers have to count on snow on the Červenohorský saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk road administration told the Czech News Agency today.
Their colleagues also set off into the field at night in Jeseníky, the roads up to and the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc area, roads are accessible without restrictions, but in the Šternberk region drivers should be careful in forest sections, where the roads remained wet.
Ústí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-drive places are reported this morning by roadmen in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or with an iceberg, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí nad Labem is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by roadmen especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for it at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night light and frost.
Unfavourable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border between the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees, which were bent to the road under the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think the end of the world will be in less than a month?
It’s just one of those scary things that people love to hear.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20, at 9 pm, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap along with other artists also sang a so-called anti-end of the world anthem called "End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be performed at all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymns will also be connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
He wrote the lyrics to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, he also sings Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and fun to work with.
What will be the benefit of the concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we have been carrying out for the sixth year with the Tap civic association in Jedličkova ústav.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly attended by lecturers and are engaged in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic actions" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the USA, would like to combine this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of disabled people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, her trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and tool boxes with us...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, ČSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in accessibility, public access to disabled people and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have seen that in the East everything is still in its very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move around the city center by himself.
There is no such thing as a wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civic associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what do we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
But it is important to mention that improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we are a bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but it’s only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let’s go back a few years, what made you decide to start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so together with my colleague I started a music club.
And over time, as our host Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But popularity has only come in recent years, am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that the work that cannot be seen, in fact, did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to get The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is overcrowded with things where one mimics the other.
In a way, it is logical, everything new is accepted carefully and takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural...
But that regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when something happens to people with disabilities, it’s not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Did being a strict boss, as many people have called you, also help this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, run out of medicine and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people leave and come, there is no way to prevent that.
Those who have the will and desire always have the door open.
It will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem will take place in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect via a telebridge while singing the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years old have free tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this European space agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, the journey of Poland to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, a lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering the Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listener cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for Entering Cosmonautics in France.
The mentioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
In 1925, a railway was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the train or to brake it.
Information about this Druze is known only from the period press.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to deal with rockets.
The research was provided by the Armament Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work of the Rocket - an air torpedo and air bomb by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Advisczo-Naukowy) was involved in all projects for the military use of missile technology.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended the beginning of the war.
After the war, other works devoted to space science appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951), and already in the autumn, PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch occurred on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with an access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bled desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next development type was supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C) were developed, differing in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, space was available with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket was carried out at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland’s accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is a price tension.
By this term it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer tries to compete with imports of cheap goods by "undercutting" the price of a competitor in order to pull a larger market share and thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditures of the state necessarily increase.
The whole situation is aggravated by the absolute unwillingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting their own populations at risk for private capital, regardless of the social downturn.
This is mainly reflected in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price diktat of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with a growing gap between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets in Germany for many years for the poor, who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that properly employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also reported in the case of the auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
Undoubtedly, the austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states lead to the same situation in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social level, are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century, or to languish for hungry wages on the fringes of society in the hope that private investment may one day come to the country.
But here we have to ask, where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian, or an African are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and the media have argued that the state cannot capitalize on its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists strongly on the opinion that the state must not interfere with the economy by controlling interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer, yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of funds, commission the drafting of draft laws to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power in this way does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type proclaim, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly coming into the situation described by Appianus in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have occupied themselves with violence.
For bribes, for the illicit acquisition of favors, and for the use of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote...Character people did not run for office at all, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls for eight months.....It began to talk about the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation was self-government, and that one had to choose an energetic man.
Conclusion As in antiquity, contemporary society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest regardless of the general social interest.
Private capital, by its very nature, is no longer able to understand and apply the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any attempt at reform of a deeper nature.
The causality of the rise of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be seen as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know them from ancient and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no war." -- Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been a lot of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue for the racism of the state of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killings and who the victims, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who has been served by the 95-year-long tension (counted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who guided their steps completely autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that might consider itself the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) as early as the 1890s to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts behind which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all of the world’s central banks and against countries where shares in the central bank are not being waged or prepared for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to reinstate Rothschild’s Bank of America, began issuing his own money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree of initiation, Albert Pike, between 1859 and 1871.
The first war had the task of abolishing the great monarchical states of Europe, the second was to abolish the colonial dominions of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and they do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a forecourt for such a solution), and the final assumption of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so as not to repeat the crisis they provoked in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in triggering the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by triggering the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II, the bankers of politics created a latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was to foist on the Germans a sufficiently strong, guilty, and simple solution offering the Fuhrer and the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke away from the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or whether everything he did was in the plan is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany’s war reparations for World War II, the establishment of the State of Israel created the focus of World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, like the latter, will be victims in the front lines of the struggle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s just consider how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, the international bankers only give the people their own candidates to choose from in the elections.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers, a politician who does everything possible to start a war with Iran, which, due to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to turn into a global conflict and, due to Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, threatens to destroy all of the world's oil.
As David Rockefeller put it in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The New World Order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
"And he compels all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have marks on their right hand or on their foreheads, that he may not buy or sell, who is not marked with the name of the beast or with the digit of his name.
This is to be understood: whoever has reason, let him count the numbers of the beast.
The number represents man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: Call Hollywood when it's worst
In November 1979, a crowd of protesting Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Réza Páhlavi, who after the revolution fled to the US, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would fundamentally threaten the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directing actor Ben Affleck's film Argo describes one episode of that history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was taken, six employees fled.
They ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who were watching the locations for the filming of the science-fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To be credible, the legend was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful stunt, a trick - an example can be the series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light-hearted passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -men in suits analyze the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director and his acting was no longer the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film not to take place in the director’s home town of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director’s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also manifests it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He works quite successfully with it, sometimes he thinks about reality - there everything does not work out so elegantly (the scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport is averted by the phone call in America and the chase around the runway seems quite far-fetched).
However, the weakness of Arg is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of its dramatic thrust, a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciating both the realization and retro style evoking thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to pull off.
As a reminder of a still somewhat vivid history, and a proof of how exaggerated are the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The website www.banknipołatky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to launch a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led by the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey, told Pravo.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women in life insurance prices have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include compulsory incorporation of bio-fuels, which is harmful to nature as a result, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the exclusion of classic bulbs from sale was also previously criticised.
Bananas should be at least 14 cm long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now also enforces the demands of its banks with a veto threat).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in length in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by harmonising existing disparate national standards that have complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU, despite opposition from some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the victory in the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the sold inflatable balloons must be warned that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to US research showing that balloons among toys are the leading cause of choking in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into fairgrounds.
Curious ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia for Greece due to the sensitivity of the subject and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, Bankpołatky.com nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State, in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU has set maximum amounts of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the prescribed volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of awarding subsidies at the request of receiving subsidies.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was grown in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, it was supposed to become full of warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic’s continued access to ports.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for the grant was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically they were to go to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easy to criticise in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to operate and develop the whole Union more effectively deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
For example, a more serious problem, according to experts, is the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs is also that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, and it will not always succeed in this struggle.
Although the Czechs, after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, defended the designation of Olomouc tvarůžky, domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed domestic.
Only cane distillate products and not sugar beet products may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parma ham have already found, for example, Carlsbad biscuits, mountain and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops.
The EU trademark can also be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořické tube.
"People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, what makes you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If this works in our country without any problems, I am not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being robbed for the last twenty years, the thieves running around, the taxes and the retirement age being raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm in my 40s and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you set off for the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for making my visions come true.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we curse in the pub and at the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this is the media, which denigrates man and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I bribed journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You went to the fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and returnable property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law for that.
As president, however, you do not have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for guidance to be a free trade, I managed to enforce it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they deliberately reject themselves, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party labeling and dogma I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It doesn't matter if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
I don’t care if someone belongs to the left or the right, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you'll only have passwords left.
You can’t do that in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that by going to people and talking to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in holding a televised broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality naming the bad guys, you can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I try to push things by myself, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was uncovering frauds with light heating oils.
I ran with the idea that people are really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did went mostly elected establishment officials.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have elected the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the clean past of every potential party member, and I don’t even have the money to do it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
Private property is estimated at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant towards women and at the same time fought against bad things and vices.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million in assets, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put much of your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign for.
You want me to go into debt?
I've spent 2.5 million dollars on this campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program is probably not that interested.
And I'm not obligated to pay for the campaign out of my own money.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I get for my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn’t live on it, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son for an English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to suppress these activities?
It has nothing to do with salary.
As I promised, I have partially downgraded my activities.
For example, my travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much were you used to taking per month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.

MVRDV’s architects are proof that real adventures don’t just happen in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 slides
"The building looks cheerful, futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder why we still need a library.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are going willingly anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own that are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was nothing short of staggering.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of insanely bold column charts and maker of witty, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at a competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his gifts on himself according to size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear Town!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was climbed for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which so far could not offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an extremely ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is thanks to this richer by a little contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: Eldorado reading under the cheese lid.
Although there is an elevator in the middle of the mountain massif, you will discover real spatial and reader’s passions only when conquering the topography on foot.
On all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cab and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, there are bookcases along the facade, and in the middle is a large dark space that is mostly awkward and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the space for the reader from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology exchange.
A special delight is the black book shelves, which are one wall paneling, one window sill, and another railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads over an unknown building material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
So one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years, a millimetre fleece of synthetic material has been used under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textile lasts one or two seasons and is then ripe for disposal in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed onto boards four centimeters thick.
Due to the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
There are 105 steps to get to the top.
At the end of a nearly 500-meter journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficuses in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every city dweller was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
First, optical gaps were to be filled in the previously not fully equipped library, which currently numbers 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This made MVRDV successful in the royal discipline, which is called identity formation in professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is, after all, the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from the vote on Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is teetering on the brink of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signalled that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza
But now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the creation of a no-fly zone.
It was eventually adopted by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that they are now changing their foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still settling in, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence attitudes in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to frighten the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
That plays a role anyway.
But I don’t want to give it too much importance, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German thinking.
Did Germany’s relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from both important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was for Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect from this.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, voted in favour of the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration has a secret understanding of the European position.
But, of course, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot be held publicly.
I think that differences of opinion are not really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all happy with Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection as long as they are not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will be able to enforce the law.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in protecting rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to register their marks.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and will register Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet with the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had its trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there. An artificial name that parasitizes even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different, and he is acting on behalf of his mandate to prevent Chinese companies from receiving the right to use a trademark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associate mark.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is tremendous."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from market research firm CLSA, China is the third-largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing.
However, deleting questionable entries in the register of marks can be difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
Driving can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch recounts cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the reproached name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
When the plaintiff has bad luck, he must still pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
There are also known cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete-mix pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, the company that bought the Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO admits that there were deficiencies in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the course of the labor process has returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
There are still 81,500 complaints pending.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive figures.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new applications worldwide.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that each login costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against it costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The company has been fighting Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
Although the Germans achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts was canceled.
However, the counterfeiter has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget about it ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg claimed the right, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archive, they even had to look through 100-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "high six-figure amount in euros" in vain to settle the dispute.
"You can see what that means for us," Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East is also threatening Europe.
This is the case when imitators secure unprotected tags.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to sign up for the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since been abandoned by the company, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and attorney Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners should "enroll everything that is worth protecting in any way, even in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the label in the final act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay royalties to the opposing party for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying out - and in Swaziland, the orphans of parents who have died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there’s the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women’s pumps and men’s loafers look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - are pressing, mumming and prosecuting each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost picks it up from his textile shoes when he joins his voices with his gently wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
There were fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from human genetics researcher to caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different lyrics and even in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Program, estimates that there are about 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents died of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
For the 180 orphans of their parents who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, patronage can be taken.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "one who praises" in Zulu.
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space, only sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been rehearsing the songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the strength of the voices of the German corps.
40% are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni you can see in the small, thus stagnant whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity in them. It is no rarity that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the "Voices for Africa" congregation was founded, which has since taken care of orphans from parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What Are the Most Serious Sexually Transmitted Diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Cucumbers and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is among the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of newly infected people are HIV-positive.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
The number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of STDs?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
The danger of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partly transmitted by infection from impurities and by close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
“We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
He also takes care of orphaned children to find shelter, for example, at one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in Zulu, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads and make sure that the children arrive on time every day in their uniforms for school.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to take an HIV test.
Although the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
The King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's pretty weird in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immoderate lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To support cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi choir travels around South Africa once every two or three years and sings songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on the maps, it is more than famous in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say there.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra?e, you can see that the light is shining here as well.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimetres and possibly up to 20 metres thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not put the finding of ice in the context of the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how water and other essential elements of life got to other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by Earthlings, take part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new conceptual definition from 2006.
This cut-out from the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, less identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" at the star's birthing hall.
This region where stars form - scientists call it non-romantic W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The domed ring consists of material that the star spewed out during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
A photograph of the galaxy's "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible at night to the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, the colors are better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the terrestrial continent has earned this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of the unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to capture in full beauty the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, three-clad), because the dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadon, astronomers have photographed the foreshadowing of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies collide and must inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Windmill.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a cutout of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
This 1,400-light-year-old nebula is composed of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring from a black hole 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was detected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are still giving birth to young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been getting bigger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, its diameter is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive method of construction: the telescope is secured with a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is a high amplification of light flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is comparable to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any owner of a computer that will make its computing power available.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here - honoring its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also shine through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to be full 42 meters and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted at the earliest in 2018.
Two of Keck's telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a thirty-meter diameter of the mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard the Ariane 5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger spacecraft, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
A ride in the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus rumbles along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and plain country houses.
Everything is green and juicy, we almost seem to be in the Black Forest.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Talysh ethnic group of the Caucasus lives, of which little is known, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live to a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"The Eurovision Grand Prix was celebrated in Baku in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the life of almost eight dozen Talysh people from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old, is documented.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he fathered a child.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is sheep herder ?irali M?sl?mov, who is said to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with papers was 122 years old, M?sl?mov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he reportedly still fathered a daughter.
Wasn't it a few decades later that ?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the age-old people in Central Asia.
“Obviously, many elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of supporting documents, no scientific proof of age can be given, especially when the registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik live to see the biblical age noticeably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with special Talysh genes.
The director of the Fatulieva museum, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy does not seem to be particularly plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzajeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
He sits on the ground with a butterpot, which he tirelessly cradles.
Eight people live under the same roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
There are also two small children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical abs of the "armada".
Mirzajeva’s white teeth form a perfect line and hide long dark blond braids under the scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn’t look like it and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzajeva.
A monthly pension is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in a supermarket in my life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was in World War II.
But everything improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that surrounds the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) every month. This is a sum that can be used well for living here.
And maybe even the long-greyed son of Mirzaeva is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless there's a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The term “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Clashes in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep divisions.
A future constitution based on sharia law is being heavily debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that, I am responsible to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
All of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a "God-State" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said he had temporarily limited the powers of the constitutional court and expanded his powers to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, really wants to save is unclear to the Egyptians and the world.
Should the judiciary be stripped of its power?
The 234 paragraphs that the 100-headed Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly Islamists, hastily passed in a 15-hour night marathon are partly of concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the legal space attached to it for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is explained by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise supervision over the legislation, which would bring about the de facto withdrawal of jurisdiction from the judiciary.
There are many interpretations in the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and support its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature using this paragraph.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
After all, no paragraph defines the explicit equality of men and women in writing.
However, another section prohibits defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what the defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the wording that it is forbidden to "insult people".
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough in this case?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for a popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, opposition to Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual concord at Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening and pledged to destroy the constitutional charter before it goes into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "in the dustbin of history".
Through a short message service, Twitter accused supporters of Morsi of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition member Yasser Said said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali said in a statement.
Several judges said they did not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Koran is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared rebellion, but not out of prudence in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They urged Morsi: "Cleanse the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably trigger a civil war-like state.
Clearly, Morsi’s supporters didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which is actually supposed to continue until February and integrate all social forces, hafez Abu Sa'du rules.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and head of Egypt’s Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in jail or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now there are no words 'human rights' even once," he complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norway: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for an exceptionally smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
This will give you the sense of paralyzing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s greatest delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and in the air hangs a ubiquitous smell.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Raqfisk general", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
A drink can make the smell go away.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it’s not that bad - it’s similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were no doubt numbed by alcohol.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high wages and a large-scale care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival that until recently was much richer than Norway, are pouring into the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, though rather stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often not in the news around the world - and this seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still grudgingly mentioned here.
Instead, the shooting is called "the July 22 event".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries of the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," our waitress Anna, with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, said as she served the plates to the rakfisk.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway is very careful about its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the cords on their purse tightly tightened.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinky fish is back.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which the presenter with a bow tie is surrounded by plates with a rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavite.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been doing well economically during the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grips of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader differ even in his old homeland, the populous and sprawling state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
Now you can drive to the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MP for President Pen Nieto's Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected of Enriqua Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a person with no substantive content.
He is a very straightforward man, very biased with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most of all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the self-governing municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help handle drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge garbage dump.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the problem of female murder while in office.
In the worst case, they accuse him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body,” Buendia recalls.
There were signs of trauma and postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is a single word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, troublemaker and whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and omissions have occurred," he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make his time in office a priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," Olvera told Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of abusive treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of mistreatment of Manning in prison.
He is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of leaking the largest classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the abusive treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had had with unit officers during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia did not show any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing conducted at the suggestion of the defence to dismiss the case brought against Manning on grounds of ill-treatment at the time of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed through forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning at Quantico's detention facility, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly asked Manning about how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various problems orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be addressed, but did not note these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 at a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that in the course of this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The military said it used the restrictive regime (one degree under suicide surveillance) to protect it and keep others safe.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and once fainted there because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very daunting.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, slip-ons, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the regulations.
Manning stated that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about the charges he made in Thursday's deposition, alleging that after being forced to sleep one night in his Quantico cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
During Friday's hearing by the judge, Manning stated that he had decided, by order of his guards, that he had a blanket that he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because he had tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his slips to hurt himself, but did not.
Manning testified that his underwear, his slips, and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before a military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans to plead guilty in lower crimes and that it will fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmitting information related to national security, and stealing public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So I ended up calling it "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can’t get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
They had the usual issues on the agenda that get discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to join with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to transfer half of Mexican territory to the United States under threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, reminders are ubiquitous.
So, a minute after a U.S. official says something a little critical about Mexico, you’ll hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on the warpath.
Yet the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seemed, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not with Mexico.
And while we now live the American dream, go to good schools, and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they see us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only a failure.
If our families in Mexico had not failed, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make things even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and pressuring political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disgusted at the way their family members have been treated in the much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
An end to the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such event is futile.
Among the usual useless guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets fell from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even as Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even bloodier than it's ever been.
However, there are reasons to think that it can break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there does not seem to be much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire closed on November 21, the fighting this week strengthened hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently run by its staunch rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained more influence, making Hamas powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic crescent surrounds Israel, in the north from Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s party/militia rules, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Above all, in the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out either by Israel or by America.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back into the crate.
Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth, and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the latest round of violence.
Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, thanks in part to a wall that encroaches on the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, would they not launch missiles, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of Palestinians' rights to self-determination is creating a powder keg that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is worsening the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, which take place every few years to push back Hamas, will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers say: two states when Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that stopping the fire will give outside pressures at least a little more leverage to push this thing through.
Egypt, which must work with Turkey and Qatar to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the 1967 border-based Jewish state with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than offer virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a hand in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This is a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the laws on ugly cigarette packaging came into force
Unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, show warnings for smokers and diseased parts of the body.
Australia’s ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws came into force, the first of their kind in the world, and the brand’s logos and colors were replaced with generic olive-green boxes with hideous pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns getting sick as a result of their parents’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, since Saturday, the only difference between the boxes are brand names that are printed in the same small font.
This is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding the habit of its attraction.
It relies on studies to show that if people don’t start smoking by age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
"Even very young children can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for silicone cigarette packs to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal of the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stock.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible setback, experts cite the popularity of social media with the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a marketing professional in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is the unsurpassed place you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman has seen an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Honza".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put in the work and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims the industry has focused on how it will handle the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected to be delivered in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take out a cigarette and put the box back in," says Victor El Hage when buying the box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in central Sydney, says the single boxes make it harder for him to line up on the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, let's close the store,'" he said, throwing his hands around.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines, and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly praising boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our kids) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen nowadays, we have no chance to enjoy boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription relating to boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and demonstrating the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me but I was unable to do it".
Boredom is distinguished from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there is no urge to do anything in apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "disrupting the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and the feeling of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on a factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and doodleing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to fidge are more likely to learn and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the buzzing speaker, the particularly lengthy film.
Some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally inert.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which nearly 400 teenagers and their parents were contacted seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that "growing up is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will no longer be bored, but he will not learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain themselves, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of it either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There's No Guide to the New Marijuana Act in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state - possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug-using equipment - minor offenses for which there is a $100 fine for each - and was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado’s vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offenses have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for possession of small amounts that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have said they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and are still blaming people for the possession.
At the same time, several cities in the Denver suburbs towards the western mountains are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their municipalities.
"This issue is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scrambling.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington state liquor licensing board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow," he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will still be no state licensing system, but legal possession does.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the city's prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana by any citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would "immediately" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue prosecuting marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face additional charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Mr Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer blame adults for possession of small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials in light of this large state green experiment.
For district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will comply.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients who use it, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to knock the door on a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to proceed.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved moratoriums on any new marijuana deals, though it will take about a year before any store can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that it will enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we get a big federal deal out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We look at what the people voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
It is not just university students who are being challenged for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern-day wrapped Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
At the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson has eloquently stated that I left because I was forced to drink from battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I’m bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center are suffering similar persecutions.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protections for equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Younger Years Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and made to feel unwelcome".
They call for the creation of a position on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their views are freely communicated.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which portrayed conservatives as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit, and had a cane with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as "scapegoats" because of the introduction of higher tuition.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people to the right of the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority about one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most ferocious.
A year earlier, the university had voted against awarding the honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in higher education funding.
Even the Stalinists would shudder from the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students were meeting with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the taunting of conservative pupils, but they are also eager to participate.
A policy of mining strike, privatization, and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was brought into the wood-covered auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very bile.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students nodded.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room in shock.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a sophomore named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who (what an irony) attended Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students talked to him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
For three years they have developed before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettiness, and for its leaning toward a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His eyes widened.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of my teaching, when another history professor declared in absolute seriousness that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed with shame inside, I admitted that my "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Conservative Prime Ministers, but also, to this day, hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition by Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which presents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, which, however, could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is brimming with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian elite".
Loving the royal family is not a bad thing.
"At least they don't put a cigarette in a great carpet, like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
He’s still a star.”
Valeria Mazzova shows off Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentinian model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he was reflected in everything and his spirit was felt.
He made all those invited feel important and loved,” recalls the top model who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
A show of nobility
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of love reciprocated.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage offering a role exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "audience" of dreams that Valentino's masterpieces wears as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vittiah wore from the "Noci" coat, or the "Noci" coat that the Emperor wore.
The audience of the mannequins includes names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget him".
“I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others because of his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria said in a statement.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give a "sparkle" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget how she first dressed Valentina.
Growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a ruffled skirt, a ruffled bodice, and a strapless top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax with fashion, his passion is timeless," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in themselves".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul the Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a siding four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority on the specialized press, these dresses represent a landmark of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-Etre" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his chosenness, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
“The last time I saw him was at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
It was perfect, time left no trace on it."
If the princess says so...
The world's toughest trade: the sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to tow to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases leak from the interior of the Earth and when in contact with the air it passes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted carriers to climb at a turtle's pace upwards, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they are upstairs, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and they tire of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
PT Candi Ngrimbi has been mining the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for making matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even sugar bleaching.
"Because it's common to carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is ruined at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it seems like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros), " explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's not breathing well, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, the sulfur of which has already begun to take its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's got bad breath, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man afflicted by fate could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, and instead does the work of a porter.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other bearers and gets up every day at 2:00 a.m. because sulfur does not cease to flow at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the darkness, Anto rides into the crater and lights his way with a small flashlight attached to his helmet and buys it with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanised sulfur mining due to cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) in the photography surcharge, which along with a 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) ticket is collected by nature park guards from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” says Madrusin, a sturdy 42-year-old who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since he dropped out of school.
He is able to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will keep working "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes coming out of the volcano, the miners are so insistent that none of them complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain, and shoulder wounds caused in the knuckles.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which three trucks then transport on a steep path between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik said, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, he is also the oldest, thirty-year-old, earning by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's toughest crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts that are carried out by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame having no children on career, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an advert for menthol candy, but still - or maybe just because - the video spread massively on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local cues such as "put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of Singapore's birth rate.
Advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way with this ad.
The agency's art director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do "their civic duty."
“It’s just an internet thing, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things, like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who does not take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore due to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just about marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has generated resentment among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and little effort at integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's governing party recorded its worst electoral result since independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policies, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of developer EL Developers, says their “shoeboxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular by selling them days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That’s why they’re so much better for our cash flow.”
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in a financial district in the city centre suggests they won’t have much effect.
"People are always stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why many people put it off," says the young official.
“Let the others have children.
But for me it is important to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force its citizens to have children, it is still Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any intrusion.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he posts things on the Internet that he certainly would not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" on a personal level and a "user name and password" when it came to social networks.
“I wouldn’t disclose my biggest secret,” Jorge, 10, says in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
“I’m putting pretty pictures on FB, or pictures of us playing.
I also talk to my friends there.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked persons or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of the friends he has on Facebook and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I created a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits he doesn’t know 20 people from his friends list.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them were encouraging him to do anything, nor did they ask for his address or phone number.
“If they push me or require me to do so, I will simply remove them from my account,” he said.
José logged on to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he confirmed.
According to Jose, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You've just activated a private regime."
It then explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of finding information, but when social networks emerged, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it".
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do something doesn’t work,” he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted your friend’s?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag the people in the party photos, did you ask permission from them?
Does everyone always need to know what you’re doing?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and it should be the same on social networks,” he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-grade teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read the rules of social networks carefully.
“If they understand every trick, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that setting up an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
South American Summit Ends and Lima Declaration Not Published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the Lima Declaration being issued, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at Unasur's sixth meeting of heads of state and government, but representatives of both the State Department and the presidential office, who initially set out to publish the document after the summit ended, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peru's President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "Confidential session, audio transmission prevented".
A small amount of the information available to journalists was provided by the press spokesmen of some governments who were present, but not by Peruvian spokesmen.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, prompting a backlash from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency e-mailed the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is only President Humala's statement, and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, despite being eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but completely blocked the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chile's President Sebastián Pisera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the two sides' defence speech on Monday to discuss the dispute that Lima has initiated against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts,” he added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would comply with the ruling of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia accepted the Bogotá Pact this week, thus expressing compliance with the rulings of the International Court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the ruling entirely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with starting the morning speeches and concluding the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read a final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and activity was planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements, he said that UNASUR member states would take “important steps toward the goal of South American citizenship, for which residency agreements are being expanded.”
He said actions were being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve drug availability and the cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation is not meant to be a victory, but to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” Humala said.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," he said.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two more relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said ahead of his attendance at the regional meeting that he hopes to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice ruling on the maritime border dispute being contested by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday for the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieta.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth South American Union of Nations (Unasur) presidential summit in Lima, told state TV Perú that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he advocated a project to create South American citizenship, which Unasur member countries support.
“Freedom of movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community must be achieved, however, there are still backward areas that want to return us to the past,” he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed to a regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights are taken into account.
"Those in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States," he said in reference to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles, and he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system, which asked him to be questioned in Swedish territory over an alleged sexual offence, with "Sweden's own legislation allowing the interview to take place by videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he is at risk of getting worse physically and mentally because he is confined in a small space with no possibility of movement in the fresh air.
It would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the settlement of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate on human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said: "If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Mr Assange is heard by Sweden at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without any problems and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be put to an end."
Correa took advantage of the situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, making it clear that he certainly does not tolerate "underaverage, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, vile and depraved politicians, but bad journalists at the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie control Ecuador, and he announced that if he was re-elected, he would "continue to make changes along the right path and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay over Unasur union membership until at least her next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism shrouded in legality" because it in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, Ecuador's president said he considered it "completely appropriate" to wish his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the wake of the ruling by the International Court in The Hague in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is not accepted at this time.
“This is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which he is resolving in the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries pledge to accept the judgment, however harsh it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has stated that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
“I personally have never been interested in power, but situations as unfair as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last term as president and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, it's the same for me.
I have already made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
“I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chávez has left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador attended the sixth summit of the heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he recounts, recalling a moment of truth the doctor was trying to "soften up a bit," but apparently without success.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to learn about it, and with such a commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several struggles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options, and more stigma.
At the time, the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute's (IMSS) clinic did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive and live fully with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and debilitated the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS first appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, “significantly succeeds that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara, with this information being confirmed in an April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells can live up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems up to 75 years while adhering to the treatment," the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the death toll has fallen significantly in recent years and the number of people dying from AIDS in Mexico has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this May. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die as a result of the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it's happening at the hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, in the late stage of the disease."
He adds: “Nine out of ten patients come when a co-infection has occurred. The only thing that needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it.”
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco, as well as patients such as Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory just because a friend of his had done it, and despite his young age, he has already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’d rather go out three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO daily, so that today, as part of the World AIDS Day, he will motivate those who are afraid with his testimony.
"Let them take the test. If they've taken the risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
His message sums up the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who researches information on the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are doing this task, "there has really been an increase in the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question filled with irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees, and medical personnel who teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, not just behind the counters, but in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not promiscuity.
Nor is it about "paying for beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distributing condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead a sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
In Mexico, the condition ranks fourth in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease per registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognise Grupo Vitro’s bankruptcy debt restructuring in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national business with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
So it seems that the procedures for restructuring companies, which are allowed by Mexican law, do not apply in the land of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the verdict issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hal at the bankruptcy court for Northern Texas leaves Mexican companies without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the United States Supreme Court with an appeal against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge of this case claims that creditors should abide by the United States Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would show ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created to determine the organization of the American Law Institute by an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment provides that without the voting of the branches from the internal corporate structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for approval of the restructuring would not have been reached.
However, Mexican law allows for this.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose in-house debts the Federal Insolvency Institute vouched.
Furthermore, it is true that even after subtracting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who stood against Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of the "suppos" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergenceia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of the severe economic crisis that has struck the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm González Sady will file an appeal for a new assessment directly with the Court of Appeal so that the assessment takes place in full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, as only three originally voted.
If it fails here, it will seek review of the process by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is significant about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae detailing Vitro’s bankruptcy procedure and pointing out that the company had eased itself by adhering to the agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it is pointed out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall Rating
Unnoticed on the table for several months was a criminal complaint from the Mexican aviation union against former owner of the business Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, and according to the union of pilots, the container had already overflowed.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in the pursuit of justice.
According to her, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor’s Office about the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which it collected 198 million pesos from IXE bank from fideicomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican aviation company.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azcárraga Andrade is known to be the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens met over the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as is well known, about a huge trade and distribution center with products from the "big wall country" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which at the bottom would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) had managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA
The Senate’s request, which was not taken into account by the government and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English acronym ACTA, has become obsolete, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As we know, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, the developer Homex is giving out 500 million pesos worth of investment certificates to the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competition is born.
The merger of leading companies in information technology, such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, gave birth to an association with the trade name Competition, whose goal will be the software services market in Central and South America.
Investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in the sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior, BSN National Basketball League player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón National Basketball League team, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation, before being caught in a wheelchair stroke in 2008.
“I’ve played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest movement of all, he guards those that commemorate his time in los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed it the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
The team was then taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, saying to me, 'I've got a tall two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to point guard Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory in the championship, then Gauss will contribute to the next one."
The championship, when for the team los Vaqueros played Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we were supposed to have bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian umpire who let us repeat the final throw in," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and blew out the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
That team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López, and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also there were the youths (Javier) "Tocito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had a perfect line-up but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualifiers in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players eliminated due to a skirmish in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt the Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his involvement in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the guys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, referee assistants and referees.
I'm glad.
What do you do now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, is world renowned for starring John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died, according to an official family announcement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon from complications associated with cancer.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved best," the family said in a statement.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in a Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before Dallas, Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in NBC's light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that were only broadcast briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His acting in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the emotionally charged episode when Hangman's character is nearly murdered, caused not only a huge amount of speculation by viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in betting offices.
It also helped this piece achieve a record in viewership.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a crafty businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked up in a rehab center.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his headstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of season two have already been completed and a sixth has just been filmed," the network said in a statement.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classic works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck in the New York theater scene and then served in England with the Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew would hurt anyone or hurt them in any way," he told the Prensa Asociada news agency.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital helping fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they go into surgery and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, due on December 21, had caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what lay ahead for him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gulf that some call the "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, the place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When a person discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for the apocalyptic mind.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker holds a course on "Resources, Culture, and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas spread over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
"I've been trying to inform students about what's possible, likely, plausible, and impossible," Vacker says.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple name The End of the World.
"We're not adding '2012' because we're always counting on the opportunity to re-arrange the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatened doom", students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He stretched out into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, of which 35 applied.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Therefore, apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour where it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But none of the students interviewed, let alone the professor, said they believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prediction and we are somehow disproving it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, with people reacting to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The rise of this speculation was caused by the internet.
“People don’t think about it anywhere else,” he said.
This is true in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who lectures this year in the Philippines, when asked if he knew of any course on “the end of the world” there, answered quickly.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception at the top office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment have been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by both students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
“I think I’ll call a few friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
