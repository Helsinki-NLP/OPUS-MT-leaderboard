Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will receive a diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which in October selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to win it in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that he is taking over the award as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased even more by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to give it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
A packed program will take the president and his wife to a banquet where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a prime minister and 250 other invited guests.
Obama has been reluctant from the start.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Environmentalist Accused of Blackmail
The Litomerice police accused the chairman of the society of nature conservation Litomerice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit to withdraw the appeal, said Litomerice police spokesperson Alena Romová.
The chairperson of the Society of Nature Conservation in Litomerice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you can meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
Take a few minutes to find the right garbage.
I don’t want to say that there is no waste at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that for the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only because as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the bin?
It's a big deal, it just takes time and nerves.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefená Husa.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't seem like much.
Not to mention that in other parts of the waste sorting there is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to waste.
Laziness.
It is far from garbage.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful trash cans on Kounicova street.
Fortunately, I came across the right place on the way to the shalom.
However, the waste flowed from it.
After all, this is still the centre of Brno, which probably represents the city the most, right?!
But the ecology and aesthetics of the Brno socialists are not very interested.
They would rather buy the city hockey extraliga, which will disgrace us all over the country, than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick
After the left has added farmers or officials despite the government’s opinion, there may not be money for pensions, sick leave or building savings in the budget.
But also on interest on national debt or on international litigation.
This will add to the problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists pushed for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow on sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just postponing problems for the future, laying mines," says Janota.
Borrowed money pays more and more interest and sometimes has to be returned.
There is no choice where to go, the state has no choice.
If they do not reduce welfare or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all those to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick leave, they get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted, next year will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity pay, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money for the benefit of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
It is mainly about the already competed and built sections, which can not be re-designed and possibly discounted.
At most, to preserve, which is also not free.
It means delaying or stopping 30 large buildings, and the use of European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD suggested that the loss of money would be solved in Solomonic - it would reach into the dividends of ČEZ, which the state owns for the most part, and from them it would top up the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, let alone a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came out of the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, they supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, under EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
But the carnival does not end there.
Almost three billion were lost in the budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, as well as expenses for litigation, even building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, touch on the government’s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already-launched two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is supposed to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending on.
The first phase starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware aims to do, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We allow you to manage two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Bare slopes do not only worry the Krkonoše lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, check the prices, but so far they are afraid to make binding orders.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be on snow or mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to their wishes should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is second only to him, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Špindlerův Mlýn hoteliers offer mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll give in and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabí.
I am most interested in Christmas, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer the travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first 14 days of February are also good for sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Krkonoše Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also sell out,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snezkou are slightly better than last year.
We're about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last few places.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in the town.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the other hand, at Christmas, half of the beds in the newest Janskolázeň hotel remain free.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have about sixty percent occupied.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger portion of the snow, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let their appetite go.
Thursday should be cold, if there is any precipitation, then the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec department of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it through a copier from Bush’s Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward".
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, which was plagued by civil war, as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
However, the months that followed showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only one possible and so successful that the news reports today do not talk about Iraq at all.
It didn’t improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting point than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was once again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination practices harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better came of it, so at least he defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he managed to squeeze out the promise of another 5,000, although he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in just 18 months and to end the process in three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their masters on a daily basis, are poorly prepared.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to thrive.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the opacity of the situation, which further complicates Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of exploding.
Believing that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for the purpose of "early return home" will cause a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is going to a minus.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically interfering in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there will be a difficult question for the United States whether or not to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election, and therefore enough time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs Managers Will No Longer Receive Cash Rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash payments this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for spending nearly $17 billion on rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The company’s total compensation for this year is expected to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to impose a 50 per cent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
Today in Stockholm, a record five women received this year’s Nobel Prizes in professional categories and for literature from Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to the four women scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Muller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research on chromosomes.
The Chemistry Award went to Ada Jonath, an Israeli, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their clarification of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics went to Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
The award was presented today by Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
The figure for each category is 10 million Swedish kronor (roughly 25 million CZK).
If there are more than one of them, they will share the reward.
The most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, because he is only at the beginning of his career and moreover, he is the leader of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defense of his policies, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to win peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and maybe even Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was announced by the president’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota plans to hold talks with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus will now sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
But on Wednesday, the House approved proposals from the left to move money and raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of social democracy of secretly increasing the budget deficit.
On the one hand, the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, have created a sharp internal political dispute, which raises a question mark over the further operation of Fischer’s official cabinet, which the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially liquidating a package of austerity measures that the Fischer government pushed through in the fall and which it says is meant to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the bill, said at a business breakfast today that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem" of "unsustainable deficits" in public finances for a long time.
He no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also be based on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was scary and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements".
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year will exceed CZK 200 billion.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also pleased.
Mandel was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novel.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the abolitionist movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in The Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
“I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that when I pressed your hand, I was taking over your energy, transferring, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon stars in the film as Francois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look a lot bigger in a movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real counterparts under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words, "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: the Russians tested the missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry just admitted yesterday that it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black nightmare of both Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during the missile tests did not have a proper effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually did not fly at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, the "Bulava" is referred to as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was the 13th attempt in the series that started out as normal.
It was only at the end of the flight that the technical damage to the apparatus occurred again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows you to launch from a moving and submerged vessel.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a malfunction of the "Bulava".
From the first moment, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that one cannot speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch was without fault, only six out of thirteen were considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
The almost 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, so they still claim that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be back in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably start in Friday's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov was quoted as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Nemtsinov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional ice hockey player.
At the age of 51, legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford all season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world titles, and won both the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai agrees to cancel all overtime
Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is crucial, that is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will also receive it on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either have the surcharge paid for overtime or they can choose a substitute holiday on December 28 and thus extend their Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive a paid fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees were forced to work an additional two hours of overtime almost every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
Further negotiations between the company and the unions are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike readiness.
The carmaker's situation escalated last week, with about 400 employees spontaneously striking overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The union also demanded that workers who discontinued production last Wednesday should not be penalized by any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions require the company to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns this year.
Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production in November last year.
By September this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even on 'tough' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the University of Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metal-carborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalcarbonates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal-carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages made up of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatments make metal carboranes interesting compounds for further research leading to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight over the budget. ODS went after Fischer, he defends himself
Mirek Topolánek, the head of the ODS, called the approved budget for next year “terrifying” and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He said he has time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
The Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to lean on the minority in the House, which is fighting the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has raised money for civil servants' salaries, for running social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
The government’s objection to the proposals of social democracy was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
ODS left the hall before the vote, meeting the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke about disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments had been adopted, the situation might have been different.
According to Czech Television, Janota booked a meeting with the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering continuing in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget.
If Fischer is in favour of further fighting the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the ČSSD nominees, who pushed through the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the Staff Act.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the ODS were not guilty
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in the deputy positions claiming to be TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of fighting the level of the public deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
But he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is topical, I will deal with it, said Martin Barták, the Minister of Defence, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister ODS
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the prime minister of the Civic Democrats MPs did not explicitly request that they allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not burdened by the absence of the party chairman in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the bolshevization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare.
From 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less busy express trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The overall traffic coverage will be reduced by 2% from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, residents of Ostrava will get more options to connect to the capital, the tracks will add one pendolino set to this track.
On the contrary, the fast train will stop travelling to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connection Prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in transport in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today they have to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava via Pendolino on 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays for the express trains, it will give the railways CZK 4 billion to cover the so-called demonstrable losses next year, as it did this year. The locals order the regions, they will pay CZK 8 billion in total next year, while the state will contribute less than CZK 3 billion to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The tracks have a new ten-year contract for locals and expressways, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they did not seem to raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will be made only for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška Internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the eLiška will be based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to CZK 160.
Filipino militants still detain more than 50 people, release children
Gunmen kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 people kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a live shield while fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnapper because of the violence, which required settling accounts between two local family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governorship were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this Jihofilipina province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
On Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film Invictus (official title in Czech: Invictus: Undefeated) will be released in American cinemas, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela had chosen for his portrayal years ago.
The role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, it emerges from the reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations as it comes to the public at a time when South Africa is both at the peak of its preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media is shaken by worrying news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the black ruling majority.
According to The Associated Press, responses to the new film in South Africa so far have been largely positive, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles by "fancy" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to, as they say, draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind Mandela of his personality and his message.
It’s the story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on the book by British author John Carlin, In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made the Nation portrays a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries to unite two racially and for many years mutually defined groups of the population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the South African national rugby jersey on the field of the World Cup, which was won by South Africa at the time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a large ovation from a predominantly white audience for his entrance into the turf in a jersey that is considered almost sacred in South Africa and earned the recognition of the white population.
The World Cup may bring people back together, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A tens of millions of crowns transformer is burning in Louny
In the morning, the fire caught the transformer of Čeps in the substation near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the Ústí Region firefighters, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, firefighters wanted to burn the transformer, but later they reconsidered the opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, the internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, a spokesperson for the company, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, and it will not be accurately quantified until after the fire.
According to Mandátová, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of operation of Čeps, nothing similar has happened, the defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to ČEZ spokesperson for northern Bohemia Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, the power supply has not been interrupted, and the operation of households, offices or companies has not been affected by the transformer station fire.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and the route of the line with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three ČSSD governors
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation of three social-democratic governors.
This is true of Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in 20 minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some counties.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about the fact that we choose raisins, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnálu.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all the regions that they had not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers filing a criminal complaint as a continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend the good name of my country and my country, and I will also call on other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will alert regions about the disadvantageous move.
He told Radiožurnálu that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after New Year.
He said the campaign would be waged against corruption as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with České dráhy and did not issue tenders for around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur was also threatened by a member of parliament for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we might lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnálu today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccinations will break old habits from January.
It should be free for families and optional at the same time.
However, there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at its peak.
The Institute of Medicine has already set maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Experts are already clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccinations
Free Vaccines for August Children
From January, children born last year on August 2 and later can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier will have to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid $1,600 for one or more doses.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccinations.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 per year for all vaccinations for children.
Paid vaccinations were introduced by the so-called Janoto package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the membranes of the brain and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country in a year, according to the survey in hospitals up to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced pneumococcal vaccinations for children in about 40 countries.
Will vaccinations be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association, indicated that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference attended by our association were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
We are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that’s the path we need to take now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for pneumococcal vaccination.
At the moment, we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Worsen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hana Cabrnoch, chair of the Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first widespread vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving the team on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of general practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some members of parliament feared that this would allow insurance companies to “take money out of health insurance”.
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
It is estimated that children’s doctors will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'steals in a museum'
Frank Frazetta, the son of famed American filmmaker Frank Frazetta, was accused of attempting to rob $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., aged 81, became famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated to act by long-running family disputes.
Before police, Mr. Frazetta made a younger sworn statement, aged 52, that he had done so at his father's instruction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to move the paintings to the malting premises", as the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax hike
The ministers advocated increasing taxes and cutting spending, as announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling stated, the Tories "wasted" the opportunity to show that they were serious about postponing the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
Even the chancellor came under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger about Social Security
Unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not cause and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is on the rise - an increase of around ?3 trillion a year - which has outraged a community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax, while there should be a focus on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to those incomes of more than GBP 20000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social Security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% bonuses of bankers
1% increase in corporate tax for small businesses
Tax Cuts for Electric Vehicles and Wind Power Plants
Increase pensions by 2.5%
According to the State Financial Administration's estimate, some incomes of GBP 30000 are reduced by GBP 90 per year, and some incomes of GBP 40000 are reduced by GBP 190, while some incomes of GBP 10000 are increased by GBP 110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on the top 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increase and spending cuts were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely fundamental requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was convinced the economy would grow by the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise previous amounts.
In his opinion, the economic downturn this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity’
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" by Labour, have called the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds over the next six years intolerable.
The ministers failed to come up with a credible plan for how this could be paid for, they added, "cynically" postponing this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be doable," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to proposals by the Tories, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the announcement - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - that it could lead to accusations of the chancellor in the election campaign if the money is difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people are in dire need of it and the situation will be reviewed on September 2010.
"Suspicious Budget"
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restraints.
The respected Institute of Budget Studies said the chancellor’s figures indicated substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, and defense.
"It's really painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to the Deloitte account reviror, added.
"That was the report on the suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI investigates US prisons in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating five Americans suspected of links to extremists in a prison in Pakistan.
The men were jailed for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, according to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the men were the same men who were reported missing in the past month at their home in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information on the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrests and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It said the house had always been the focus of local police attention and that charges had not yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, but said the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families in late November.
Denial of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report details "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One man said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was at risk of being raped.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demolitions since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them have been jailed and prosecutors have sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared some forms of torture unjustified and banned them from being carried out at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent put it.
"False Confessions"
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"They often beat me in the face," he said in a statement.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests after the election and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran's senior government officials have denied allegations of rape, but have admitted that torture has occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that Iran’s parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the authorities’ mandate and powers were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were poorly published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a downhill run for the race.
The downhill run for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park ski run was a short ski jump in front of the 100 m long ski run.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill run, but that it was truly daunting.
It was a wonderful sight to see the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talent."
The prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading alarms about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed, pondering whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they would integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Scarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study of the contentious issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at its core.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now care for 5 to 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular contentious issues that are being discussed and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media employs.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers, and intellectuals, among other well-known figures, including Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how one can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi's -- Sunni Islam purists associated in Saudi Arabia -- group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so obstinately defend the lay public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening the bolts of value".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The most bleak prospect in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
Bordering ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
Interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers upon their awakening.
In "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers attempting to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a daring 14-year-old lifeguard who only fought with a musket flask is truly a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears were performing in one circus tent at a time.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted by helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with powerful offensive tackles to blast off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, “On Ice,” Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and dismal responsibility of science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time indicated how the movement of floating ice occurs.
Submarines during the Cold War then charted the shifting dividers as they sailed under them.
Satellite exploration and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the catchment system 'inside the Arctic ice, created by the runoff of salt water, which shrinks as it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic miracles inside, all this is doomed as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, that was the day he paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me respect, just as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several wards during a memorial act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Home in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a memorial service in Arlington.
Now, it is an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit in this, they are looking for wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, on Pentagon territory, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at the landmark site of Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that this was her way of returning what was being done to the victim.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm cloth mantles, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the greystones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arch over the top.
Close by, in Ward 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there has been a real silence.
The associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the ward, but the bleak mood of the wars just taking place filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bowed to see the small black and white name tags, pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her son’s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the final resting place of Marine Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free . . . my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who imported cell phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, worked for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with an American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was jailed on December 5.
Some of the allegations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be jailed for almost anything labeled "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical statements, create a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prizes, but the permission was denied.
The detention of the U.S. contractor may be a result of growing tensions between Castro's Communist brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "retaining tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the New York Times' incarceration on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for text messaging because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's pay.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors, and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to apply, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba are behind bars for criminal acts such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, a press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said in a statement.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group's program, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as an allusion to installing Raul Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for an ailing older brother.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged leader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hope the case could help unearth a vast network of terrorist recruiters who are snooping around the Internet searching for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a grey rebel figure, known as Saifulah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment approving of the terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said Saturday that Saifulah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern quarter of Sarghod, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
Why they were dropped off, said the official, who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has placed the highest priority on attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, knocking out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about allowing the kohu to accede to them, as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to break into these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been so closely monitored?
This model is one that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched the streets this Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella city convention center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands attending the event, but police hope the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists were walking through the city carrying banners reading "This is not planet B" and one in Spanish saying "The country says 'enough'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the country's bleak state, which is being affected by the climate change that is still taking place.
This is part of the reason we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it can not be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching downtown Bello, saying they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating near buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then "several large explosions followed."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
He then continued in Chinese, saying "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He observed whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
We can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of the good news regarding the public education of the District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed greater progress among fourth- and eighth-grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Attestation Center for Advancement in Teaching are the persistent differences in knowledge attainment between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in Columbia County over the past two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers grew by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains broadly balanced, with a shift by a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP in the precinct was performed was 60 on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result in the children from the oboiu groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some district education advocates have commented in the past week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a not-for-profit group that advocates for equal education in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of the scattering of two or three points, said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing Ms. Rhee's administration style, Mrs. Brown stated that reporting the test results means the city's secondary education is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is appalling is that we have devoted almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the district's effort is to continue to seek better ways, focused on the needs of students with low scores.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum read, Wilson's reading system, aimed at upper-class elementary school students and high-school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their college careers and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily math and math curriculum for the sixth grade, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former headmaster Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and make the best interventions possible for those students who remain below class level, Mrs Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to narrow the gap.
It's a definite dilemma for Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political reverberations that go against an important agenda.
But the blame goes to other city managers who are trying to keep the middle ground between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to receive excellent public instruction.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to reducing the gap between the results achieved is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct, to make schools eligible.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who contracted with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he sees as a "symptom" for seeking a larger increase next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg dormitory with a loud respite.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracie's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the attic of the dormitory.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 per year, their standing was rather than fearful visitors excited potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania college was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely preoccupied with the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where from.
However, this is a major problem concerning the high number of US-born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish college students -- remarkable achievements -- report that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have attained higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and an innate drive and drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Taking into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school net in every way to get through college.
The federal program that financed Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparatory programs that start for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until those students graduate.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered college, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry reaches deal with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their infirm infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The ten agreements concluded by Iraq's Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies indicate that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned off in June.
The comparative participation of US oil giants in Iraq’s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by the massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as U.S. military withdrawals, are likely to deter U.S. companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven to have the third-largest reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
U.S. firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with Iraq's oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and has left with large stakes in contracts for two major fields.
“We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power,” oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
The companies that were pre-selected for submission of bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaida operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car near the city of Miran Shah in the province of Severn Vaziristan on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in the band of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, which was calling from the Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism department officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somali was poi of death.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaeda's military operations, directing the operations of terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He has been involved in plotting around the world, said a senior official who does not wish to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaida’s top leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia was quickly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well-connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a well-known person to some Americans, but that he didn’t demean himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when Najmudin Yalolov, a militant faction leader in the tribal belt, and three other top populist leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has decreased from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the Long War newspaper, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected were informants, the site said.
The top United Nations delegate in Kabul resigned.
The United Nations’ top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a UN-backed president in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the state, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge to the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has launched a search for a replacement.
Officials said they were deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but stated that Galgraith's charges -- who was released -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with respect to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the nation's top representative to coordinate the easing of efforts in the leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, saying he would strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of his efforts in Afghanistan, stating that the UN's cumbersome hiring regulations undermine its ability to harness capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran over a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is inherent unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and restraints" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" from sanctions.
According to White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the United Nations Committee on Nuclear Safety and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
Speaking in Geneva on October 1, he hinted that he wanted to return to talks about curtailing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserves in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - in part because, says the expert, the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
“Frankly, regarding Iran’s obstinacy towards the international community on some of the proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think it has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians,” Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seek other elections, including surveillance, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" in front of some members of the Security Committee about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Erbil.
High tensions persist between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to quell Kurdish concern about the ongoing depression. The US official posts quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn’t keep anything for the other, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old one-child policy has been implemented, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and pampered children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN figures.
Population distribution, where the population aged 60 and over is predicted to skyrocket from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with populations with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual calming
As it was inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate ever put in place under the rule of the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites promoted a policy that helped the country avoid critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in pursuing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively milder in their stance on the one-child policy.
As a rule, they allowed exceptions to be raised in 2004 - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children - and in 2007 they relaxed the diction of their slogans, advocating a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Population Research Institute of Beijing University, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
A grieving response
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai saw an increase in interest in couples wanting to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city's districts did not report changes.
Huinan Municipal District with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without an actual intercept network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view the one-child policy poorly as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a seven-month gestational relationship with her first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families' attention and everyone was taking care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care, and we didn’t really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, has expressed this much more clearly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced the birth rate, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds see their parents as struggling through the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want this way of feeding themselves, he says.
One child makes enormous demands on their parents’ time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time your child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-fetched attitudes and mutual defamation -- refocused on Friday on releasing a paper proposing ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But important progress has been seen in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN working group, this text unobtrusively outlines how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so they can reduce their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate should be.
This will give the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page paper, shorted the 180-page text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union swiftly discussed a pledge on Friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries embrace adaptation to climate change -- from coping with floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday listed the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Action Todd Stern rejected a speech demanding binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line towards China running officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of “common sense” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” led to a statement earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world’s major economic powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly for the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States to meet their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large emitters from being held accountable in their actions.
It’s clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change indicated that they would like to continue pursuing a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that enforcement by small island nations has "triggered a political chokehold on the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations raised a new urgency once delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government could come to an agreement.
Senior officials such as India’s environment minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister stepped out of the planes and ran through the halls of the Bella center to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering - with 13,000 people moving from and to the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staging at night ironic spectacles about the countries they thought had sent them, and hand-to-hand transmissions on paper rather than by e-mail - dominated by a challenge.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier in the middle 60 heads of state.
We have come into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the deputy minister for global policy on international nature conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first 140-mile-per-hour train redefined feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to signal the departure of a train that marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train set outside lLndyn.
It hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Neglected standing water should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on commercial roads, and switching from planes and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties were won over for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects, and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the building of Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the government with a viable study, passed its report on to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to West Midland has been proposed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape, a 25 m final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages to designate three choices for a large high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is Y-shaped confiscation, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The line should split near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
There should be a route to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," he said and a railway expert.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to run at 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK’s network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400 m long trains that would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to accommodate a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the net should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on existing lines north of Birmingham, and maintain travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be the decisive point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, an orientation point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a Tory front-seat bench holder in the House of Commons, was paid by taxpayers for thousands of pounds of costs last year for an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party's spokesman for the prison, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations", raised his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build an oak-clad extension at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to the taxpayers.
Municipal authorities approved the claims in time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the inspection of the member outlets. Last night Mr. Duncan voiced his demands "to make it cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-story houses in the village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is labeled "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupil's security to a mortgage of GBP 271406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan had been claiming approximately 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest in Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to fund a loan of  GBP 75,000.
The standard RBS mortgage payment variable fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, while it remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim ?1,250 for the month of May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the House shadow chief in September after a secret reporter filmed him saying MPs must survive "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on rations, and you're treated like shit."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May, when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax office approved that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently Legge."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and wringing or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
It wouldn’t work in many other ways to be cleaner or simpler.”
Come and take a closer look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Brighton’s coastal cottages have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the Ducal use of creativity, called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use Christmas carols as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to view the last hut from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and The First No'l, where the hut featured the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a non-scholarly priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottages arose just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, both worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a deal by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current demonstrations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing windows with cobblestones and hammers.
The police force intervened immediately.
Police said between 600 and 700 people had been arrested and that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", an ultra-radical separate group that had already manifested itself in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it’s time for that, says singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bove, one of the characters of the fight for the other world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for the other world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and headscarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta and Canada, hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets demanding tough action on climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares the move a “facade.”
About 13,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, turnout was 58% a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsha, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said Kvarciya Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapsha.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling station at the school in the capital, Sukhumi, into a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who came to oversee the successful elections, received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Arsba.
"We, the Abkhazians, are grateful," he said in a small ceremony, bearing in mind Moscow's support and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and toasted to it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
An absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive duel must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, a demonstration around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
Police said between 600 and 700 people had been arrested and that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", an ultra-radical separate group that had already manifested itself in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured by a cobblestone on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat located near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters once again blew up.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen on the call of the group Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated outside the city hall of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also met to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

Geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that history and geography subjects will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the final year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now, all second-year students will have four hours a week and there will be the same general culture program for everyone, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because according to him, the specialization S is no longer aimed at exact sciences" but "essentially the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations cannot be for With some sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complain that they do not teach geography and history in the last year of vocational grammar schools".
A Ifop poll published on Saturday by the daily Humanité showed that seven out of ten French people (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in a senior year with an S specialisation, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the abolition, both left-wing and some right-wing MPs.
On the other hand, the minister added that it is "not an option" to cancel the philosophy in the specialization program with the graduation year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they say will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of the Master’s study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field and at the end of the year, another examination verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of Master’s studies and will perform as a professor-intern in front of students for the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will get more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, he continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reconfirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university, the Ecole Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC), at the instigation of the Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after the fish from the local pond that the students named this way.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected, specifying that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours about climate change, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos filmed at these lectures will be posted on the school's website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is planned for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Unions of prison guards announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding that they be paid bonuses and overtime until Christmas, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd Guards Union) asked employees who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration held in front of prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them, thus alerting them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison guards (3rd trade unions of this sector) called on them to "convoke rallies in individual prisons and launch a major mobilization" with the view that it was "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and allowances for night work, Sundays and holidays" worked in October, were not paid in December.
The first union of prison guards, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation".
The Directorates of Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime overtime has increased a lot in 2009 and they have not all been included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellorship said at the end of the day that Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison wardens' union assuring them that payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system.
I have ordered the administration of prisons to take immediate action to ensure that the situation that arose from the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous bonuses for performing the function and fulfilling the objectives, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, angered by the interregional FO union in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and subpoenas" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays if they are not paid for these days in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more work and more tasks without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to let the lowest-ranking employees pay for it, reports CGT-Prison Guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, funds are scarce, said Ufap's secretary general, Jean-Francois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives 'Better Gifts' Than He Receives at Christmas
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of the screen Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive".
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special issue of the show, which will air on ABC on Sunday night about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his treat.
Boa is also fond of the baby, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also "obviously" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show's pre-broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “No, I gave you great gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Well, that's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?".
On this one-hour, very relaxed show, with the famous host who has been hard at work supporting Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their most popular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father gave him at Christmas, whom he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and giving me the basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until a long time later that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday in surgery again, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injury" resulting from a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest relatives, while RTL reported that the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-surgeged Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted "injuries resulting from the operation" of a herniated disc he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, saying these lesions required "repair surgery".
However, the singer's press department sought to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" while announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the lead partner of the singer's final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put to artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, RTL adds.
At the request of AFP, the press department did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau international clinic due to a herniated disc.
The surgery, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
Following the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he is a great "fighter".
He called me just before he flew to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a stupid thing, because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, stating that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small small bowel tumor" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long "Tower 66" tour, which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, his every health issue has been very much watched and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to once again deny the news of the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Indoor Swimming Championships, won the title at the 2009 European Indoor Swimming Championships in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the championship, on which overalls are last allowed, only three world records were broken, although many more were expected.
One of them surpassed the Hungarian Evelyn Verrasztova for the 200 m position race and two of the remaining men's relay Russia for the 4x50 m position race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who was taking a liking to the world record at 50 m in a free manner, which he already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which ten swimmers took off instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The suits have achieved 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of a jumpsuit this time did not help even the German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400-meter freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into the race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zolo’s Romanesque sarcophagus sold for $1.5 million
A slab of Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than French writer Emil Zola was auctioned off for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than estimated, said art dealer Sotheby's.
The cost of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchantas is a rare work, similar pieces are very few in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heinz, vice president of auctions of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it’s the subject most likely to be bid on, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola bought this marble a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who adorned a bath with it in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the coming to power of Marshal Petain.
It remained there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search of the museum's database at the Louvre that this plaque was part of "the remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
President Zelaya's aborted attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything indicates for the time being that there is no way to carry out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
A Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back again, a source at the General Directorate for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the chance to leave safely.
But the deposed president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The coup d'état government "experienced another setback when they wanted me to resign ... they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often comments on the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
Mexico’s embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who had come to rally around the embassy of Brazil, where the military had stepped up protection.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government's position.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had aligned himself with socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military, and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he walks out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "treason" on which he is accused, the putsch government says.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Pushes for Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance indicate an increase both in the United States and in its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on a “half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on U.S. trade balance figures "that show activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, were expecting an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has dropped "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also fallen.
The yield of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 years rose to 4.492% versus 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of pro-regime protesters shout "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on Thursday and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "lady in white" wives or close political prisoners were booed directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with a raised fist the supporters of the regime to the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who arrived to "provide security".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against the "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten dissidents were detained by police, who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, a journalist told AFP.
According to this journalist, the police loaded dissidents who had been bullied by government supporters into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours as a rule.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winner, "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of supporters of the government regime against "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party at its head and a one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A knife-wielding madman killed an 80-year-old man and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an eighty-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man, born in 1929, died at the hospital, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of thirty, the husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of another injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," said a police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jauras.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crosswise behind his back, said on the spot the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm the madmen, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was rushed by a crowd, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man while being wounded with fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed a big wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, also had knife wounds.
The man, who did not have his identity documents, was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre handed the case over to the investigation department of the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of himself" as "all madmen of this type, whose power in action increases tenfold".
USA: Polanski's lawyer asks for an end to criminal prosecution
Polish-French director Roman Polanski’s lawyer once again asked Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop prosecuting his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal counsel for the director of The Pianist, criticized the serious mistakes made at the time of the 1977 trial in California's Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and at once, lawyer Hummel said, adding that the behavior of the judge who was adjudicating the case at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda, "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to deal with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually declared in late September that he had "lyed" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state hearing, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
The Los Angeles deputy prosecutor, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "demands a favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take the decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in asking for Roman Polanski's prosecution to be stopped.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also called again for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced, adding, "No one in this room can say the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski Arrested in Switzerland on September 26
After more than two months behind bars, he was released under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible deportation.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is torn between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance leaving 0.55 points and finishing at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that have "helped to improve market sentiment in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," summed up the analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the trust of American consumers also returned, rising strongly to 73.4 in December, up from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes were hampered by a new rise in the dollar’s price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, “pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology is losing ground.
The stock market has fallen.
The yield of state treasures with a view of 10 years increased to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a view of 30 years increased to 4.497% versus 4.492% the day before.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After traveling across South Africa for a month, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This big beauty celebration took place for the second year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, and so far five candidates have gained promotion to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar, and Yanbing Ma of Canada were voted Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a veritable whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things and I’ve had so many experiences!” she confided to Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I could not have imagined a more beautiful country in which I would put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its “breathtaking landscape”.
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the election with Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for the president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the drawing in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be returning to the 2010 World Cup, Alice Taticchi says enthusiastically.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
“It’s very strong and everything is going very well,” said David Hallyday, as he got off the plane from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21pm world time).
The singer's son, who was calm, said he would arrive "as soon as possible" at the Cedars-Sina Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-surgery infection following a prolapsed intervertebral disc operation he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer was in Los Angeles that night for the sake of convenience "put into an artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday, a doctor at Cedars-Sina Hospital in Los Angeles, has been put to artificial sleep due to an infection following an operation on a herniated intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at La Pitié-Salpotriere Hospital, said he was flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly blamed Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, M. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke with the doctor by phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I had already suffered from an intervertebral disc prolapse twice, he added.
Shortly before, he told RTL radio that the singer had apparently left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was active at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical negligence, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Chamber, called him a "scrupulous man" who is "regularly" summoned to the Medical Chamber, and who cannot be "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "absolutely good" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so the insertion of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising the tone and calling on the Nouveau Centre party to no longer use their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDemFrancoise Bayrou party, responded on Friday to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the abbreviation of the former Giscard party, saying that the abbreviation must not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the abbreviation UDF, saying that Francois Bayrou does not deserve to carry her legacy after shaking hands with the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move gained support from MP Hervé de Charetta (former pro-UMP now for NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to have it registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF run by friends of Francois Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of its silence and made a formal request to both the minister and MPs to stop using the acronym and hand back ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised worrying statements about proposing to your political movement to "retake" the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, among them Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem party or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you thought it appropriate to include the name +Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF of today+, on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mention of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over trademark ownership to legitimate owners".
If you fail to do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau Centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie francaise).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to form a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used a non-existent registration acronym to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion is beginning to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically comment on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in both politics and everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for yourself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: Francois-Marie Banier will be tried for the abuse of a state of weakness.
On Friday, a court in Nanterre decided to try artist Francoise-Marie Banier and rule on whether he had used the weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which his daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames on him.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for the abuse of a state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum penalty of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in what can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010, at the same time giving a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think he's gonna do it.
"I will speak to her about it," said Georges Kiejman, Bettencourt's lawyer.
As for the lawyer for Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court’s decision.
This is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that this old lady, who needs protection, has been manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched a criminal case against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist she blames for exploiting her mother’s state of weakness for years to raise a billion euros in donations in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ Friday court speech sometimes turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she expressed her censure towards her husband Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, “Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Francoise."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office found again that the applicant’s conduct was not justified, all the more so as the guardianship judge rejected her application to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of attending court, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her,” said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court eventually ruled that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy would be upheld at the time the trial began.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: the idea is for co-workers to identify with the "values" determined from above, as was the case before, when it was necessary to impose products on the consumer that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has aligned the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, regularly come back!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, affecting mostly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires an active approach and the ability to anticipate" from all stakeholders and requires commitments from employees that are completely at odds with the revenue of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a managerial revolution that should aim to put employees at the center of the company’s interest as well as the client’s.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after various turns will return as a priority to what it has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduate students for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of convenience of thought, they adopt an old behavioral theory, now revived by "neurosciences" from the USA and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "leverages" (sic) of the involvement of managers, a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the site Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic insight into all management plans and practices: For employees, obligations to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is dealt with only by the Motivational Functional Analysis studies.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them, through the image that tells about the business, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate, and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management "on track."
This creates a fertile ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo, Obama earned praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, content with the fact that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner advocated the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who initially scoffed at Obama's award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had commented on the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs, which are now being published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would want to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I thought this speech was quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the Peace Prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a “world citizen” as he always did, but he “spoke like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they didn’t create themselves, and that they’re not doing too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
A few right-wing hawks include former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "uniform, pompous and uninspired", as stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-leftist press takes a laudable stance towards the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of the peace prize to Obama premature, it assessed his output as "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Obama “speaked the speech that was needed,” the New York Times said, calling the speech “simple and instructive.”
Road hauliers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the road hauliers' union and the TLF, the only employers' organization left until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
Dominique Bussereau, the secretary of state for transport, said Friday that he was “joyful” after several negotiations began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early on Friday with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six more hours for the meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the agreement to be signed at 6 p.m.
This conflict "would hurt businesses greatly" and "would be in danger of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text includes a wage increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest salary increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will give orders to our members not to have any blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, the president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high salaries due to the international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100-120 euros for the highest ones.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of play of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the 13th salary issue and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "100 million euro reduction in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 draft budget law, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consecutive" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in the case of expansion by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hindered by the opposition of employers' organizations.
The FNTR called the deal “bad” because “100 million euros has already been offered to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to take emergency action, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters during the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to “burie a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry” over the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: traffic interruptions on the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
Interruptions on the RER A commuter train line, France’s largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as Friday’s negotiations between the unions and RATP’s management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium request.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 am and 8 pm, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, except for this section only one train out of four.
The connection to the SNCF will be cut off at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to switch trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP sought to secure links with large department stores".
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation at rush hour, and virtually none of the trains were running at the off-peak time as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because there were no pupils or students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time".
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, the SNCF said, as a larger number of bailiffs and law enforcement officers were forecasted.
The RER A commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
Other general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with the management, which the unions rated as "weak", will be evaluated.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A commuter trains in all respects, working time adjustment, career progression, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Southern Unions).
RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which scandalized the CGT, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while for the travel carriers and SNCF it went".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be reviewed more closely", RATP specified.
Which is why trade unionists think the business is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which had so far rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to hold a meeting in the interest of "calming down".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents announce a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, including 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and are complaining about deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER commuter train drivers earn between 2,200 and 2,700 euros in gross wages and between 600 and 650 euros in bonuses for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey’s Constitutional Court ruled on Friday that the main pro-Kurdish party in the country should be abolished, prompting protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges when a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kili said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Turk and MP Aysely Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats (out of 500) in Parliament.
The party's leadership warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than serve as non-political MPs.
The ruling is a continuation of a trial launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the rebels of the PKK.
The party assures that it has no "fundamental connection" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government hands the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights, attempting to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is being held in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is populated mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired rocks from slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Mr. Turk stated that the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve the issue by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, formed by the party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're against party interference on principle.
It doesn’t matter, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, political scientist Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow can come
A nice crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes for.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services FES.
But so that its employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first time this has happened, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they will run on 20 so-called A-slots, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and passageways such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents like Atzelbergstrasse.
FES service starts at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to keep the roads clear when traffic to work begins".
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the dumpsters".
Only when it doesn’t snow that much are the access and connection roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot soldiers set out on the road, preferring to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that tracks mainly bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Because they form a fast iceberg, the sprinklers go out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: An animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's issue of the journal Science write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Tawa opens a new window on the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship, distribution, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for Triassic deposits, says team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains were collected from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of the Triassic dinosaurs are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm unreservedly.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards divided into three most important developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (bird-birds), to which the species belonged for example.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after an analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air sacs, which even the descendants of theropod birds have.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, even the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of the giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by a common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs to date lived in South America, scientists have deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three evolutionary lines split early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time as the supercontinent Pangaea formed a unified Earth mass.
The team, along with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from the same common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonno paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted picture, as very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, while they are rarely found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare by-line of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the time of the Earth's Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while relatives became extinct and the interface of the Triassic and Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could squeeze out the competition.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the Triassic and have lived in the shade ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police eviction of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt has caused a worldwide stir.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the Presidium's incited police intervention.
Because the walls were scribbled and the artworks were done, university president Werner M?ller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the cause, the signers judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police commando".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unauthorize and criminalize protest" and divert attention away from content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for an end to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that the majority of strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the enigmatic Land Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, Hessen Science Minister Eva Kuehne-Hurmann (CDU) is defending the university president and the police.
I am grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have sympathy for the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a eviction.
Linke filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon - Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt-based Riedberg Science Centre - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits took place and on Wednesday, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a "Protocol on Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s vice-mayor Yuri Rosljak and Zelenograd prefect Anatoly Smirnov, while Frankfurt was signed by senior planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, large concerns Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was established in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape into which the research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is quite simply the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of a railway station, more than a monstrous building that plunges the capital of Baden-Wuerttemberg into a decade of desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the city centre were then considered 19th century transport and technical fossils that act as brakes on modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to rear-end the locomotives.
Drive, stop for a while, go on - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway along the trans-European railway route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although visions from the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities, the start of construction is almost unfinanceable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have problems with detours and exits.
Still: Stuttgart 21 starts, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be justified.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the railway transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight cars.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider the real 10 to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, it has been built at a slow pace on this route.
You need to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The line through the Rhine Valley will become a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden State Assembly whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has mandated experts to legally assess the more than 400-page verdict of the VGH, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel explained in writing that the state would have to adjust the night flight ban in case of construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt airport.
Permitting 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the provincial government, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population from night-time aviation noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th whether to seek a review of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and slammed the government's representatives for abandoning the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Goembel, has called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights before the election. Otherwise, it can be considered a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch has rejected Schäfer-Goembel's rebuke, the country's government trying to get to its night flights through "twisting the law and tricks".
Accurate legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Muller (FDP).
His faction’s claims to ban night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. Banks Repay Aid
American, crisis-shaken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
On Wednesday, Bank of America repaid a total of $45 billion in aid from the bank’s rescue fund, Tarp.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
Thus, the constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has raised $19 billion in net money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her treasury, which was filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night explicitly thanked the U.S. taxpayer: The cash injection has helped us through a difficult time.
The financial institution suffered damage at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, said the bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the aid.
Quick Choice
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after the ZDF's board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the Bureau wanted to make a deal with that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to pre-empt the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Bureau.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter's board of directors failed with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
An EU majority on the board had already signalled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by arguing that the ZDF's monitoring quotas had fallen under Brender.
Thus, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time 35 state-law lawyers intervened in the debate, they considered Koch’s procedure unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for S?dwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey switched to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Media Magazine's Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board, the Rhine-Falk prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Länder should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a shrewd chess move, strongly criticizing the board immediately after Brender was deposed.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter could have nominated him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, and he could have been elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party had been forced into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is categorized as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Part success for students: After a year of strikes, the Ministers of Culture finally visited the Länder on Thursday: At a conference of Ministers of Culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for Bachelors and Masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the exam load: In principle, each study module should end with one single exam.
In addition, the workload of learners should be reviewed, and a "real and defensible rate" guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create more flexible joint structural assignments for Bachelor and Master courses.
Earth's variances should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university rectors had winged words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided that the number of exams will be reduced in part drastically: "Each module will usually be terminated with only one exam", says the 30-page report, which is to partially re-regulate the approval of study fields.
Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, said: “The flawed development that has significantly reduced the difficulty of the study should be stopped.”
To do this, the "difficulty of study" in the future is to be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content must be “hardly checked” so that they “do not unnecessarily restrict the student’s choice.”
and Seminary.”
Students should "entitle a space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but also after review for existing fields of study.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 before all fields of study are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany and are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the culture ministers called on the federal states to act so that the curriculum was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In the individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on appropriate measures with the regional ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign offices.
For this, countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required for the completion of the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution has also fallen.
The Federal Board of Higher Education groups called for education policy-making not to take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be said" also by the students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students", she said at a meeting with ministers of culture, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions have not gone far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree access to an extension master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that there are enough Master’s degree positions available tomorrow for today’s generation of undergraduate students, with the best possible study conditions, said Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Board of Directors.
The federal states must employ far more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Muller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one of the poems by the poet Werner Soellner, who in this torn-out language piece thematizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publisher, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
He has been awarded various literary prizes, having lectured at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1993, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he hosted a seminar in Munich about “German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts.”
Obviously insecure and stunned, Soellner left a statement admitting his cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the people present, he was awarded the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts at recruiting reportedly began inconspicuously, at first in 1971.
I am, continued Sullner, "that is, someone who has not resisted sufficiently the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Soellner is an undercover agent of Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Herta Muller and her unprecedented literary dealings with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and the ignominy of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Soellner is not only the perpetrator, if you can say so according to the current state of knowledge, but he is also the victim.
In the Securitate acts, undercover agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after S?llner's confession and referred to the positive influence of undercover agent Walter on himself.
"He was cutting me off at all the important points for him," Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Sollner’s statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that the former dissident confessed and cooperated with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Muller wrote as early as July, when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reserve for the Secure spies.
Concerns, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the Czech Republic, in the meantime a very reliable inspection of the Stazi files, the handling of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issuance of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the management of the components.
The fact that former Securitate members still have a lot of influence in Romania has been proven by an interview in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Timisoara rejected the award.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The denigration of power has been expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the context of a concealed offence, there are unavoidable questions about the S?llner case.
Why now? Who has been hurt? The peculiar reaction of the listeners to Sollner’s confession makes it expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the acknowledgment of guilt and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Muller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It looked as if a clean-dressed sales representative had arrived from a cute Christmas party at which a manufacturer of sports goods was handing out sweets when a new coach, VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored bag of a sponsor, boarded the recalled C-Class Mercedes a quarter after midnight.
A man with a distinctive baldness let himself be driven around a foreign city for him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and a 55-year-old man was also not drunk with happiness.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it's just getting started.
In the words of only three days of an engaged Swiss: "Although we reached the eight-finals", that is, in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "we must not let ourselves be dazzled by success: it will be a brutal hard fight against relegation."
The "more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid repeated obvious weaknesses after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11th).
Drawings
The Champions League eight-finals (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/ rematch 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor will be preserved.
Not only with the alleged healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to commit and joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be more courageous, explained soul healer Gross so simply sounding successful recipe, which but under the influence of the therapist Babbel showed no effectiveness.
He fanned a certain magic, admitted Babbel's follower Jens Lehmann, "when there is a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics after many weeks of injury, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet rescued, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after a 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sporting chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate even after his first home win in three months on his 40th birthday was due to weekend events that came to life fresh in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match started.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He threw a weak lead to the board and decided to change the coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also called the cancellation of his free day after the matches a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism", Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
Both 40-year-olds will no longer enjoy life.
In any case, they are one with the others, that without the work of a deposed coach team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
World Heavyweight Championship
Passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The judges’ statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on points on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is Kličko's third successful title defense after his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the World Champion by WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out to be what everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he was defeated twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, Klitschko drove a 2.02 meter tall duel mainly with his left hand.
Johnson, who had announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, withdrew from the world champion's strokes, so Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
All in all, passive Johnson did little on the challenger and just tried to get into the next rounds.
Although Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, his strokes rarely hit the world champion.
Still, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko for twelve laps.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "disgusting zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion allowed himself to be provoked, removing his sunglasses from Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his "WBC" belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defense of the title, and Chris Arreol of the USA in September.
I only got one shot in this fight and I’m physically in good shape, Klitschko explained.
His dream, however, remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the World Champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by David Haye after he dethroned Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye cancelled a duel against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz Case
Opposition frontal assault: Green Party leader Jurgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz air strike, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a deliberate deception.
The minister on the deadly bombing of two tankers in September said "consciously untrue", said the head of the Green faction, Jurgen Trittin, in Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just about the destruction of hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, demanded by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan Bundestag's policy - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, J -rgen Trittin and fellow Greens member Renate K -nast have called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the ministry's handling of the background to the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both of them informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
Officials said they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was reported from the vicinity of the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, among them a two-page document of the commanding colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the meantime in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the criticism on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the Bundestag's inquiry committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or in drug intoxication that draw the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with wildest fantasies and fanciful mirages.
However, those who experience dream states in their waking life, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo in today’s Western world.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will now and then ensure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality merge.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and the effect may vary, however, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis, and hallucinations can be inferred from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal transmitters - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's fall 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and vividly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him are winged devilish figures with bloody red grimaces, valuing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, knotting them into a loop and fixing it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He jumps.
Looping's on.
Learn, chorusing voices tearing his drum, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today Henningu T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was triggered.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides, he is manic-depressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About 1% of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most sufferers can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain can not filter out the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which one perceives in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
Misguided thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains do such things.
Exceptional states can lead anyone to lose touch with reality in the short term, Fuchs says.
But not everyone develops into a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early-stage neuronal brain maturation, such as maternal viral disease, will be damaged during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a riddle how the neuronal system malfunctions, which did not manifest itself in any way for many years.
Influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain gets wet
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and in order to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lubeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The unreal world in our head).
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too little suppressed; when our brain boils, or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other states of emergency.
In more recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the local grammar school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the shapes and voices.
During breaks, she may be approached by a collapsible woman with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl considers herself an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows that.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the signs are rather discouraging.
Often, delusions are a burden.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audible and visible on the board of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are rather discouraging.
When she is waiting in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she cannot often tell whether she is awake or already asleep, whether the images she sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she has not gone crazy.
Delusions are also an art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or deprived of stimuli, they are likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
My guess is that the brain doesn’t have enough work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she calls dad since she thinks he is not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain lets form, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also interprets night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to rate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Borderline between Dream and Hallucination
Unfortunately, in our over-concentrated world, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Dusseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agonizing disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the subject considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them retroactively from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full-consciousness motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and of himself, even if he is completely unable to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A type of borderline between a dream and a hallucination.
Since it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, the worlds will change, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in an intolerable situation that allows us humans to form our own ability to pass into a loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a soul rescue action.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness set out on a multi-day journey, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created, visiting strange times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek man on a motorcycle, surfs the firn in the Alps on a hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
Immerse yourself completely in the imaginary, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
Contrary to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear years later and in unimportant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in state of consciousness, Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
At 27, the children's publishing house will take over.
The new head of Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to both of his children, SPIEGELU said.
In the future, the holding will belong 100% to the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says 69-year-old man SPIEGELU.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only after.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put your children at the head of 7,500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the board of directors since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Cashier section added responsibility for the company's assets, and after the resignation of J?rgen Todenh?fer also Direct Marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", Burda said.
The holding should still belong 100 percent to the family in the future, Burda says.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even family businesses are unsure of the demise: "It has always affected companies that have let themselves be infected by the desire for capital, that have speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play the World League with "Time", these deals are too big.
Complex beauty care
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being, you have at your fingertips.
El Corte Inglés has just launched the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre of more than 1000 m2, which provides a variety of services in the field of body care.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, which houses such prestigious companies as Hedonai dealing with laser hair removal; Spaxion, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a nutrition department and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different types of tea.

Escotes Variados
Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is convenient to find out what celebrities are wearing, and adapt your festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be noted.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. Not recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE' office will establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will secure mobility agreements, deal with, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the roll-out of electric vehicles.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the autonomous region of Catalonia.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa when it comes to the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'quiet period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that Spain's automotive industry, the country's main export sector, will face a "peaceful period".
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarized the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," the prime minister said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected for this industry in the future, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the Automotive Industry (PIA), has earmarked 800 million for the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which have mobilised an investment in excess of EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government's measures to support the requirement, mentioning the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed to reduce the average level of emissions for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Car Salon will be opened in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on February 5-7, 2010 in the Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, a Mercedes Benz specialist company.
Tests of fitness in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the holding of concentration, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and auditions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on the sporty style.
That’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - also christened jaki-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a gasoline engine of 2.0 150 hp.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these are excellent features of the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using a set of tools and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style presented by the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced fuel consumption.
As for the equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of standard equipment, it is necessary to mention the Lane Keeping System (RVM), which prevents blind spot, traction and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1.500 euros: adaptive dual-xenon lights and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized mainly by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0 and 150 hp gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for the Luxury version and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. has a red carpet, as gentle as Penelope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, used only to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine honored him as one of the products of the year.
It’s hard to see outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for an iPhone data plan.
Following its success, the company began offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, but for which Peek has to pay six times the amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited, just like its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently look for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon, when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators begin to think differently and consider various offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for when purchased, not after months.
And this is exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case ofFonPeek, it is a possibility to purchase with permanent access as Peek has already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to take office, she chose the dress and coat in this color, the same color she chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the USA decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models quite different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium high heel, now a similar model, but in golden color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this timea taunt, previously melted hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems.
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study 'The Fertility and Career of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of motherhood.
The study highlights that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences in opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, begin to live with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child for an average of 3.7 years from the start of cohabitation. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving stable employment and therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although it has less influence on the time of commencing cohabitation with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage andbirth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 to 49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to get a stable job before marriage and the birth of their first child,” says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of female representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
One of the most elegant actresses of the international level, Joyeux Noel joins other famous L’Oréal Paris personalities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the Shack') joined this select club.
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by notable personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'The Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - met at the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicento 's
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-ray images of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life) in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares neither timidity nor inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
Of Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of a counter-destiny, a morality without guilt, and an innocence without any god."
Of Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote according to his own nature and not the intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been ensnared with passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by way of perdition."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said he was the heir of a landowner in the county, and at other times he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, they were big dreams.”
Of Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge this man's deranged cry from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, running away from himself and crying out to the future and speaking fiercely to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt down and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'"
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After the effort comes the dream,/ after the storm a quiet harbor,/ after the war rest,/ after a full life death."
Of Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his bags.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly.
About Pío Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos up to but to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else was Benet up to but to have Baroja executed with Faulkner's gun?
What else was the object of Cela but to make himself famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by, and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter weighing a maximum of six kilograms, was kicked twice and badly injured without a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we do not see anything amusing in such an aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed man, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was any good, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The outrage has led us to report this fact.
We do not understand what happens to today’s youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not understand where the right manner has gone, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Traffic Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, both of whom have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries or fatalities can be avoided in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin said the campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products", and confirmed that it is working to achieve this goal in other ways, such as through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 motorcycle repairs will be made to make it known to the general public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety "is a constant problem" for this company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented a 12.6% increase compared to 2008, and what’s more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the umbrella organisation of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam dealers.
However, a favorable figure is better to put into quarantine, since November 2008 is a significantly bad period for comparison and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, even if they were bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases they are financing through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation, should be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is also necessary to mentionpersons doing business on the trade license of small and medium-sized companies who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Dealers expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system, it will also be with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others a deadline is set for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure put in place in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, while working to help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver presses.
However, it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided annually.
Reducing this number will be even more striking - according to calculations, one in four accidents would be avoided with an impact on people - after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as much as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - likely April 8 - as Javier Ortega reported, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is working to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party it concerns.
As a result, the final document, which will first be presented to the employees and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, might be one of them, but he is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still in force if it is not sold.
Driving a Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only1.275 kg.
The basis was, in the first place, the automatic draw roof is in a canvas version with manual control, thereby reducing the weight by 21 kg; in addition, aluminum doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to a weight reduction of an additional 7 kg; after mounting the sport seats an additional 19 kg from the wheels.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a hand-shifted six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many convoluted turns.
His conduct can only be qualified as inviolable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press against the asphalt.
On the contrary, we haven’t tested a model as small and lightweight as this in the long run, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete able to warm up his muscles in a short drive for the time it takes until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume engine use...
Anything we want, with a steering that's as communicative as it is precise, anything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S), is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used at the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
Curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we pass with Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car coped well with the potholes.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet in some corners we came across frost and gravel even in the advanced morning.
This ultralight is definitely one of the funniest cars on the market, as it’s more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, the iconic Coco Cocoon and the occasional 'starlette' at the 'company' shows, the singer shows off her evil girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
She won a brilliant 82-91 victory at the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences from the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus became the leader of her group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team managed to replace the significant absence ofHerrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to gain victory.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started head-on for the blues, who stood on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad opted for the internal game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, who was received by whistles and applause on returning to his original post to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to prove to be the best in his squad with 13 points, although 'without six' in the Splitter rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elías' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the return of the 'yellows' to the limelight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed several precision games to take their breath away, and then a Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which by three triples almost in succession and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alawites rubbed their skins in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the squad alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter eliminated for foul seIvanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner andTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly to Olympiacos in Greece, leaving him to lead Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor of the rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with12-18, a minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, a minute 13, which was the point where the battle between the USABeverley and Williams supports meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja squad
Between internal players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, a minute 19.
Impossible retribution
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to make up the difference from the match in Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages, Unicaja, thanks to the lead and triple points Cook and Lewis' contribution, left some hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the strengthening and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to levelbasket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.

Within a week of the app working, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally “feels poorly rewarded,” explained Albert Rivera in his report responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros of gross per year and the French 31.059, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs in the last three months are the driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, a chargé d'affaires Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27 after the end of his mandate he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy ahead of schedule: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, was trying to impose on him.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has re-emerged in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where negotiators are making decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly releasing liquidity at near-zero rates so that financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
Central banks have already confirmed that outright asset purchases have practically ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into gear, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore doubting the world economy’s ability to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in a return to reduced risk returns.
Stock market volatility and company bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Quality is once again under pressure, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the refuge of choice for investors, widening the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at the time Standard & Poor's came in and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's downsizing.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless in silencing the advocates of moral risk, who have again sought to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy by preventing the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections, and a new government are coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Dur?o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to default on its commitments.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to shared responsibility while taking extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe’s differences are reduced and ours widened, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upturn scenario, including OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy it does not bode well for living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "carefully, fellow driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is currently discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by Gas Natural-Fenos President Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided the press with a few remarks on the proposal he had put forward to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies".
Galan, who believes that the sustainable economy bill that the government has just passed fits the line the company demanded, did not want to let go like a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which is contrary to the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measure, as President Iberdrola called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now, because their maturation takes time and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins ‘handling’ of Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferential partner for Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which no economic deadlines have yet been reached, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which goes to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre’s tasks will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona aims for its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water utility.
The tunnel is estimated to be worth 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for the Acción to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway business.
The tunnel is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP in English) for further development of the project in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for construction and toll operation.
Bids are expected to be submitted in the month of May, with an expected investment of 1,700 million Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the final phase, three major European construction companies are competing.
Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
Northern Direct is against Acciona with the presence of Laing O’Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to pass through the network is called LBRJV, and it includes the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major civil construction company Razel.
Australia’s infrastructure market promises major construction and privatization, but carries a clear difficulty of entry other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
ACS acquired its market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Million Assets
Acciona focuses on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
An underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to connect the Western Highway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of works for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of works is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
ACS will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable through its local branch in Leighton.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-storey King George tower project in Brisbane, Australia, and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC has allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, the FCC has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the highway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The company won the contract a few days after carrying out work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, the company operating the railway reported.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the audition announced by Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for hindering competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Telecom 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles in their competitors' way.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition watchdog considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Play in the Champions League has brought since the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barca
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed EUR 5,362.5 million among 105 teams (of which 12 were Spanish) that had participated in this event since the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the grand prize three times.
Catalonia's current champion and last winner of the defunct 1992 European Cup is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich’s Bayern, the two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the previous Champions League.
They both lost to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to win the most money through Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributions
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make $1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA is donating 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who reached the participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match in which they participated.
There is also a bonus per win (800,000 euros) and per draw (400,000 for each team). Eight finalists get three million each; eight quarter finalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion will earn 9 million, while the second finalist 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barca earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
The champion from last year will receive 40%of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumasa Group published details of its stock offer, with which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday, the Sos stock ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce further changes the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be scrapped
As for the Salazar credit, yesterday former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified in the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million, without knowing the place of their destination.
CNMV allows option to exclude Paternina, which participated in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved an exclusion, involving Inversora Mer, against Federico Paternin on October 9.
The Authority explained that it authorises the operation as it understands that its conditions are in line with the applicable standards and considers that the explanatory brochures submitted following the modifications introduced on 2 December are "sufficient".
The CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, which could not be transferred in any way until the offer, which she had specified, had been determined by Federico Paterna according to the provisions of the applicable standards, had been closed.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents earn not only car repair shops.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a garage, where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be long and complex work.
Calculate manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and insurance and maintenance forecasting solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American Solera Group is a leading company; 80% of the reviews are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain, and each provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies start to work.
This is a very feverish job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, each model is carried out "intelligent" graphic processing, where it is possible to "punch" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
In terms of the rolling park in circulation they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread over the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
Processing this vast stream of information allows businesses to use and provide a variety of products.
The most common uses are focused on repair and maintenance, but there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States they do.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, the standard insurance claims solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is applied according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line to be fully identified only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to decommission vehicles with a total insured event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendency, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsa certain brand has gone through service due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance claims over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells the Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs, as well as providing digital images, access to parts or prices, and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for damage assessment, accident or car maintenance.
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year for the last three years and in 2008 they charged 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is established in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoicing of Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was listed for $1,000 million and its shares are now estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet-based base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles following an insurance claim.
The operation assumed a subscription of 59.5 million euros out of 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, connoisseurs, rental companies, repair shops, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before the operations begin.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 connoisseurs.
It manages 3,000 daily adverts and about 100 new adverts are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been retired cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historic value may be allowed to operate, although they have been decommissioned, after preliminary proceedings.
Service budget in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for persuading older professionals who are more or less restrained in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired with the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass them on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to display the inside.
