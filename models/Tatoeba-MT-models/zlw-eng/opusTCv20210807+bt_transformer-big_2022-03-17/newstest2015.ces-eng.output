Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talks with Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech national team for a game rehearsal with the Americans and then for a sharp start to the qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
Thibaut Courtois takes over for Chelsea in the new Premier League season, and Czech has been substituted for the first time in ten years at the London club.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Čech.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atletico Madrid and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2-4 to San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He finished the French league season with two wins and two draws, shooting St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille amicably 1:1 over the weekend.
News broke on the English tabloid websites today that they might want Čech at Queens Park Rangers.
However, according to the bookmakers, Chek’s last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet set the course 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey for the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what an offer that can't be turned down actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea, whether the club would deal with the possible offer or not.
Is it technically possible to make such a transfer while you are in Prague?
Would it not be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere at the national events and certainly many transfers will be closed today.
So it would certainly be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
Are you not pushing to leave?
The situation when I did not catch the first three games of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
“I want to continue playing for Chelsea and it’s up to the coach who he chooses to make the decisions in the coming weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision?
I take into account all the factors.
Of course, the sports aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family belong, of course.
Do you think you could play for another club in England?
This is a question I thought would never concern me.
Anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe. On his first major visit since May's election victory, he is due to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third largest economy.
First of all, there are plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the correspondents, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Karrata police arrest 20-year-old man after motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it drove 125 km/h through the 70 km/h zone and drove into the bush to escape the police.
Traffic police tried to stop a blue motorbike on the road in Karrata this morning when they noticed that it was going 125 km/h when leaving the petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, so the police officers lost him out of sight.
The motorcycle and the person matching the driver's description were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgara.
Karrath police have charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to a halt and reckless driving.
He will appear in court in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges during a hearing at the Glasgow High Court.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the trial at the Edinburgh High Court on 17 November.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill to protect union organizing as a civil right.
“The way the unions work, the middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That’s why I’m so proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act alongside John Lewis’ occasional rights model.
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to resist discrimination in union organizing as with other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Modifying the Labor Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join unions, to sue in a civil court - and to sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents of the law are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the labor struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, extend, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country stood for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
Convinced that workers and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included language in them and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Realizing that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations which will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to damage it will be revoked. Measures to fulfill such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the drafters and Roosevelt's guarantee included in it that "everyone has the right to form and join unions in order to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and assert themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the trade unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is greatly delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have elevated America and made it a true promise of democracy.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Shut Down All Louisiana Abortion Clinics
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state, according to lawyers.
The bill, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion practitioners to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain this permission in the meantime.
“The proposing party will be able to legally carry out its activities and in the meantime obtain a permit,” federal judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution regarding the bill.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a sneaky law that would deprive them of their health and rights,” Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they also apply for this permission.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by provision.
Key parts of Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Women's rights activists, together with the American Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association and the American Medical Association, say the need for this license places medical demands on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion have argued that the measures are aimed at protecting women's health, and some have also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one doctor performing abortions is allowed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting to process a request for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
RELATED: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of the women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who had been diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"The disease is best treated by gynaeco-oncologists, who are usually based in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are healing away from their family and friends.
Dr Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the decrease in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to today’s young generation of consumers reaching “the main age group of gardeners,” garden centers losing up to ’10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, on average, people who rent their homes spend 55% of the amount they spend on their own gardens.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as a parking area, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In Greater London, where the proportion of homes owned has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, the spending on horticultural products in Britain is the lowest per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have stated that living in sublet or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor for RHS, said: “It’s very popular with tenants to grow plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which most reminds me of the Hitler Youth, rattled with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both intense nationalism and the fact that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time flows differently in the East than it does in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for domination over Europe was long gone, in the East it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the completely identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps Western politicians caused it themselves, maybe they patted Vladimir on the shoulders a little, maybe they did not invite him where he wanted and maybe they began to underestimate him and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He cleaned up at home, pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere, and sharpened knives at home.
Now he has decided to take back his lost position.
He starts slow, he has time.
He's probably a leader for life, so where would he rush to?
He trampled the Caucasians, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then it's the Baltic dwarves' turn.
You've been biting a Russian bear in your fur long enough.
This will surely be noticed by China, which is jumping too much and is definitely taking a liking to the Far East.
And the Germans are pissing off Vladimir, too, how well they are, and we gave them that on their ass at 45.
How about making a new Novorossia in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base and there are a lot of ours and as they are oppressing them and dacha already wanted to demolish some of them.
Our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, he can peel like onions and eat their whole EU.
That would be a way for them to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we'll use our compatriots who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and if they are said to be oppressed there, they are simply oppressed there, and we will not leave them that way, we will protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is he born?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which the proud Ivan can dance the Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey’s foreign minister has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British spy activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said Turkey was a priority target for U.S. and British intelligence agencies, according to documents provided by a former National Security Agency analyst.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones Reveals More 4th Season Tricks
Game of Thrones creators are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.

Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and city hall officials in the Calvia self-governing area to the Mallorcan state prosecutor's office on Friday.
The chief of police in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, was arrested after allegations were made by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after corruption charges were filed against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police and state officials of the town hall in the Calvia self-governing area to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Authority.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police on corruption charges and will be heard by a judge together with Navarro.
Spain's national newspaper ABC cited unhappy owners of night-time businesses as saying favoritism by public officials has had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island’s authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday party attendees in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours to bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the tour of the bars by Carnage, paid a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel swimming pool.
First Day of Spring Marked by Rain and Storms Impacting Adelaide Airport Flight
SPRING brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and gusty winds that severely hit Adelaide's airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is to fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain introduced itself along with a few short showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind that began before 8 p.m. and within about ten minutes produced nearly 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
Stormy weather is believed to have contributed to Virgin Airlines' delayed arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at that time reached speeds of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane must have dropped from its second landing and finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay subsequently caused delays to other flights, including Emirates' flight from Dubai and Qantas' flight from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from the fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks, but signs of struggle are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten hit by a rocket have removed debris from the wall and are slowly waiting for the return of the children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a Saad kibbutz resident and English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to go to school again.
“We had a hard time and didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
Kibbutz, located near the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border in which a shot from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said about 12 families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite peace on Tuesday.
The ceasefire has led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, but it has not resolved key issues such as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these numbers and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in hundreds of UN schools that have been turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
I swear to God, I’m standing here.
And Lafat is worried about the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Twenty-three members of the squad have problems with the Spartan striker David Lafata, who is suffering from temperature problems.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, they were more players and David probably still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or if he's fit tomorrow, we'll see based on his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he said.
The other players are okay.
“Of course, someone has some pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or take part in a game on Wednesday against the USA,” he said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called up Lukáš Vácha as the last player of the Spartan midfielder.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided based on the fact that Lukáš is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens with Latata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, Josef Šural from Liberec gave a hat trick with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata is doing.
If he can’t be available on Wednesday, I’m not saying I can’t nominate any of the players who have taken an interest in the Czech league,” Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a training in Strahov, on Tuesday there is a classic pre-match training before a duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will strive for the first victory under Vrba.
In the previous three games, he has won two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is then scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
Pesice goes to the Dutch to Italy
Vrba is glad that he has more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
It’s an advantage when you have eight days of players and you can practice certain things with them that we didn’t have so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba said.
Before the match in Prague, the Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary national coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's in the match.
But it’s not just about him, we’ll have a game and we’ll talk about it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to statistics, winter house prices have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the Data CoreLogic Hedonic index, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Tim Lawless, director of research at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
Figures from RP Data show that apartment prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin with price increases of between five and six percent on average.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was hit by state-sanctioned spending cuts, with prices rising by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the persistent high auctioning rate, generally high sales rates, and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, “I love you.”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a colder relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is upbeat.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother’s death, Henry went through a “thorough” therapy and now he’s thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - would go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of hitting cricket.
I've never talked to him like that before.
For most of my life, he's been a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he had glimpsed what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where the flames are exploding and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the bath and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly start singing to himself because he was washing the foundry off of himself.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started thinking, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, with whom he was married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes started to show, the doctor said, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
No one wants to eat carrots alone.
A change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he plunged into the theatre.
It was followed by A Comedy Full of Errors and The Fences of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television."
He was learning on the move.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make working jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed up as blacks, Henry eventually performed his comedy in it for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I wish it would never happen, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years and years' prized major product of British television" was also "a grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
He spent the next decade on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and roles in movies, but after airing his television series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, “So what are you going to do now, Len, it seems like you’re stuck in one place or you’re getting a little out of the way.”
Next up was a documentary program on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it properly in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave twenty lines from Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
“That’s what it’s about. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, learn something about it.
So the rehearsing was tough, and I read the game for months and months before that.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which they didn’t.
He soon began acting in a comedy full of errors.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the seizure of the audience.
“A voice in my head said to me, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can do it for me.
“You’re playing, so stay in the role.”
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the plot text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a loud voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains the brain of a comedian - all the time interrupting our conversation with humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you’re always looking for something, you can end up in a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked him if he would ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent workers
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register will no longer receive pay in the next two weeks.
The government believes that thousands of people receive their pay even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to stop corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars ($700,000) a month in salaries of non-existent employees and in the event of further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be put into bank accounts even after an employee dies or after an employee leaves the state administration, said BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All government officials are required to report to identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, the government said in a statement.
He further says that anyone who fails to show up without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“By designating real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over ‘conspiracy’ against government
Local media reported that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government".
The police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time Prime Minister) called their actions part of the action of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools have reopened, but that he is determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It brings with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, a consulting firm, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and to the media world of Pearsons.
She was the Executive Director of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when her younger colleague took the top job at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her severance was approaching a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former BP director, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inward to the top tier of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also outward to the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work out.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which requires thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming to a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, breaking it down and thus robbing himself of his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As the circle of competition widens and new technology challenges old safeguards, there is a great danger in the immediate negotiation of licence fees for the BBC.
For a modest sum of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a stake in what is surely the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims to produce 96% of households, and each one costs only 40p a day.
Moreover, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, compared to 31% a decade ago.
BBC service usage patterns have changed: Today, news headlines appear on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a much-loved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Gov. Perry Says He Disapproved of Offensive Tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, released on Sunday, featured an insulting image of a Democratic state attorney who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, distancing himself from the previous one.
A tweet that wasn't authorized left my account.
"I don't agree with the tweet and I have withdrawn it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to messages with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, bringing Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
“I don’t always drive with three times the blood alcohol limit... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry for making me responsible.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut $7.5 million from the Travis County Department of Public Interest's state fund to prosecute corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might quit by tweeting his own photo of him running near the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is "back to normal"
One of London’s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer company for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013.”
London's housing market was doing well during the downturn as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, in the last year alone, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
Berkeley’s average selling prices for private, affordable, and student housing rose by about a fifth last year, and climbed to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, London property has not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them also intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "domestic tax" that politicians came up with ahead of next May's parliamentary elections.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, will also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has lowered its forecast of London property prices rising to 3% in 2015, based on home prices already starting to fall.
According to real estate firm WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter each year.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing to Berkeley, as it raised cash for forward sales to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and this has kept forward sales.”
In June, the firm announced that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, revenue by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On the Monday before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said that Berkeley's annual returns are predicted to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Shares of Berkeley halted at 23.96 pounds this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posts nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence's photos were leaked online due to a hacker claiming to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of new actresses.
A spokesperson for Hunger Games confirmed Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "obviously violating privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker reportedly acquired the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing server, thanks to a loophole in Apple’s iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who look at the photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were genuine, saying on Twitter: "These are my alleged nude photos, people."
It's better to cut it even further. *deliberate pun*.
Buzzfeed said on Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande had denied the photos were genuine.
Excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little excitable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admits it angrily.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was an incipient love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him from the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a flighty heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south, she came with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, the Valley of Paradise.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes leaked, there were dead spiders in the baths, slugs sloppyly signed on the windows, as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to the public station that supplied the county with comforting music and soothing news, as the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old black song he had long forgotten.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned - nothing was really banned - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into desuetuda, as did the word desuetuda itself.
Folk taste has done what prescriptions and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose memoirs when it comes to books, in which the poor man becomes rich, cooks and romance novels, so in music, ballads are chosen.
The cavern let itself be swept away by the day and began to play the imaginary piano, singing in a crude, comical voice the serenade of Ailla's large feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
“That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,” he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was young.
His father told him he was playing with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at the word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly outlawed, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room for one “if”.
When she started playing the melody, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed by the song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when her favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure, either.
A permissive society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, with temperament and constitution, were suited for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for ensuring that no family would be without a working phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained were washing dishes.
Those in the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED - were afraid that they would be blamed for putting them in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would consume them next - they opened restaurants where labneh was sold and smoked water pipes, they did not draw attention to themselves.
To each according to his talent.
As she listened only to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could come out of the foul words that Kavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
“They’re not really stupid,” Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
Not a word could escape from the sound-proofed leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
“It was funny,” he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevern’s view.
There was nothing in the whole wide world but the muddle of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not the feet at all.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
“Your thick ankles are just attracting me,” he tried.
I'm kind of a pervert.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from the couch, dropped the radio, and spilled the undried wine.
It was wine, so it wasn’t worth the drink.
She seemed to tremble in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m sick of being a fool,” she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both because of her unkind words and because of the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up to him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but there was no doubt that it was the same in the foundations as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was crumbling over them.
The same deranged men, after WHAT HAPPENED, even more touchy and grumpy than their ancestors, smugglers and miscreants, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay a hand on any woman who would dare refuse them or laugh at them.
Jerk?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, cuddle it - cuddle it became the most common expression for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: the antidote to the bland ballads of love that the radio spewed - first cuddle it, then hit it.
In Kevern's view, over-cultivation because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt angry herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from the upstairs window - the man she had caught up with.
Adam was leaving the garden, she thought.
She was heartbroken for him and for all the men in general, even though a few of them had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders drooping, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment, until now that she'd seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where its mitigation or outright cessation was most expected if enough money and energy were spent to eliminate it.
“A lot has been done and a lot still needs to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggressiveness of people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the country’s slumped, hard-to-reach places, where, despite the peaks of church towers rising above hedges, the touch of human kindness has rarely appeared historically.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is old brutality held as stubbornly in rural areas as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, on the road, and even on sports fields, new non-violence appears.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery in style," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you gay?
Esme once again objected to her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking,” Rabinowitz finally said, “that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unbiased companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the Church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Still dealing with WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, prepares the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board flashed pink recommendations that Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than a written one, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, when she was sure her supervisor was finished, "and I'm not saying that the wound didn't heal the way we think it did.
My concern is, first of all, that if we are not notified in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the ends of his fingers.
It meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps your grandparents may have taken and may not have made as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting your “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “we are not without fault.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing more to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to be blamed, there are no things to be corrected, even if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to that...
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing her.
A day later, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who rammed her onto the sidewalk in a way that passersby described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Kingdom of Lesotho military says no coup plans - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied orchestrating a coup to overthrow the government, claiming they acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had encircled his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After saying he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the military’s response to the threat of “political fanatics” the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the leadership of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several messages from the information service that there were several groups in the ranks of the police planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc on the country,” he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, it appears that the actions of the Lesotho defense forces bear signs of a coup d’état,” he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and it was quiet in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was targeted because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament in June over internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Eurozone production is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely monitored survey.
The final euro area Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
The decline in new orders and factories has damaged growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US did during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the drag that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on producers is becoming increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The industry slowdown is likely to fuel analysts expecting to implement additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August purchasing managers’ production overview is that it shows the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Manufacturers in the euro area are currently living a very difficult life, because the growing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected trade - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said that it appeared “even more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of the hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of a busy school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were taken hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific occupation of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy connected East and West, which in this disastrous disaster led to action and the future.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted misfortune, though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
May the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - be over.
A girl trying to crawl back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, only in his underwear trying to crawl back into a bombed-out school gymnasium after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida desperately searches for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
“A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
There's bits of splinters in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
Once a year I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate, Jera Gapoeva, was killed there.
When we were kids, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children begin school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbing the baby by the arm and running away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with her leg injured, thinking on the contrary that her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was declared the winner by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where he and his friends have suffered as much because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I’m so sorry for anyone who has to go through this horror,” says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to work for the police, and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say personally that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still don’t think the world has changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet kid, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six of his classmates, and he goes to the gym from time to time and they light candles there.
When he was little, he had trouble with it - I remember him sometimes lying on the couch with his face away from us and sometimes lying like that for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing out all his guns or other toy guns, and Damir's 17, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for several hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw this hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran.
Our lives go on unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin and his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
When he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was ingrained in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it gets harder and harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn’t feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Ever-Returning Memories: A photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of Grigori in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we have it hidden in our library.
I get it, but I also think that's how people all over the world know how much pain we're in.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth will never be found out.
Now they're investigating the crash of the boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
There's something very wrong with this world.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, they don’t want war, how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, it takes decades.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares about the attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, when September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for health's sake, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregoriy Farniyev was kept at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was trapped in a gymnasium, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
“It feels like yesterday,” said Gregorij, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but couldn’t because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now I’m older and they say kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that’s not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sit in this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
When it comes to my physical health, I’m fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I walk normally now.
But even so, for health reasons, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they answered that it was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished my second year there.
She learns how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It’s not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be there.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I will be attending the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because unlike me, he was there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn’t help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorius is an adult today, but he carries that terror on.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that 50% has already overcome the horror, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but it pains me to lose the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not get married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, so how did we get to fight each other now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who took a special commando to safety
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carrying a Russian special commando to safety (left).
Now she is ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when a Russian police officer carried little Alyona out of Beslan in his arms.
She was released, but held captive in the school gym by her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and they have a little girl named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend stated that "it's a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in underwater photography or shooting, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs around $ 300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, all costing less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and rating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose your photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater it will be hard to see and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the subject.
That’s great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimming light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could change things even in an organization as vast as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and diseases, the vast majority of patients treated are interested in something completely different: pain.
But one day in 2007 he was the one who started suffering.
“I don’t feel like myself,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found himself impatient and reproached his wife Juliet.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him an X-ray of his chest.
Two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-rays came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
The mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a building fiber material that was previously described as "miraculous", but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma was not difficult to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was in use, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as the insulation depositors, the builders, the carpenters, and the shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such complacency is out of place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of deaths from car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, despite the fact that the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
The mesothelioma, therefore, does not respect the social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools do not constitute shelter.
The house is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put down the isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years on the practice,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who have been to Guy’s Hospital and who have developed mesothelioma in the past five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I’m the only one still alive.”
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us get the same disease?”
Professor Julian Pete, a leading British expert on mesothelioma, said the best estimate was that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic took place in Britain, about 90,000 people would die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory look at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and require compensation, shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, Marks & Spencer admitted this June that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, overseeing the clothing section in two stores - one of the locations being the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He now has two children who are in their 20s.
“Before it happened,” he says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me in my dreams that he might have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name thanks to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is most commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say there is “convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known asbestos exposure at work or home were likely due to exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to "normal use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the centre of the government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report claiming that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Service Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate", it is now foreseen that it will take one million pounds and several years of work for Parliament to be thoroughly inspected, electricity to be modernised and asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 election MPs will be sitting on the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown to be present,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
I suddenly trembled.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make it home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He spent a month at home.
Confused doctors X-rayed his chest and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the lining of his chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm optimistic.
“I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year’s: “They told me it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“Asbestos has been shown to be widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop the disease.
So mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement of hospitals, making them unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who passed through basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (like often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients’ lives, but also a place that could threaten the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's burner on asbestos pads
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-combustible properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in the countless chemistry classes, students were building Bunsen's burner on an asbestos mat.
A website has been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember, in the 1970s, while demolishing a garden house.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while to figure it out,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of doctor to the position of patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all that,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during their practice at the hospital.
Asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
It is invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work as much.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer “doesn’t respond much to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect” but doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: “Hello, you have reached the cancer centre.”
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would likely extend his life by just a month.
“I was desperate,” he said.
I was gonna give up.
But Lawson “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me out,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a requisition, and they would have to approve the reimbursement.
For patients with mesothelioma, the question of money is crucial.
But when different treatments inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries - about the future of the family they leave behind.
So they go to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
However, in the 1960s, it was discovered that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Treating exposure to deadly asbestos to a single company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
Insurance records are lost.
And those who defend themselves now have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been passed this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek a settlement, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve that is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks that 350 million pounds is a “good job.”
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma would have been able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the bill “had loopholes.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that due to the seven deaths each year, swift action was required.
“People are suffering too much and need help now,” Penning said last December during a second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended the operation, which, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast of a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
It strengthened Abbott.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Checkups showed no signs of illness.
I went for another checkup in March [2014].
I had a few lumps in my chest [cancer].
My fiftieth birthday was approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of the tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how an alarm clock on a boiler works.
When you hear bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to have this kind of conversation.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and ultimately brought Stephen Jay Gould) a joyless certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the mesothelioma is not life threatening.”
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in an asbestos cloth.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen cooking pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
A fabric that is non-combustible was invented.

In Italy, asbestos is beginning to appear in commercial use, used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, followed soon by America, Italy and Russia.
During the Industrial Revolution, it is an excellent insulating agent in steam engines and turbines.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Statistics from Prudential show that people working with asbestos have higher mortality rates, and they are then denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, deny responsibility.
They won't pay any settlement.
During the Second World War, ships were built intensively, and work in shipyards posed the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of blue asbestos imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute of Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All types of asbestos are banned in the UK.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act comes into force.
A 350-million-dollar compensation program is running.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material in many parts of the world.
Global production is at 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China’s parliament decided Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite proliferating debates on democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress basically allows Communist leaders to vote off any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“We were not surprised, but we were enraged,” said Democratic Party leader Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that, starting in 2017, residents will be able to elect an executive.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in the hands of the committee's nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of Hong Kong's biggest and most watched protests in several years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they will launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement “considered the occupation of Central only as a last step if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We must announce with regret that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday strengthened protections for the government's headquarters and deployed police officers and barricades.
Inciting riots is a sign, according to many Hong Kong residents, that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the lifeboat of Hong Kong.
“The protest he’s talking about could do much more economic damage depending on how many people are participating and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This perception could hurt investments.
In recent days, Chinese state media has also released reports portraying Hong Kong’s democratic activists as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitator?
The league in Jihlava is named after the political movement
About 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
Tenth on his list is also the head of the small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football was already dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava town hall and they recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, according to the city’s website, the small football team received about a million crowns.
This year it is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small football does not violate the law or the guidelines of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the office to modify the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small football support in the elections of one political party, this will probably not be possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to Vysočina's "big" football.
That the ČSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1 could be created.
Classes and competitions like that?
I wouldn't go for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be contacted by sponsors from among the companies," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of a small football party and the movement will not allow the name of the league
According to players of small football, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own complex with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the course Na Stoupách is not ours, we are renting there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka said.
The Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football pitch uses playgrounds with artificial grass in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been a lot of progress for small kicks over the last few years," he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mrák.
We have limitations.
If someone from one industry enters into a partnership with us, we do not put the other one there,” he explained.
"I consider the political movement in the name of the league to be at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the city council's sports committee.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr Mráka is using the association Malá Kopana Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly in a jet plane
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to carry their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to bringing our VIF (very important fresher) variants to students this year, ensuring that they arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that as services have only just started, they do not yet have any reservations, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of 9,000 pounds, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving on campus, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists oppose racism and police behaviour after Ferguson events
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed youth.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed youth Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has seen a shift in online discussions by white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prioritize gender over race.
With tensions in the Midwest drawing attention to the national press, Perez noticed that the white woman’s reaction was 100% race-focused.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "White woman's reflections on Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level,” she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the Ferguson situation] is so racially defined that they had to draw attention to it.
Koritha Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, said Ferguson had brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories about my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the coloreds are trapped in their own country, it is deafening silence.
“How is it possible for a woman to talk publicly about relationships, but not about safety in a public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
Black women, she said, could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor lecturing on the women's issue and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason for this was almost all rapes of white women," Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of a white woman to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
“They decided to bet on the right to vote for women and to focus on the right for blacks later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to start organizing against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the upsurge in white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the issues that black women have faced for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” she asked.
The second wave of feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian calling for white Americans to protest racism more vigorously.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and views on race that differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses an intersectional feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on the race issue in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments to Ferguson’s party face criticism she has raised previously.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only issue that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest this year, the issue of immigration law reform once again arose - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to raise the issue as a necessary one for women, all she had to do was share stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position of vulnerability when it comes to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have an impact on women’s organizations,” she said.
Lives of pigs in Ipswich for sale
A real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-room detached house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The informational photos included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the sofa of a pig.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was found there by mistake and has already been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In the property information, the Connells real estate agency described the former prayer house as "a single, separate one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in south-east Perth, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's sweepstakes.
The Harvey Traffiks were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time being a $1 million prize in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was being talked about by the entire city in southwestern Perth.
It's a major issue, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like that was a touch.
The eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player at Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, the couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning pair had been betting for twenty years and said the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, having won $85 million in total.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not leave in the evening.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose a time out of rush hour.
The chosen strike time takes into account many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting during the day," the union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should mainly affect freight, less passengers," the GDL added.
The DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is also not clear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in train drivers’ wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept salary increases while reducing working hours.
They stress that drivers’ remuneration must develop in the same way as other railway staff, for whom DB does not count the reduction of the working week.
There was a danger that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he stopped at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn’t think anything like that would happen.
Could the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were headed there straight away, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and that was not possible.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you've passed five special stages.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the vintners.
Everything was due to the fact that the car has been beeping for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You made it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The job didn't come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought about did not appear.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one to drop out of the championship early.
Foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also fell out.
Are you surprised that so many of your favourites have dropped out?
Yeah.
It was a pity for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, whose car you are preparing, has also been at the top for a long time.
However, he took a flight from the track and picked up almost a two-minute short.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the podium.
He was in the first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good driving feeling make you a regular rally participant again?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race and I didn’t keep it.
I decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I think I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't do too much damage to the car.
In addition, he wants to borrow from us for this race fabia Honza Sýkora.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican rally was part of the World Rally Championship, you reached your maximum in the series in fifth place.
Don’t you want to try the tracks again?
It doesn't.
Working with an employer can be a problem.
Unfortunately, you did not get a certificate of incapacity from the doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you can not perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
It was then agreed that the days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the Labour Code does not impose the obligation to have the employer’s consent to take leave confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proven itself.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, can be considered a long-term unexcused absence from work, thus a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labor Code.
In the event of a legal dispute with your employer, you will lack demonstrable proof.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been terminated under section 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit card as an unexcused absence.
An unexcused absence from the credit card does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of obtaining material security in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him/her confirm in writing that an accident has really occurred, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "inability to work", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
This will avoid any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
Returning to the track ended for Tony Stewart just past half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire broke in lap 172, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, did not comment to the reporters, and left.
Team Principal Chad Johnston said the #14 team was disappointed, but would now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I would like us to have a better performance and a better finish,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping to do better there.
Stewart hit the barrier for the first time in Sunday's evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
“We were hoping for a good finish in today’s race,” Johnston said, adding: “It just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York City race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and for that he needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race at Richmond to catch up with the place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had driven Stewart in the way during the race, died.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked his way up to 10th and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, coming out of the second corner and crashing into Stewart's, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 per year for the same places for taxi drivers.
This was reported by Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw to select trustees.
The winner then received a rental for a lump sum of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently being decided.
"A year since the original lease contracts were terminated and the tender procedures were launched, it has been proven that the new lease system is much more advantageous and fairer overall for Prague," the councillor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the location in Na Perštýně street.
They pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for places in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
New rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
Selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We released it every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured in Savo.
That's an incredible smell!
Our well in the basement always provided plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, my grandfather dug it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
It was just for three turns and overall peculiar, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
Even then, the water didn’t smell.
We wondered if something had gone down.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there the board was not quite so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
On the ground was a package with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little bit more.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were the remains of a fish!
And hard going!
Our cellar is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only stifled sand, only the ceiling is conquered.
They mainly ship there.
And wheels.
And sun loungers on the beach.
The doors with wide gaps were usually open, as someone was walking there all the time.
At the ceiling several of the above-mentioned vents.
Without a net, so it is common for birds to fly there and build nests on the beams.
There is no point in mentioning mice.
Grandpa wanted it to work, and it did.
But now Luft didn't help either.
The whole basement smelled.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: planks, a heraclitus board, and so on.
Our cottage at a distance welcomed passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We wondered, who could have put the disgusting remains there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
It would be hard for her to come over for a snack.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who was not well.
If he's not the one who shoved the disgusting stuff in our air vents?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to monitor the basement and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests are done, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza jumped over her and squealed like a fool.
Her mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially rolled into the ball and partially straightened.
There was hissing on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical fit.
We ran down.
The grasshopper, over a metre long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Reza prevented it from doing so.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the power in the form of our whole family, she probably said to eat it when we are so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the vent to the cellar.
We followed her.
Like lightning, she jumped over the well.
By the way, we noticed another stinking package on her record.
The smell of fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit tricky.
We closed the store during the day.
That she would...
We went outside and each of us came to one of the vents.
We didn't wait long.
It hit the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow marigolds on the neck.
Then the whole snake swung to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to get inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought the company laptops and sold them
After being fired, the employee bought the computer and then sold it.
He was able to spend the money before being arrested by the police.
In a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"After the takeover, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Brueckner, the chief commissioner of the Šumperk police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for the dismissal and also the profit of money.
"He told us during the interrogation that he had used the money to pay off the loans," he said.
The police also found out that the fraudster is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated for psychiatry.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has already been punished for theft, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
So far, police have not said whether there is a threat of punishment for bazaars that bought laptops under the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has been charged yet.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared a few changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the target to the embankment, instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
Together with the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photos and filmed videos together.
To bring my perspective to perfection, I took on the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Katya, we obediently sat at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who passed by us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
Couple of minions to warm up, turn on the sport testers, countdown and start!
Shouts of cheer, but instead of a quick start followed by a squat to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and run at a pace of ten o’clock.
We will intertwine with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost a trashy touch.
The pulsating mass stretching along the embankment looks as if the whole of Prague was running here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how much power.
The light hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or go for a walk.
Just before the crossing to the Theatre I see a police escort and right after him Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the finish.
I can hear the sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to slap me, but just before that my leg twists and our hands narrowly miss.
The confluence of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and respite.
There are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I don't breathe and my legs carry me almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment comes the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, Katya scurries over the curb and performs a jump in a float.
I see if she needs help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue down the Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but it is still necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I don’t know yet that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap with everyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Kate, because ten claps with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the fighter run has begun.
We beat dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to cheer him up with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
After the last snack, no one overtakes us, we accelerate.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really need to work.
The sun is already slowly setting and the ending day symbolically ends the race.
The last run to the bridge, turn and just straight to the finish line.
The pace at which we are running amazes me, where does this girl come from?
"Come on, let's go under 1:00, let's go!"
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can I do?
Coach set a time limit of 20.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just after the goal Kate's legs are bent, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
The euphoria doesn't make us think of the crowd in the closet passages.
Here you can see that the Goat Lane was not the narrowest place.
This is the goal of the embankment, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners crammed to bursting.
If you don’t like crowds, this is not the place for you.
After a while, I lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and more interesting route than previous years were worth what is happening in the destination.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If you add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in Žluté lázně was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators escalated it on each meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the urban run through the historic center, obstacles must be taken into account that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of the mass race in a place that is bounded by a wall on the one hand and a river on the other as the best solution.
If I say that the race ended by running the goal, I rate it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you also liked the route and what do you think about the situation at the finish.
Bulgarian prison guards hold protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have changed recently.
The list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
Peacekeepers for a month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“Negotiations are still ongoing,” Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Workers' Trade Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the Universe Can Have More Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists don't usually write best-sellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit the jackpot in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to get to the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are now dealing with - an attempt to unite two well-functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene dealt with the complex material so fresh and engaging that it is impossible to blame him for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Perhaps the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics by Greene.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
However, it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you stretch a hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the whole scenery from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily detect a long, horizontally stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Because of its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you answer with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You are beginning to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the hose and where is the circle wrapping the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (Experts note that this chapter focuses purely on broken string theory.
These are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the perimeter, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension wrapping the circumference of the hose is short, "twisted" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they divide into two groups.
They can be either large, sprawling and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, coiled and much more difficult to observe.
Of course, in the above case, we did not just push ourselves to reveal the "twisted" dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.
Just take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or capillary - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein an article in 1919, in which he came up with the amazing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions.
Kaluza's radical claim was justified by the fact that the extra dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework within which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises how this Kaluza observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that just like dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of every moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have even additional dimensions, tightly coiled into space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense row of circles on the circumference of the hose in black.
The outside of the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, we will now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily thanks to the drawing, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together, four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little, let us note the illustrations in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of space in a similar way as we have enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are coiled into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid depicts commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle represents a new, tiny, and coiled dimension.
Just like the loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual size - just for the sake of illustration, we have drawn them only to the intersections in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 shows a commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters,shown by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
But as we move beyond the microscopic properties of space geometry - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, coiled dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to a loop of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the large dimensions, much like a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large dimension of only one.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, to recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much more difficult than to observe the obvious, large and sprawling dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-the-art enlargement tools.
But the most important thing is that the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three common vast dimensions.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions as independent as the top-down, left-right, and front-back dimensions are independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small anteater could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than can be seen with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely observe the smaller coiled dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the newly emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension might be about one Planck length, far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional tiny spatial dimensions a Kaluza-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice the electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-tact harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Anyone interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By education, a puppeteer and a puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, has been living as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which, unfortunately, can not be left.
He is a guitarist after his father, as is his brother Matěj, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, you just need to apply it to the harmonic model of twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what you can think of with twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add the fourth, watch for a change in tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will go back to the pentatonics and try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it well.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of electric guitar playing here.
Another goal without waiting?
It’s not a big celebration, admits Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances in the first half, the second home,” said the striker, who scored from a penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when you played it, but you were accompanied by a great whistling noise?
I didn’t notice it especially, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You scored the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, there was a corner and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal until the break.
In the cabin we said that we wanted to keep the pace of the game after her, but we couldn’t do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the locals said something about their game about the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
On the field of the opponent you scored for the first time, while at home you may not have even scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, that’s a different category.
Four matches you were waiting for the goal, were you not afraid that it might be similar after the last match?
Probably not, but of course we are glad that since the last match we do not have to listen to the talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer distant crater.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun region near the Vatnajikull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This is what scientists are most concerned about...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
As of yesterday morning (31.8.
In 2014, approximately the same amount of lava is still released from the crack.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50x bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the intensity shown by the current eruption, it would mean massive flooding, both on the Jukulsa River and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as it was in the case of the Fimmv-Ruháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger, and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Hoskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of the sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange level (second highest) applies to Bár-arbunga and the yellow level (third highest) applies to Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Air Day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 featured aerial acrobat Peggy Valentine, who climbed out of the cockpit in flight to a trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There, it depends only on the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting air pieces again.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on the wings" performed by German acrobat Peggy Valentinova, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his bright cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to assert themselves.
However, due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of aviation days.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit onto the upper wing after taking off.
He does various exercises there.
Towards the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the show, then the Mustang's subsequent performance was the icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter flew to the surface with Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called on the numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
It was built during the war, but probably never took part in it.
He was placed in the Army Reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Like a racing plane.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
At the same place is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no big machine at the airport.
Its polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired in the colours of the French Air Force.
A small transport plane stopped behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Hof to the air day.
German neighbors in Cheb demonstrated with the reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or the three-man formation of the biplanes, B -cker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhyová exchanged her parents' worries for her work ones at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was doing well with the TV news, as if she hadn’t given up on him for two months!
It’s only been two weeks since the blonde ended her six-year-old life, when women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news channel TV Nova.
According to information from Blesk.cz, it will be back in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans a farewell Jagr
It would be nice if this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition entitled "Golden Match", in which the impressive Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
The players would like that, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would just be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, they can be found during the tournament one or two days when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégra) or Beď Ščerban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play in the New Jersey playoffs?
If I fly in like this...
You don’t want to play in representation.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in representation.
It’s one thing that people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Championships.
That's where players should go, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy that nagan reunion?
Meeting the players was great.
You liven up stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first game?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young guys: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we started in one trio.
It was the first official start for everyone.
If we are to dominate in some way, that is impossible to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hašek has been catching for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hashanah on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can’t (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to finish in the national team).
He was also very good at showing off.
He was training with me one night, and he was leaky.
And now he's got a big catch.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, football players start qualifying
Prominent guests came to the NH Hotel in Smíchov on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black cap, it's Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the rendezvous around 11:30 among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be excited?” he said, as he appeared before journalists in a representative set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1st: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná)
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday training for them, which starts at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which neither Rosicky nor Czech will miss.
Otherwise, the national team will be more relaxed.
This is praised by coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things for which there has not been so much time before," Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January, said.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has played three games, all in preparation.
She tied 2-2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage a rematch against the USA.
The first half of the year was to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about it in order to be successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player with a 23-man nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he didn't recover by Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba would have called in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after being misdiagnosed for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can manifest as motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Affected people may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms get worse.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA), a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead by the time she was thirty.
A mother of two, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor’s leaving the room, and looked into her documentation to find out that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my skills.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or you’d be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it will be something much less dangerous."
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turnover of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
And higher taxes too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country accelerated the recovery of the economy last year grew slightly, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia collectively contributed $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, up 3.8% from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both national and local - rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% last year, and it was the third consecutive growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were cut.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the lowest business tax revenue.
Researchers say the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of property owned by firms, raising property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth of -1% by 3.7 percent.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be the case in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% from $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“Maryland has a lot of corporate real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot only be attributed to a recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business income seems to be increasing as well.
Companies in the region posted a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same pace in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three counties (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporation tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Business tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax -- the structure of compensating cost increases by raising prices that most companies are organized under -- in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, it rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and nationwide business tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenue from sales to state and local governments rising to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind others, as cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin’s Novorussia and Lafat’s scissors will be the boss of Europe
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in south-eastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support given to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
He said that the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has won the right to disagree with part of
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose within a week a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU summit decided today.
This was stated by the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new president of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the head of the European Council, the so-called EU president who manages the summits of member countries.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two-and-a-half years.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will become Vice-President of the next European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

Seventy years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege began.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, consistently requested that the technical equipment be replenished and sent to the front.
The British side eventually complied and included this land unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

Joan Rivers family: “We keep our fingers crossed”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the one-eighty-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call to the emergency services, according to which she had a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
Reactions did not take long, including incredible online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted headlines
That the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the word is more apt.
This is especially true of the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headline is “Israel Attacks Gaza.”
Only in the text you can read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
It then appears the headline "Both sides have broken the truce".
Does the journalistic community realize that it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been more than 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and similar infidelities, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to finish?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews the Slavs were destined to be liquidated?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also note one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go to "their" country, say, Gaza, they will answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top-notch health care (I saw for myself how the top private hospital Hadassah, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, is also commonly visited by Arabs and, of course, treated there).
Hamas has also fired missiles at its Arab brothers.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about Hamas's practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
Report that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area may have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, but for which the Gazan administrators do not pay, and they are even angry that the power supply is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate the territory of Israel, but, for example, in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning’s claim: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Google’s $1 billion sale of Twitch seemed certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online games on it - in Business Insider's words, "YouTube for Live Gaming".
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube, there are already popular videos of "Let's play", a kind where wise men (mostly older ones) give games a processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when describingTwitch, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch has not excited anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, despite the company being willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmet Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, have the same values and long-term vision, and want to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer sports to watching, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about watching games instead of actually playing them.
It’s one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder play Resident Evil at 3:00 a.m., and it’s another thing to watch a stranger get twenty hits on the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from the player’s perspective, so looking at their footage without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a hemlock.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of acting or humor, his channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube might have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games,” and the media doesn’t seem to be reluctant, even as - swallowed - viewers.
The second lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Attached original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often present us with the question: Who will you believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human investigation were utterly futile in comparison with the authority they imagine their doctrine to have.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to the "word of God", they refer to the myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added further rows of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It's like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, plot.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts pretending to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of the angels, but those texts were written by nothing but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the uber-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not compete with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a profound morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire each reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and they are all constantly breaking down into increasingly separate denominations, seeking questionable truths, and each in some way claiming divine guidance, regardless of continued diverging and separating in every way.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Zarathustra Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God" and the believers are said to be.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the wrong track to some extent.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence and none can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I’m not saying that I’ve proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith as well as apologies (defences) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive notions once considered to be true that have already been overcome.
So they cannot be claimed to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with each also being able to contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often biased politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it a contradiction, but rather mutual comments.
We have to point out once again that we have two different authors whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and it is certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of "Moses" and do not attribute to Moses the authorship of any of them, since they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by the docets and ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these adaptations refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebulah, "Lord on the Mount" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple handshake, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Church of Rome at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon was thus developed from the seat of the early Church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if God were the real author of this accidental mixture of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was definitely written by people and certainly not by much enlightenment, rather the opposite!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, they believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by ignorant and bigoted savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, violence against children, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against the nation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do the will of God.
However, creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God Himself, and even insist that refuting their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
All that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "unchanging word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and twisted by mere erring people.

Chinese school student stabbed nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen violently entered the primary school building at around 11:30 a.m. local time, according to the New China Agency.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policy.

The smallest schoolchildren were taken to their class, where they waited with the teacher for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that is not waiting for you, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-graders as a gift to the puzzlers.

"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more," explained one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of the Czech Republic.
He was recently approached by the school management at a hockey game in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, there were 115,000 first graders.
In total, over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, according to the Ministry of Education.
The new art director of Nova news is David Fiala
David Fiala became the new art director of Nova TV news and journalism on 1 September.
He will succeed Alan Záruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of the Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the news programs Televízní noviny, Sřepina, Prásk! and other journalistic programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala knows very well the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the art director’s work.
It has a sense of typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to follow in the visuals of the Novy news,” says Novy’s creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple's iCloud reportedly hacked, naked celebrity photos leaked to the public
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on 4chan has posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, according to Mashable.com.
They were allegedly gained through unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, which the affected users uploaded through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Die Hard 4.0, for example.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
According to reports on 4chan, the hacker is reportedly interested in the footage, but he prefers to get money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it’s very likely a vulnerability in iCloud’s security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that allowed you to get passwords to user accounts through brute force, that is, by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before publishing this tool.
As a precautionary measure, iCloud users should change their Apple ID password.
What is important is the length of the password, not its complexity.

The leak of nude celebrity photos is seen as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are much better secured than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and when connected to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in a timely manner, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete the failed images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy space in the online storage.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
The Smart Way to Save for College Scripts
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, an upcoming second-year student has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from high school classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I got a math book that normally costs $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have various options to manage these expenses.
Online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s are becoming the preferred choice for students.
Lending textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Neebo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the learning texts are bought in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the learning texts used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their tutors to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If yes, older editions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lending
Borrowing textbooks is also worth considering, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the store where you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlights, or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don’t return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of electronic licenses valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends Calculus for six months for about $61.
Thus, according to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, since many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be joining Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN as it guarantees you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the internet, make sure it’s really in stock, advises Gault.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Mud, mud.
And then they found a torso of rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We discovered the vegetation around and began to pull out an aged deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we were approaching the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it to be the torso of the German assault rifle used by the SS.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them,” added Novak.
All the wooden construction things have decomposed over time, so it is useless.
Its body is well preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
It may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed back.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't have done it.
“They were throwing guns in the woods,” he said.
The rifle was the only thing that the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end up in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not freed a captured Czech yet
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take this... they call me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
In every such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Yesterday - when we had the conversation - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is being carried out 24 hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates them at 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I liberated Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captured compatriot and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and are captured by the separatists, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be hired mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, a Czech - they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in the war.
Q: How many Ukrainian prisoners have you saved?
If I understand correctly, it's an exchange.
Some sources say that it has long exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
But we only freed them... from the war if they chose to continue the fighting.
Rescuers are doctors in war, surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained a lot of authority and even trust among the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "mad general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that describes the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers’ Corps, I have gained some of that authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even if it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or for the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long pause) ... both Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
It only happens on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There is no evidence that the Ukrainian military is doing anything similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give figures.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don’t want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to life and death.
As we say, they were eaten to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were expressed by people on Maidan, by the way.
Now let me speculate: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other one to be small.
This sentence, however, hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and I show soldiers or militants outstretched bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters at gunpoint or in the optical sight.
I can see the faces of people who point their guns at me all the time... and they can pull the trigger at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if it does, it's like a little gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be a kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
Speaking of characters, in a Ukrainian TV talk show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, clueless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
In those 300 meters of walking, I always get scared at least five times.
So why should I hide the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
Q: Do you think he was involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk a "king".
And the rabbit in the eyes of Ukrainians is not an animal to be feared or to have respect and authority with others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg for it, to play with its intrigues, to threaten to lay down his office... he must run the country, administer it and even protect it in times of war.
If the country is threatened, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for weeping emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he has never been strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save Sales
Sylvester Stallone's three expendables returned less than $30 million from a $90 million budget in the U.S., and Sin City: The Woman I'd Kill for returned only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during its first weekend, and films for children such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to Robbie Collin’s article in The Telegraph, the very quality of children’s films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films set for a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between Victims' Day and July 20, 2013 and that year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, it may be to blame for the change in the attitude of viewers and the higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was already there.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood box office blockbusters, Netflix’s net profit was $1.2 billion, nearly double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň, and Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in sales simply “cyclical.” He told Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history and no one will worry about selling.”
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR near the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a point in the north-west of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea has apparently launched a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud-type missiles.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters arriving from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO young hikers were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man hiked to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police at around 8 p.m.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Vasicek
The 23-year-old forvard was able to decide, but failed in the two biggest chances.
The goal was called mainly by the shot three minutes before the end, but instead of the net she ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
“I’m angry at myself,” he said, throwing his ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it under the lid, I was a little high," he mumbled.
The defense of Sigma did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikula's 11th minute run, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáci began to push, but in the block defending the home they did not let go and shots from a distance caught Květoň.
Fifteen minutes we compared each other, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more from the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vasicek didn’t change the chance, so it ended 0-0,” said Leoš Kalvoda, the coach of Hanaks.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the line-up, where apart from the two injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík were also missing.
Unlike its predecessors, it did not allow them to participate.
The replacements deserve a discharge.
Sigma was more footballing, but with one standard, we didn’t let it go,” said Slezanů coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma was tied for four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the club Josef Lébro, who, after defeating Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the box office subject to diametrically different performances in subsequent matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there can be no talk about the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noticed and added to the sleeping shooter's address: "I believe that it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I will replace him immediately so that he can save his goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has been in Venice twice.
The film festival is experiencing a crisis differently
After a huge enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Inárritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days indicated that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice had somewhat subsided.
Either because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and allegedly it has ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute place in a hotel.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present only in connection with films.
While younger fans yearned for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had quite successfully hosted dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also appeared in two films.
In the out-of-competition story, directed by Oscar winner Barry Levison based on Philip Roth's novel, 74-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to his heart: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as a quaint hardware store owner from a rural town in David Gordon Green’s film Manglehorn was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss it - but does the artist Pacino's format still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
This year, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first film to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in it by looking at family relations between clans that are fighting each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
He was also intrigued by the chamber psychothriller Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman whose misguided anxiety almost kills her own child.
On the other hand, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception, neither the Ransom for Glory, nor 3 Hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival’s films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film She’s Funny That Way, a humorous comedy set in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American merry-go-rounds of the 1940s, managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
Four meth producers caught in Prague, drugs brought from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman who manufactured and sold methamphetamine in Prague 9 from November last year until August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Ruesslerová said in a statement.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a benefit seller.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers were caught in the area of the Malešice incinerator on Wednesday morning, August 20," the spokesperson said.
A woman was given a third of the drug for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of activities.
In the workshop of the Letná area, in the garden house in Horoměrice, in the apartment in Koněvova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, procured various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided for the transport of pseudoephedrine drugs from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and sold meth.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman who had not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," added Ruessler.
Criminals also conducted several house searches on the judge's orders, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubing and other aids and items that could be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine, according to experts.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that since 1995 the main organizer has been punished seven times for property crime, the woman has not been punished," the police spokeswoman added.
The last person to be detained was a convicted sex offender in 2006 and a 37-year-old car mechanic who has been prosecuted at large has been tried nine times since 2009.
This was mainly due to property crime.
The prosecutor accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion with the prosecutor to place them in custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other defendants.
The police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess in wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at very "interesting" prices.
For example, hand-made chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example.
If you like it, get ready for over $40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
Probably no one is surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figurine of a rising horse.
If chess doesn’t seem like a good enough gift, there’s also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (by hand, of course) in a 1:1,8 scale.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
High school and high school doesn’t make sense.
The Czech Republic has few educated people, and statistics show that gymnasts have a good job.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in the schools over the last 14 days.
These are mostly routine matters, such as moving pots from the summer storage back to the classrooms and fading chalk.
They'll have a little more fun at the Hořice grammar school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private one.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
“French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the heavily fractured left to "show its support" for a militantly socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the approval of a majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay by his side,” he said, and received applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question France’s controversial thirty-five-hour work week, despite heated arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier this week suggested loosening the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, drew a line through his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having “lost faith in the future” because of her.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme-conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists, saying she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande and Prince Manuel Valls were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
“And the new one won’t last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying she believed it could win the party early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a University of Sciences Po political scientist, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes taking place in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
More gambling rooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dog walking.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," said councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling on their territory.
But the games will not disappear, the gambling decree will not change yet.
It is the task of the new city leadership after the election.
Now we would not even technically be able to do it, for example, due to deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current assembly, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the general ban on gambling will be held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is banned in Prague 2 and Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the ordinance will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
Prague 1, which has already sent the municipality a proposal of places it would like to extend the current list of prohibited places, complains about this.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The ordinance regulating dog walking in the city is being prepared for several months, but is not yet complete.
The location of the playrooms and the issue of busking are addressed by city ordinances.
It may be issued or modified only by the City Council.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week, he placed victory for proponents of Scottish independence at his fingertips.
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making that mistake a third time, when it almost put a question on billboards across Scotland as to whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won’t get to the heart of the Scottish electorate by appealing to their wallet, nor will you earn their respect by threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots are far more likely to expel money changers from the temple than to let them dictate how they vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, is well aware of this, which is why he has repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters vote for independence and start supporting a single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland’s currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish electorate is the fairness, job opportunities, and defense of the state's health care that citizens have free of charge.
Darling supported the London bankers on the issue of the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of health care.
By saying this, Salmond "got into bed with the Conservatives".
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the "boss" association, the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he is saying is clear: Scots should not jump out and accept what they are.

Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urban

Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that we were not going anywhere and we were just lying around and swimming with grandma in the summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before stress.
New clothes when you could get them from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, already for the fifth time, whistling on the bike around the Imperial all the way back behind the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun caressed the back and shoulders, tapped the rays goodbye.
In the evening a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, moments before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, in the morning then get up at half seven.
Monday's coming.
It usually doesn’t rain, on the contrary, summer sneers mischievously in front of school.
To cling to the specter of light and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight is the school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, the boys more drawn out, the girls more busty.
There are thugs out there to avoid, but it's interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they get here.
And these grown-up girls who came in screaming, they're laughing hysterically right now, I guess something's changed in their lives over the holidays, while I've got everything going on.
And new freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why do they come here at all?
Because they must, by education war obliged.
So inside, the cold dampness of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who supposedly lends the student a key from the tin box, where textbooks can be left and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in the memory, now it does not take place, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just the idea of a stomach ache and a headache.
The head that can't even grasp the math lesson, that devilish game for the elect, which I don't belong to and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the god of fives, to hide from rehearsal, to fit in the bench and best to sublime, to be there and not to be there, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream stories about nicer girls and prettier buildings, about antennas in space, where nobody competes with anyone, humiliates nobody and undermines nobody's foot.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only day one, just like it was years ago.
She let her daughters die.
She is facing an extraordinary punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the stall of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Unassisted, she gave birth to a little girl who, after cutting the umbilical cord, wrapped it in a prepared blanket, hid it under her jacket and carried it to a roadside feeder, where she put it in bushes located several dozen meters from the road.
Born on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I had to go to the toilet, I gave birth there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school," the defendant said, saying she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the body of the child in a backpack and took it away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit states.
It could be in tens of minutes, but even a few hours after giving birth, suffocation when covering with a blanket or when putting under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, at an undisclosed time from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under a pond in Havlíčkův Brod, secretly gave birth herself.
This time in the bathroom of a loft apartment in a family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting and tying the cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packages, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of his partner.
For this reason too, he is not currently on trial, he has only been punished for a crime against the law on burial.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it seemed human to me at the time," said the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to the man and feared him.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears came to her eyes when she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching the age of majority.
She didn’t want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn’t want children because I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the babybox, but I don’t know what happened that I didn’t do that.
“I can’t explain it to you,” she told the judge.
However, she refused to act with the intention of killing the newborn.
The second child was said to have been born dead.
During her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I have limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also cut down on smoking,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to everyone that she had health problems, that she was hydrated.
And so, my friend.
The main trial will continue in the court of Hradec Králové on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk of up to 18 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise closes with $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise operator in the world, has advanced in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company that competes with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N), allowed access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruise ships and wealthy clientele.
The deal could be released this week, a source said Sunday, but warned the negotiations may still not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 with a deal of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held a 28% equity stake, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offerings include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise altogether 82% of the North American passenger volume.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoking Chinese authorities a day after the vote
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing waving the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approved that only two out of three candidates would take part in the 2017 Hong Kong election.
All candidates must first obtain the support of an appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get the pro-democracy activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong’s financial center with the protests of the “Occupy Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the election in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, will be organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on “state sovereignty” of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin’s remark was not intended to imply that areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered so that the Russian-speaking region would be given authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call on the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with the apparent strategy it has been following since the riots broke out five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya de facto independence so that instead of joining the West, it can join Russia.
In an interview on state television, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military actions to retake the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists referred to the recently occupied territory as “Novorossiya” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words, according to which the “prisoner of illusion” is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government troops are attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev’s leadership for several months, and which is intended to alleviate Russian-speaking areas’ concerns about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s move to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored the Russian leadership’s approach to resolving the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million is ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more trouble annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of Ukraine’s 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed widespread support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities, and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed the rebels’ further advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov invaded eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, strengthened by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with 500,000 inhabitants of metallurgical combined, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive action - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units broke into the Donetsk region last week to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko Involved in Photo Scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence hit the Internet in the biggest celebrity photo hack scandal.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were reportedly leaked to the public due to the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told an online newspaper that the hack was “shameless” and that those targeted were “humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have taken 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him lying around the pool.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where she was portrayed by Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A TMZ representative said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Putting photos from hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The football players of Sigma made up Lébro, even without winning.
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
In the end, only a point for a goalless draw was brought from Opava.
By their commitment and combativeness, the club boss has made up for it a bit.
Payroll money could be coming to the club soon.
"I'll keep one more game as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite not winning the match, he was convinced by the improved performance of the players.
The combativeness and commitment that we played with in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then equalized the game and in the second half it was better.
After the victory Kalvoda's wards reached, but their options did not reach the goal, and so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To our complete satisfaction, we missed only one chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Either from my side, from the side of the coach, or from the fans," Lébr said.
The pressure must be taken into account.
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of the way.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Lébro’s statement last week was left without comment by Václav Vašíček, who did not turn Sigma’s biggest opportunity in Saturday’s match.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
They all want to come at us.
Today we showed that if we all fight and ride on our asses, we can do it," he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was obvious that they took the warning of Mr. Lébro to heart.
Even before that, it wasn’t that they didn’t want to fight and slack off,” said Olomouc coach.
It was the same as the first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league is all about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
